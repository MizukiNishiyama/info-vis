Held her breathe

So unwell, when and where? We might go there, we need air

I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you, it's a virtue, and I'm too weak to wait

If I hurt you, I reimburse you

I ain't talkin' shit, I'm garglin' the toilet water
Ballin' harder, Glock 40 on me, that's the party starter
In the cell starin' at the boys like I'm on the charger
Came out at a hundred percent, money to spend
Nothin' to lose and somethin' to win, once and again

Jumped in the pool with her and her friend, none of us swim

Bussin' a move like bumps on her skin, nuts on her chin

Fuckin' with Tune just doesn't make sense, gun in my clench

Gun is so huge, I can't tuck it in, it's cuttin' my wind

Chuggin' the juice, my cup got a twin, this one is for Pimp

This one is for Screw and this one is for Nip, pour out and sip

Bubble gum cookin' banana leaves flip, Nevada heat list

Champagne, Tropicana, sweet blend, Cabana weekend

Bitches tannin', poppin' Xannies, deep end, barely blinkin'

Twirlin' on the dick like ballerinas and balance beamin'

San Juan summer, sweating winter off

Talkin' prices, goin' back and forward like a tennis ball

Talkin' business, guns start ringin', that's a business call

It's only business, take a nigga chain like it's his business card

Clips extended, hangin' out the banger, that's extension cords

He's a pussy, he can't do a thing, now that's just menopause

Bitch made and I'm the switchblade that's sharper than a sword

I gotta stay up 'cause who gon' catch a blade when it fall?

Politickin' in the penthouse like it's the Pentagon

And we feedin' sharks on the yacht, throwin' niggas off

Can't believe the thots ever thought they'd throw a nigga off

Archer greens, sparks red dots glowin' in the dark

Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and all my pillows soft

Talkin' all that gangsta shit, I loved, it sound like pillow talk

Steady is the hand that whip around the pot, I'm kitchen smart

Becky give me head, open her so wide, I hit her heart

Becky give me head, and use no Uzi, that's for intercourse

Becky give me head, and use my pubic hair as dental floss

Then of course, I put on all red, hop up in a Porsche

Fast lane, it's a man's game, meet me center court

In this sport, 24/7, no 8, nigga

Mamba mentality but we ain't got no snakes with us

Gun is so huge, I can't tuck it in, it's cuttin' my wind

Chuggin' the juice, my cup got a twin, this one is for Pimp

This one is for Screw and this one is for Nip, pour out and sip

Bubble gum cookin' banana leaves flip, Nevada heat list

Champagne, Tropicana, sweet blend, Cabana weekend

Bitches tannin', poppin' Xannies, deep end, barely blinkin'

Twirlin' on the dick like ballerinas and balance beamin'



Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick

And y'all bitches look excellent on my dick

Y'all bitches go equestrian on my dick

Go extra-terrestrial on my dick

Head spinnin' like ""The Exorcist"" on my dick

Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick

Y'all niggas like my exes, still on my dick

Y'all niggas like extra ticks on my shit

Don't slip on this banana clip, get y'all ass split

Hella bullets and an extra lip, full ass clip

Trigger puller with an extra strength, good ass grip

Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick

Y'all niggas die, X'ing 'em off my list

Y'all niggas like lesbians, y'all might kiss

Y'all niggas like protection, nigga, y'all might slip (Bah)





San Juan summer, sweating winter off

Talkin' prices, goin' back and forward like a tennis ball

Talkin' business, guns start ringin', that's a business call

It's only business, take a nigga chain like it's his business card

Clips extended, hangin' out the banger, that's extension cords

He's a pussy, he can't do a thing, now that's just menopause

Bitch made and I'm the switchblade that's sharper than a sword

I gotta stay up 'cause who gon' catch a blade when it fall?

Politickin' in the penthouse like it's the Pentagon

And we feedin' sharks on the yacht, throwin' niggas off

Can't believe the thots ever thought they'd throw a nigga off

Archer greens, sparks red dots glowin' in the dark

Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and all my pillows soft

Talkin' all that gangsta shit, I loved, it sound like pillow talk

Steady is the hand that whip around the pot, I'm kitchen smart

Becky give me head, open her so wide, I hit her heart

Becky give me head, and use no Uzi, that's for intercourse

Becky give me head, and use my pubic hair as dental floss

Then of course, I put on all red, hop up in a Porsche

Fast lane, it's a man's game, meet me center court

In this sport, 24/7, no 8, nigga

Mamba mentality but we ain't got no snakes with us

They slither, diamonds in mouth look like I ate glitter

And bae brought her bae with her, double play, nigga, ooh

Y'all niggas like, y'all niggas



Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick

Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick

[Intro: Lloyd]
I Can make your bed rock (Young Money)
I Can make your bed rock girl
Kane is in the building nigga

I Can make your bed rock

I Can make your bed rock



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad

I'm attracted to her with her attractive ass

And now we murderers, because we kill time

I knock her lights out and she still shine

I hate to see her go, but I'd love to watch her leave

But I keep her runnin' back and forth like a soccer team

Cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve

Young Money thieves, steal your hearts with ease



[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]

I like the way you walkin' if you walkin' my way

I'm that red bull, now let's fly away

Let's buy a place with all kinds of space

I'll let you be the judge and I'm the case

I'm Gudda Gudda, I putta other

I see me with her, no stevie Wonder

She don't even wonder, cause she know she bad

And I got her nigga, grocery bags



[Chorus: Lloyd]

Okay, ooohhh baby

I be stuck to you like glue baby

Wanna spend it all on you baby

My room is the g-spot

Call me Mr. Flinstone

I can make your bedrock

I can make your bedrock

I can make your bedrock girl

I can make your bedrock

I can make your bedrock



[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]

Okay I get it let me think I guess it's my turn

Maybe it's time to put this pussy when your side burns

He say I'm bad, he probably right

He pressin' me like button downs on a friday night (Ha ha ha)

I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike

Be on my low scrunch

Be on my ecko whites

He say nicki don't stop you the bestest

And I just be coming off the top as bestest



[Verse 4: Drake]

I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi

I race for your love, shake and bake, ricky bobby

I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby

Girl I gotta watch my back cause I'm not just anybody

I see them standing in line, just to get beside her

I let her see the aston or let the rest surprise her

That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her

Oh that was your girl, I thought I recognized her



[Chorus: Lloyd]

Okay, ooohhh baby

I be stuck to you like glue baby

Wanna spend it all on you baby

My room is the g-spot

Call me Mr. Flinstone

I can make your bedrock

I can make your bedrock

I can make your bedrock girl

I can make your bedrock

I can make your bedrock



[Verse 5: Tyga]

She like tannin', I like stayin' in

She like romancin', I like rollin' with friends

She said I'm caged in, I think her conscios is

She watchin' that oxygen, I'm watchin' ESPN

But when that show ends, she all in my skin lotion

No emotions, roller coasting like back, forth, hold it (Hold it [x4])

She pause like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to

Take this photo if you for me, she said don't you ever show this

I'm too loyal and too focused, to be losing and be hopeless

When I spoke this, she rejoiced it

Said your words get me open, so I closed it

Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment



[Verse 6: Jae Millz]

She ain't got a man but she's not alone

Miss independent yea she got her own

Hey gorgoues, umm, I mean flawless, well

That's what you are, how I see it, this how I call it

Yea, look at how she walk, who knew she know she bad

Do your thang baby, I ain't even mad

And I ain't leaving fast, I'm a stay a while

Hold your head chris, I'm a take her down



[Chorus: Lloyd]

Okay, ooohhh baby

I be stuck to you like glue baby

Wanna spend it all on you baby

My room is the g-spot

Call me Mr. Flinstone

I can make your bedrock

I can make your bedrock

I can make your bedrock girl

I can make your bedrock

[Lil Wayne Verse 1]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer

Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia

Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner

You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher

So misunderstood, but what's a World without enigma?

Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers

Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her

Never met the bitch, but I f-ck her like I missed her

Life is the bitch, and death is her sister

Sleep is the cousin, what a f-ckin' family picture

You know father time, we all know mother nature

It's all in the family, but I am of no relation

No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration

Black and white diamonds, f-ck segregation

F-ck that shit, my money up, you n-ggas just Honey Nut

Young Money running shit and you n-ggas just runner-ups

I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doing this shit

Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch



[Lil Wayne Verse 2]

I'm goin' back in

Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded

I think you stand under me if you don't understand me

Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy

But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy

Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest

I beat the beat up, call it self defense

Swear man, I be seeing through these n-ggas like sequins

N-ggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end

Talking to myself because I am my own consultant

Married to the money, f-ck the world, that's adultery

You full of sh-t, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk

Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt

Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt

Mind so sharp, I f-ck around and cut my head off

Real n-gga all day and tomorrow

But these muthaf-ckas talking crazy like they jaw broke

Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya



Try me and run into a wall, outfielder

You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights

The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe

Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do

If these n-ggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon

Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall

I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all

And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on

But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on

Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it

Young Money, Cash Money

Paper chasing, tell that paper, ?Look, I'm right behind ya?

Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna

People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda

Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her

You n-ggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant

I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate

Yeah, with a swag you would kill for

Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder

Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well

Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell



[Cory Gunz]

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean

Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine

Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen

Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend

I played the side for you n-ggas that's tryna front, and see

Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you n-ggas the son of me

Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha

Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda

Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bald like Cuba

And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya

I be mackin', 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover

Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter

N-ggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler

Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler

Wayne, these n-ggas out they mind

I done told these f-ck n-ggas, so many times

That I keep these bucks steady on my mind

Tuck these, I f-ck these on your mind, pause

To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?

Keep throwin' my sign in the middle

Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch

I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad

Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside

I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX n-gga, ya heard?

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love

How to love



For a second you were here

Why you over there?

It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body

Like you never had a love

Never had a love



When you was just a young'un you're looks but so precious

But now your grown up

So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds

Without you being insecure

You never credit yourself so when you got older

It's seems like you came back 10 times over

Now you're sitting here in this damn corner

Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder



See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

How to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love

How to love



For a second you were here

Why you over there?

It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body

Like you never had a love

Had a love



You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions

But it wasn't your fault

Wasn't in your intentions

You the one here talking to me

You don't wanna listen

But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin'

Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping

Baby, so don't be mad

Nobody else trippin

You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook



See You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

How to love

How to love



See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in the corner tryna put it together

How to love

How to love



Oooh,

See I just want you to know

That you deserve the best

You're beautiful

You're beautiful

Yeah



And I want you to know, you're far from the usual

Far from the usual



You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Who else really tryna fuck with Hollywood Cole? I'm with Marley G, bro

Flying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows

And I wanna tell you something that you prolly should know

This that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow

And uh, my real friends never hearin' from me

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me

That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused

I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews

We walk the same path, but got on different shoes

Live in the same building, but we got different views

I got a couple cars I never get to use

Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos

And these days all the girls is down to roll

I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole

Plus I been sippin', so this shit is movin' kinda slow

Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

And I don't bust back, because I shoot first



Meet me on the fresh train

And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X Games

Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change

And I smoke 'til I got chest pains

And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James

Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne

I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin' plane

Skinny pants and some Vans

Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen

As the world spin and dance in my hands

Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand

Uh, wake up and smell the pussy

You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me

I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin' where it took me

Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red

Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg

Ma'fuckin' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade

Ball on automatic start

I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw

Wildcat offense, check the paw prints

We in the building, you niggas in apartments

No-now, c'mon, be my blood donor

Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her

Do it big, and let the small fall under that

Damn, where you stumbled out? From where they make gumbo at

Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack

But you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack

Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga, nothin' short of that

days of the same

you keep the sunshine

save me the rain

I search but never find

hurt but never cry

i work and forever try

but im cursed so never mind

and its worse but better times

seems further and beyond

the top gets higher the more that I climb

the spot gets smaller and I get bigger

tryna get me where I fit in

no room for a n-gga but soon for a n-gga it be on mutherf-cker cause

all this bullsh-t have made me strong, mutherf-cker

just hope your heaven sent and ya hell proof

i'll wake up in the World and cut the lights off

but wisdom is bleak and thats a word from the wise

served to survive, murder and bribed

and when it got too heavy i put my burden aside..

[Eminem]

it hurts but I never show,

this pain you'll never know

if only you can see just how lonely and how cold

and frostbit i've become

my back's against the wall

when push come to shove

i just stand up and scream f-ck em all

man it feels like these walls are closing in, this roof is caving in,

oop its time to raise it then

your days are numbered like pages in my book of rhymes got em cookem boy

this crooked mind of mine got em all shook and scared to look in my eyes,

I stole that f-ckin clock, i took the time and i came up from behind

and pretty much snuck up and butt f-cked this game up

better be careful when you bring my name up f-ck this fame

that aint what i came to claim, but the game aint gonna be the same

on the day that i leave it

I swear one way or another i'ma make these f-ckin haters believe it,

I swear to God wont spear the rod, i'm a man of my word

so your f-ckin heads better nod

im gonna f-ck around in this bitch and roast everybody

sleep on me that pillow is where your head will lie, permanently bitch it's beddy-bye,

this world is my easter egg, yeah, prepare to die'

my head is swoll

my confidence is up

this stage is my pedastal

Niggas is jealous but really I couldn't care less

I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hair net

Devil on my shoulder, the lord as my witness

So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness

What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop

Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful

Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet

I tried to pay attention but attention paid me

Haters can't see me, nose bleed seats

And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap

I rock to the beat of my drumset

I've been at the top for a while and I aint jump yet

But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit

Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

You told me that they can understand the man I am

So why are we here talkin' to each other again



Oh, I see the truth in your lies

I see nobody by your side

But I'm with you when you re all alone

And you correct me when I'm lookin wrong

I see that guilt beneath the shame

I see your soul through your window pain

I see the scars that remain

Lookin at me now I can see my past

Damn I look just like my fuckin dad

Light it up, that's smoke at mirrors

I even look good in the broken mirror

I see my momma smile that's a blessin

I see the change, I see the message

And no message could been any clearer

So I'm stared with the man in the...

I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag

Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting

I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect

Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters

But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper

So love or hate me, I stay hate-free

They say we learn from mistakes, that's why they mistake me

I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers

All hail Weezy, call it bad weather

I stick to the script, I memorize the lines



Life is a movie that I've seen too many times

You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds

And they say never say never, but fuck your nevermind

I've been gone too long

I've been gone too long

Life is a choice, and death is a decision

Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch

I still got the vision like a line between two dots

Young money's eating, the label getting fatter

And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at em

I'm a bad motherfucker, cause the good die young

EVerybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one

Man when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb

Shoot that hummingbird down, Hummingbird don't hum

Big money, big money, deep pockets

Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher

Y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher

I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker

And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her

You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids

But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises

Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?

Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM

Beach bum, call me ocean drive slim

Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin

Belly of the beast till it pukes

Hope it ain't too many feelings involved
I see niggas in this bitch, stuntin', popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches and when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her

Then she let us in, we take all of your shit

And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches

I tell her, ""Get 'em"" she say, ""I got you""

I say, ""No, bitch, I say get 'im""

And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties

And she give us the word, we come through with AKs

It's a stick up, she scream like a victim

Now you feeling so silly

I smoke color purple

I'm up in here feeling like Celie (ooh)

Nappy ass dreads, what's that you say?

Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (ooh)

You can get snaked, you can get faced

I'll buy the bitch that you feeling

'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee

And you telling your business, she tell me your business

You tell that bitch what you're feeling

All of the beans you be spilling

To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillings

She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden

She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit, we'll break in your home

And take the specifics and meanwhile the bitch is on vacation with him so she don't get blamed

We don't snatch chains, we find out addresses

And we don't leave messes

You only know that it's gone when you check it

Then your first thought is to start second guessing

She say, ""What's wrong?""

You say, ""Nothing, keep resting""

She say, ""What's missing?"" ""How you know something missing?""

He scratch his head, she say get back in bed

And she gave him some head

Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say

Ooh, I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', popping bottles

Getting drunk with these bitches and when they leave, they get followed

I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we following

Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, don't be so obvious

Mona Lisa

Long hair, don't care, she handle the business and don't ever tell

She bite the bullet and cough up the shells

She tell 'im, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place""

And if he say, ""Yeah,"" then we meet him there

She feed him lies with his silverware

She don't want love, she just want her share

I, know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his

'Cause she tell him that it is

So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears

And then she tell me, and I be all ears

And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him

And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over

I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""

She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""

We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up

Walk up to the door and right before he knock, she open the door naked

She left it unlocked

They started French kissing so he didn't see moi

And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch

Music up loud with his head in the cloud

Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him

Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown

Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down

You know what it is, put your fucking hands up

Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down

And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her

She a good actress and you a dead actor

You'll be dead after we get what we're after

If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh

I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga

But think for me, nigga

Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga

I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga

She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga

She slip something in it, now thank for me, nigga

Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture

Mo-mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas

Pussy got you out of character, nigga

You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga

Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion

We have you attention and now you're looking down a barrel though, nigga

Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga

We just looking for the casserole, nigga

But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga



Ah, everyday she wake up with a different color make up

And I promise to go take her to the movie and the mall

Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, fourth minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball

Paparazzi looking at them both popping up and take a picture, uh

Probably on a Internet blog

In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her on his mother

Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow

Mona Lisa

Pussy good enough, it got 'em sending into wars

And he digging in it like he living in it

Make a new religion with it

Man a nigga 'bout to go against God

Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird, when she asked him, did he want to make love in a yellow taxi

Never gave two fuck, jumped in the backseat

Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby

Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie

I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing

I'ma call up again like I did last week

Make good with the friend and I'm more jazzy

Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley

Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy

Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me

Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me

'Bout a motherfucking double standard, acting

Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone

But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty

Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone (No)

You fucking with Wayne? (No)

Bitch, gimme your phone

(No, let me take this call real quick)

...lick me like a lollipop

He on your fucking ringtone?

Is that the shit that you do?

Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos

Jump on the internet, watching his interviews

I don't know what the fuck, lately gotten into you

Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder

Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?

The pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma daycare after school

And she never did charge her

You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up

You know what, I get buck, let me go get my gun, I got one in the chamber

I'm plannin' on aimin', God dammit, you know that the damage is done

Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress

I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess

So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killing that pussy I'm killing myself



She say, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

She say, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Now he get the picture Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah"

Extra clip in the stash like a console

Swizzy, you a chef, I like my lunch gross

Just look up, bro, there the stars go

I see the shovel, but where the drugs go? Hmm

To the unknown

Only way he comin' back is through his unborns

It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

And when they snooze we UP

Feet up like a paraplegia

Or paraplegic or parallel park

In that red and yellow thang old skool Atlanta Hawk

Like I'm from Colli Park but I'm from Hollygrove

Now all my bloods scream Su-Woop and Da Da Doe

And I weigh it well on my libria scale

Ch-yeah!

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear

Queen B, as I share mic time, with my heir

Young Carter go farther, go futher, go harder

Is that not why we came?, if not than why bother?

Show no mercy in Murcielaga's

Far from being the bastard that Marcey had fathered

Now my name's being mentioned with the martyrs

The Biggie's and the Pacs the Marleys and the Marcus'

Govi got me a Molotov Cocktail

Flow even if you box well can't stop the blows

Ka-boom the Roc Boy in the room

The dope boy just came off the spoon

Also I'm so fly I'm on auto-pilot

While guys just stare at my wardobe

I see Euro's, that's right plural

I took so much change from this rap game

It's your go



HEY MR. Carter



[Verse 4:]

It's my go

And I'm a go so opposite of soft

Off the richter Hector Camacho Man Randy Savage

Far from average above status quo

Flow so pro I know I rise slow and win I pass

They say ""wat up killer man? "" stop bringing up my past

And next time you mention Pac, Biggie and Jay-Z

Don't forget WEEZY BABY!



[Chorus:]

Hey Mr. Carter (Amen)

Tell me where have you been (yea)

They been asking

They been searchin

They been wondering why (ha ha)

Hey Mr. Carter (Amen)

You can try me fucka but win I squeeze it hurt

At the funeral parlor dripping tears down my sleeve

Balling 'til my hair is as white as Johnny Carson
You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, ""Don't mind the little voices"" (Woah)
What's harder, love or Mr. Carter?
Especially when these hoes ain't right, these hoes ain't loyal

Shit, who's wrong? Who's right? Just ask my lawyer

Right or wrong, I'm still gon' take his advice, he take my orders

I'll be a-okay instead of alright, or kinda sorta

And before I ever take that for granted, I take the charges

See, you can't believe in all of the hype you hear at the barber

If the odds are stacked against us, they're likely to stack 'em on us

Lil Tune, Jurassic in the room, Tyrannosaurus

I ain't steal it, I took it, I ain't crooked, I'm cater-cornered

And if my fruits of labor were ripe, I would have an orchard

But I'm nauseous from my ups and downs and back and forwards

Shit, Mr. Carter, eyes are always on ya

So I smile for the cameras and hide from the reporters

Roll a blunt up in this bitch, when it burn, it start my motor

Shoulder shruggin' 'cause the world on my shoulders, shit

What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?

Tune in this bitch, let's spike the Holy Water

Tryna stay grounded, my flights said no departures

Shit, what's harder, murder or abortion?

Woah, what's harder, death or Mr. Carter?

Is it easier to play deaf or to listen harder?

I'm like, ""Girl, what's harder than life for Mr. Carter?""

Knock on wood but with the wood comes termites and turmoil

Was it easier to change diapers or back to normal?

Times are changing like Father Time just lost his father

What's harder, to ask for sorrow or to borrow?

Or to break hearts or get your heart broke, I don't know



I ask, ""What's harder, jail or Mr. Carter?""

School or Mr. Carter?

The news or Mr. Carter?

Man, what's harder, drugs or Mr. Carter?

Judge or Mr. Carter? Court and order, yeah

What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?

I ride for this shit like a knight in shining armor

I pile up the dope and roll it tight like UnderArmour

Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas

I got homies from the old school and we been lost our diplomas

Got some hoes from California, think they shit smell like begonia's

Got a bone to pick? I pick it 'til your boneless

Like I come from San Antonio, pop up at the spur of the moment

How you want it? When in Hell, I'm a Roman

Head on fire, I'm a comet, heat up out my abdomen

And you know me, man I'm all about my business

Business handle business for me

I know you know life's a bitch, I turned her to a business woman

Mind your business, I'm sayin'

What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?

What's higher, the price or Mr. Carter?

Should I call you Mystery because I'm right here to solve you

And if you start to smell fear or fright , I sprayed it on you

I made it and when I made it, you hate it, I made it on you

You know the streets talk, my nigga, don't made 'em argue

Niggas faded away, I light one and get faded for you

I'm reclinin', Weezy Baby, La-Z-Boy you, they enjoy you

I'm like, ""What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?"""

I just bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
Got too much on my mind, hit the blunt and reflect
When I was under arrest, my bitch was under duress
I bet she fucked while I was gone, then I doubled the bet

I smoke weed in Amsterdam and I smuggle the rest

I act like I'm shakin' your hand and you'll get punched with the left

And you can get killed for shit you said under your breath

And if you do choose to bark, it ain't nothin' to a vet

Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas

Yo bitch about to swallow a bunch of me's, nigga

I got a white girl fuckin', suckin' me, nigga

While I'm thinkin' 'bout the days that it sucked to be niggas



Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech

Nigga, keep your head up like that gun to ya neck

And my bitch was scared to fly 'til we fucked on a jet

Fucked her in the cockpit, all these buttons to press



I just got myself a blonde with the puffiest chest

I just bought myself some time, rolled my Rollie a check

Ridin' in a double R, just regrettin' regret

Getting loaded more than once, no Russian Roulette

I just left King of Diamonds, I just fucked a baguette

I ain't called her since that day, I just wasn't impressed

Ooh, with a nose ring, startin' a bunch of BS

Hide the gun, knock on your door, dressed like UPS

Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas

I'm a bear coughing up a bunch of honeybees, nigga

Got hoes under me, like a submarine, nigga

Got a bitch with a clit like a butter bean, nigga (Uh)



Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech (Yeah)

Bought my sons toys and my daughter a pet

Bought my homeboys choppers and my woman a dress

And to catch me if I fall, I bought my mother a net, let's go



Anyone could get knocked off, any bitch could get knocked up

Baby daddy get locked up, sell everything, put the house up

Don't say anything, keep your mouth shut

Except two words and that's ""how much""

If I do get out, we're skippin' town

She said what about her mama

I paused

I said, ""I gotta do what I gotta

Is you gon' ride with me or you not?""

And she start cryin' and said, ""I'm not""

And I paused

I said, ""It's probably what's best

Well, I'll be back when pigs fly

So they can follow me on my jet""

I tell my pilot where to go next

I bring that problem to your doorstep

I catch you slippin' while you tired

Like the road wet, like it's no sweat

I'm Tunechi, hi, I'm here to collect

They wondering why I ain't gettin' no rest

'Cause that's just too close to arrestin'

And too far from ""serve and protect""

So, Police, read me my wrongs, or just leave me alone

Rubbing, squinting my eyes, I still don't see where I'm wrong

Sold my soul to the streets, they bought it previously-owned

Went to jail for a Glock and soon as I got home



I went and bought myself a 9 and that new MAC-11

You talk shit at 10:59 and make the news at 11:00

Bitch, I'm the wildest motherfucker on a team full of rebels

Young, wild motherfucker to a MILF, cougar, leopard



I'm a lion, motherfucker, to these hoes 'cause you can sweat a little

Euro my secret weapon like Mark, Jackson and Stephen

I see plain clothes, pigs, and unmarked intrepids

My bitch believe what I say, I told her, ""Salt, what's pepper?""

I'm cold as malts and metals, sell stolen parts, whatever

Put three holes in your head like a bowling ball, don't spare 'em

And all my niggas in jail, that's bullshit, I smell ya

Remember Destiny's Child? My favorite one was Farrah, man



Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech

I know you don't want war like you just a cadet

Tell a motherfucker who next, ""Motherfucker, you next""

I'm the best rapper alive and they love me to death, bye

Him and dopeman ain't cool no more
‘Cause dopeman tried to charge him double for the usual
Damn
You just don't hear the news no more
After I tell this story, I gotta kill who I told

Okay, his new package had came in

Had the whole house stankin'

Traphouse doorbell ringin'

Traphouse gettin' too famous

His traphouse poppin' all night

The porch light should be strobe lights

That shit them police don't like

You know them pigs no good like pork rinds

Gotta go home to that whore wife

That don't never wan' fuck, just start fights

And he just made a hard right at the wrong time

They pulled him over, they only write him a ticket, he'll be alright

Yeah, right

‘Cause you know he fit the description of a black male that sell white

AK on the backseat

Trunk full of cocaína

He stepped on the gas and got ghost on 'em

His bitch scream like she seen one

He said, “Shut up while I speed up”

She said, “I think you lost 'em"", now he think he lost 'em

Now he lost his train of thought

The voice in his head said, “All aboard”

And he woke up, don't listen to that bitch

She coked up off of his stuff

And he know it's good

Where the popcorn? This story good, call Hollywood

But anyway, let a nigga get back to it

He came to a neighborhood and he zig-zagged through it

He didn't see the lights, but he still heard the sirens

Cut off all his lights and they drove right by him, woo

Chapter two

Traphouse just got cable

Stuntin' on the neighbors

The cable man was the feds though

A four-year-old was in bed though

He woke up when he heard the Glocks cock

You wouldn't believe what happened ten seconds laters

To be continued, dot, dot, dot



Ten seconds left, he gon' get it

Mag in his mouth, mean like a fitted

Caught him in the pool room, two to his head

In the room and boom, they did it, wow

Face on the ground, Ace of Spade on the ground

Run, bullets, they'll chase you around

Don't listen to me, these niggas ain't playin'

Yo, they'll lace 'em down, feel it

One hit Willy

Other nigga live with a milli

Other nigga ride him Phillies

Run through the hood, all blood on bills on grils

Just chillin' up in New York City

One got witty

Took his mask off, he a dumb ass

Got him on viddy

Somebody yelled out, “Yo, that's 'Chelle”

Blaow, blaow, caught her in the titty, huh

Four more shells went to his face like gazelles

Bloody, they laced him up well

Niggas stop shootin', get the loot

Stop bullshittin', boy, you out, stop playin' yourself

This ain't good, now they fucked

Police barricade the buildin', what?

Now we stuck

Now this clown-ass nigga just fucked us all up (Up)

Eleven more shots

Came to the door was the cops

Chain popped off, caught him in his top

Fell to the floor, damn four-year-old shorty just looked up

Said, “They got you”

Damn, another nigga dead

Another nigga head licked, damn, they copped out

What's it all about, kid?

Max out, shed, play the background, we's out

Mwah



There's always more to the story (To the story)

""Boy, you better watch them hoes when you sleepin'

I got a few Ms put up for safe keepin'

Long hair, don't care like I was raised in a teepee

Nigga, gun hurt, Nina said she 'bout to go streakin'

Niggas 'bout to go to missin', niggas 'bout to go to deacons

Niggas 'bout to get high as airmen from Tuskegee

Niggas blind to the fact 'cause they don't wan' see me

Niggas don't want talk, niggas don't want reason

Niggas don't want peace, niggas don't know the meanin'

Nigga said, ""You're a bitch, nigga,"" bitch European

Nigga ,we Herculean, nigga, skate surf or skiin'

Nigga really overseeing, y'all niggas sight seein'

Tomorrow is what a nigga ain't guaranteein'

New Orleans had a sheriff by the name of Harry Lee

And when he died, niggas shouted out, ""Tha-thank you, Jesus""

Cruising down the street and I ain't Caribbean

Ain't terrified and I ain't never been

Sippin' H-Town, lookin' like Jeremy Lin

I'm movin' slower than a fuckin' Maryland terrapin

I ain't got time, patience very thin

I will fuck a nigga bride on the day she marry him

I'm a bad Samaritan, I'm a black American

Got white like a fuckin' Aryan, and



I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it

I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen

I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga

Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas

I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no



Now beam me up Scotty

You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub

With ""Stop snitchin'"" written on a note by her body

I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny

I wore something simple, she like that about me

My dope from the 90's, my dope ain't consignment

My coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client

These hoes be relying, these niggas be lying

These niggas who snitchin' we throw to the lions

Ain't no testifyin', you know desert's quiet

So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizin'

You cuddle too much, you choose hoes to confide in

I know where you hide and that ho verified it

I told my homie, ""I know where to find him""

He said, ""You late, we already got him

And by the way, it was an honor""

That made my day, made me so proud

I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer

And a Chihuahua

What's the occasion? Don't worry about it

I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba

Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's

Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals

Call me the greatest or call me retired

It's up in the air like carbon monoxide

Bitch, we in the buildin', we started from outside

My dick is my third eye and she call it cockeyed

My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360

She get so wet, it can be sea sickening

Niggas expect some sort of leniency

I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?

I'm Weezy F you, with a sick dick

Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick

Playin' my role, even with a thick script

Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip

Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift

Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip

Anything can happen, put the whats with the ifs

But what's with the ifs?

Just pass that weed like flyin' colors

Light green, teal, turquoise, purple

When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk

I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal

Papa was a rolling stone, worthless

Mama said I wasn't on purpose

That's why I got a ice box where

My heart used to be in this cold world

I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster

I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, Grammies, Oscars

Knock you off your fuckin' high horse

Like a cold-blooded jouster, fightin' for my life

Praying to the ringside announcer

We talked about love and shit
She looked me in my eyes
And then said the next dick she'd take
Would be her husband's dick, damn
See, I had the steak, she had the lobster

I say, ""I want you on my team,"" she say, ""I don't join rosters""

""Oh, believe that,"" and then the drinks came

And then the mood changed and then her answer switched

She let her hair down and lit a cancer stick

She saw it turned me off and said she tryna quit

She went to the ladies room and I hopped on my phone

Most likely she doin' the same thing



Like, ""Girl, what you think?

Um, should I do it?""

She say, ""Shit, I don't know

You know these niggas, he probably used to it""

Her other friend grabbed the phone and said

""That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga

That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga""

And then she say, ""If you do, you better fuck him good

'Cause if another bitch could, she gon' f—""



We had dinner

We talked about the future

She said I could have chose any bitch

I would beg to differ, but beggars can't be choosers, yeah, mmm

And see, I had the shrimp, she had the pasta

She said she don't like rappers, we got something in common

I said, ""Especially that nigga Wayne""

We both laughed and then the wine came

And then her mind changed

She loosened up her blouse, her smirks turn to smiles

It was a full moon when she turned around

She used my restroom, she say, ""You know, girl stuff""

She left the water runnin' and hit her girl up



Like, ""What you think?"" (Haha)

""Should I do it?""

She say, ""Shit, I don't know

We had breakfast, yeah

We fucked all night long and shit

We fell asleep naked, so when we woke up

She wanted that morning dick (I gave it to her too, hmm, yeah)

I had the grits, she had the waffles

She say she drank too much last night and I shoulda stopped her

I say, ""Believe that,"" and then my phone rang

She saw my girl name and then her world changed

She put her clothes on and said, ""I'm going home, Wayne""

I said, ""Lisa, chill,"" and that was the wrong name

She hit her girl up and said, ""I hate rappers""

And then her girl laughed and said, ""Bitch, what happened?""



And she said, ""What you think?

Fuck, why did I do it?

Bitch, I bet that nigga knew he was gon' fuck

From 'Hi, how you doin'?""

And then her friend on the phone say

""Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga

Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga"" (Yeah)

Haters praying for my downfall, at least they're religious
People in Hell, they want rainfall, your bitch just want these digits

I feel like I'm on her payroll how she pay my ass a visit

We put both iPhones on silent, both iPhones on silent

I only answer for my niggas, careful with that dialogue

Man, my house ain't got no house phone

My flip phone is a chip phone

Got a prepaid and that bitch on

But still, I use my bitch phone

'Cause I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust my SIM card

I got Siri talkin' dirty to me, tryna make my dick hard

I got Tunechi on my ringtone, my childrеn on my home screen

I choke you with the phonе charger

Sold more crack than my phone screen, let's go

Fur floor, mask on, bare feet, nigga

100K a week, that's a bad week, nigga

I can sell dogs to a cat freak, nigga

Sell monkey bars to a chimpanzee, nigga

But you never know what you never know

Nigga sell you coke and it wasn't coke

Hang 'em off the building and let 'em go

That's how you make a statement that they should quote

I seen death around the corner

And I lived right by the corner store

I'm a hot boy, I'll burn your hand

I'm a real life Untouchable

I run the show, I run the show

Sell anything but my soul

And I'm prayin' that the only cuffs

That touch my wrist come with button holes, for real

Smokin' on the good

Killin' these hoes like Blair Underwood

Rest in peace to my daddy Rabbit, I swear to his lucky foot

Ever since he died of jealousy, I've been looking for a cure

You see, my daddy had that work, now they watch his son get to it

And just like he ran them streets, I run with bulls

If niggas buyin' I throw out some numbers to 'em

Numbers soundin' yummy to 'em

You need, just call my ho, I gave her phone number to 'em

'Cause you know



I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds

I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds

Pull up in that thing with Stunna, paint it period red

Go tell your boss we can get 'em cheaper than where he paid

I can't trust my iPhone (Nope), .44 on my thighbone (Huh)

You can have the eye of the tiger

I'm the one the tiger better have his eye on, okay

Fussin' with my redbone (Bitch), hang up with my high gone (Why)

Ball 'til I fall, and when I do, them hoes gon' pile on, uh

Assault rifle, now mouth off

Some niggas make it all the way to the top and ball too hard then bounce off

Like my homeboy, let his bitch cook the work and it came out wrong

Almost beat that ho to death, I had to call my plug and vouch for him

'Cause I ain't even got an ounce for 'em

I keep running out on 'em

Everybody gotta eat, just try not to leave the mouse crumbs

.223 right here, this to keep the whole house warm

Then I skate by one of my hoes house, girl, I gotta use your house phone

'Cause she know I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds

I can't trust that Samsung, I think Sam the feds

And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me

Keepin' my two fingers crossed, but I'm still lookin' for peace

I been lookin' at the clouds, maybe they'll listen to me

Can't talk dirty to myself because the mirror's too clean

Tryin' never to look back because the light always green

It's safe to say I lost my way, but I never lost the lead

I really think it's all my daddy fault

I can't find the keys to my heart

Think I'ma need an automatic start

Out there lookin' for love after dark

Then I get tired and it's an afterthought

Where's the love? Five question marks

Eat your heart out, I had to stop

It's the saddest part

I'm questionin' myself, I ain't gotta answer yours

Baby, that's for sure

I take a look at myself and then I just pass the torch

Baby, back and forth

I ask can we get together just to break back apart

Baby, that's the cure

Me, myself, I, my iPhone, Fantastic Four

Never knew 'take it or leave it' could be so literal

Never knew takin' a breather could be so physical

Never knew takin' it easy could be so difficult

Never knew takin' these drugs could be so spiritual

Never knew the chemist like how I know the chemicals

Never knew takin' a life could be so minuscule

Never know takin' chances will be individual

Never know takin' advantage would be inhospitable, how pivotal

Never knew the shit I never knew would be minimal, how cynical

Never knew love and hate were similar, identical



I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me

That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me

And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me

If you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me

When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep



I can't find the keys to this life

Picked the locks, I might be a'ight

Close my eyes, I might see the light

Life is a bitch, she might be my type

Death is a bitch, she might be tonight

Haters kiss and dick-eaters bite

Table turn every day 'n night

Three-sixty, three-sixty-five

I can't find no leaks to my pipe

Police can't find nor reason nor right

Been tryna let shit happen on the fly

But I can't find a seat on that flight

There's a private plane, that's simple and plain

Tickets at a more reasonable price

Sometimes, I don't know how it's gon' end

Even though I done seen the movie twice

Pop a wheelie, new motorbike

Some people like to live a slower life

Some niggas like to live cutthroat

I'ma be the nigga that hold the knife

You girl wan' hold me tight over night

Who am I to tell her wrong from right?

I'ma give her more dick than advice

You give her more strings to a kite

I just found a needle in a haystack, bitch, it's payback

I found myself talkin' to myself with nothin' to say back

And I just found the keys to a Maybach I had way back

Tryna find everything but my way back



Yeah, well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me

When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me

When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

I been lookin' at my possé with a look of belief

I been lookin' my closet and it look like Paris

They been lookin' for your body, they been lookin' for weeks

They find you dead with your eyes open, lookin' for grief



I been lookin' at the clouds, they say they look up to me

Safe to say I lost some sleep, but I never lost my dreams

If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me

When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep

Was just to tell me it's my fault

I let you cry, I let you worry

I let you yell, I let you hurt me

I gave you everything you needed

And now you're gone, gone, gone

Tell me, how you do that to me?



Girl what about me?

I stayed up all night for you

Girl, girl what about me?

I shut down my life for you (I shut down my life)

Now you're worried bout him?

And him, and him, how you do that?

How you act like I never held you every night and now you never call back

Please, girl, girl what about me?

Girl, girl, girl what about me? Me?



Didn't think about me

When I flying OT, I be up in them streets

You tellin' me that you gon' leave

Hittin' my phone with the beep

Knock it out, baby, creep

Oh, cause I just wanna see you smile

Did none of them tears ain't for you, baby

And they ain't matchin' yo style

I'm kickin' it flav with yo sauce

I'm counting them lovers

I'm thinking bout you, and all of the things that we used to do

And all of this you went through

And girl I don't want you with no other dude



Girl what about me?

I stayed up all night for you

Girl, girl what about me?

I shut down my life for you (I shut down my life)

Now you're worried bout him?

And him, and him, how you do that?

How you act like I never held you every night and now you never call back

Please, girl, girl what about me?

In a hundred years, you niggas Gummy Bears

Rest in peace Rabbit

I got the Lamborghini doors up like some bunny ears (Ahh)

Bitch, best not jump in here

Bitch, best not run in here talkin' crazy

Get her walkin' papers

See these married niggas makin' it hard for players

But, see, the hardest players is too hard to play

I give her dick and a couple ultimatums

A cup of bumbu and a cup of coffee later

She do all the drugs, he do all the favors

So we fuck now and we argue later

Dick runnin' like an alternator

I don't separate 'em, I just alternate 'em

I got all the flavors, sit back enjoy the fruit of our labors

You gon' tan that applebottom, it's gon' be orange later

So I fucked the girl, wrote my number down

On the morning paper, set it on the table

Told her, ""I'll be back"" - Schwarzenegger

Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you
Woah!

You’re staring into the clouds

Am I rising or they comin' down

I see death around the corner

And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile

What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?

Nowhere to turn but around and round

Just another nigga that done lost his head

No, a fucking king that forgot his crown

I am not number one, it's true

I'm number 9-27-82

Color blind, even if I may be blue

A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food

But I’m hungry, so hungry

Need my family tree next to a money tree

With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden

With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me

I sip from the fountain of youth

So if I die young, blame the juice

Bury me in New Orleans

Tombstone reads ""Don’t cry, stay tuned""

Bring me back to life

Got to lose a life just to have a life

But if heaven's as good as advertised

I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife

Rest in paradise



Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (why, oh why?)

Won't lie, I fuckin' love you

Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

Won't lie (don't cry, don't cry), I fuckin' love you (don't cry, don't cry)



Talent is God-given, be grateful

Fame is not a given, be humble

And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully

Stay in your own lane, seat buckled

And sometimes when there is no music

We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum

That woman carried the future

And Tunechi was born like ""dun-dun-dun-dun""

Don't call it a comeback

It was dark, now the sun back

Hit me hard, but I punched back

The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap

Is it suicide or it's do or die

It's newer days and it's bluer skies

I told myself ""It's just you and I""

Then the breeze came and it blew my mind

Lord knows who I'm there for

I give my last breath to effort

Mama tell me to be careful

Voice in my head give me an earful

But I got mind control over my control

I lost control but knew I'd find control

I let God control what I cannot control

Can't control the tears, let them drop and roll



Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)

Won't lie (don't cry), I fuckin' love you

(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)

Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)

Won't lie, I fuckin' love you (don't cry)



Don't cry, stay tuned

And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife

Rest in paradise"

This the jungle so have the utmost

We grew up fast, we rolled up slow

We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope

Dreadlock hang down like a bando

Put the green in the bag, like a lawnmower

Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow

Extra clip in the stash like a console

Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Don O

Swizzy, you a chef, I like my lunch gross

Just look up, bro, there the stars go

I see the shovel, but where the drugs go? Hmm

To the unknown

Only way he comin' back is through his unborns

If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord

It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties

And she give us the word, we come through with AKs

It's a stick up, she scream like a victim

Now you feeling so silly

I smoke color purple

I'm up in here feeling like Celie (ooh)

Nappy ass dreads, what's that you say?

Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (ooh)

You can get snaked, you can get faced

I'll buy the bitch that you feeling

'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee

And you telling your business, she tell me your business

You tell that bitch what you're feeling

All of the beans you be spilling

To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillings

She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden

She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit, we'll break in your home

And take the specifics and meanwhile the bitch is on vacation with him so she don't get blamed

We don't snatch chains, we find out addresses

And we don't leave messes

You only know that it's gone when you check it

Then your first thought is to start second guessing

She say, ""What's wrong?""

You say, ""Nothing, keep resting""

She say, ""What's missing?"" ""How you know something missing?""

He scratch his head, she say get back in bed

And she gave him some head

Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say

Ooh, I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', popping bottles

Getting drunk with these bitches and when they leave, they get followed

I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we following

Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, don't be so obvious

Mona Lisa

Long hair, don't care, she handle the business and don't ever tell

She bite the bullet and cough up the shells

She tell 'im, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place""

And if he say, ""Yeah,"" then we meet him there

She feed him lies with his silverware

She don't want love, she just want her share

I, know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his

'Cause she tell him that it is

So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears

And then she tell me, and I be all ears

And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him

And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over

I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""

She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""

We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up

Walk up to the door and right before he knock, she open the door naked

She left it unlocked

They started French kissing so he didn't see moi

And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch

Music up loud with his head in the cloud

Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him

Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown

Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down

You know what it is, put your fucking hands up

Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down

And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her

She a good actress and you a dead actor

You'll be dead after we get what we're after

If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh

I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga

But think for me, nigga

Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga

I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga

She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga

She slip something in it, now thank for me, nigga

Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture

Mo-mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas

Pussy got you out of character, nigga

You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga

Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion

We have you attention and now you're looking down a barrel though, nigga

Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga

We just looking for the casserole, nigga

But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga



Ah, everyday she wake up with a different color make up

And I promise to go take her to the movie and the mall

Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, fourth minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball

Paparazzi looking at them both popping up and take a picture, uh

Probably on a Internet blog

In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her on his mother

Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow

Mona Lisa

Pussy good enough, it got 'em sending into wars

And he digging in it like he living in it

Make a new religion with it

Man a nigga 'bout to go against God

Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird, when she asked him, did he want to make love in a yellow taxi

Never gave two fuck, jumped in the backseat

Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby

Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie

I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing

I'ma call up again like I did last week

Make good with the friend and I'm more jazzy

Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley

Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy

Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me

Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me

'Bout a motherfucking double standard, acting

Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone

But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty

Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone (No)

You fucking with Wayne? (No)

Bitch, gimme your phone

(No, let me take this call real quick)

...lick me like a lollipop

He on your fucking ringtone?

Is that the shit that you do?

Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos

Jump on the internet, watching his interviews

I don't know what the fuck, lately gotten into you

Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder

Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?

The pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma daycare after school

And she never did charge her

You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up

You know what, I get buck, let me go get my gun, I got one in the chamber

I'm plannin' on aimin', God dammit, you know that the damage is done

Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress

I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess

So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killing that pussy I'm killing myself



She say, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

She say, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Now he get the picture Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah"

Those lonely nights when you bout lost it

The only time that you would call

Was just to tell me it's my fault

I let you cry, I let you worry

I gave you everything you needed

And now you're gone, gone, gone

Tell me, how you do that to me?

Hittin' my phone with the beep

Knock it out, baby, creep

Oh, cause I just wanna see you smile

Did none of them tears ain't for you, baby

And they ain't matchin' yo style

I'm kickin' it flav with yo sauce

Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, dear life shit

So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it

I just hope I die for a reason

They probably won't miss me ’til they need me

Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord

I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit

Goodbye letter, dear life shit

Way too concerned to be conceited

I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord

Die tryna reach 'em

They care more about how much I leave 'em

Where’d I leave it?

I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids

To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord

Just got off the phone with my son

Told him, ""You a son of a gun""

Just got off the phone with my daughter

Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord

A few bitches left me

And only got a new bitch elected

My old bitch was too disrespectful

And only give my new bitch respect

That's power, yes

So now we’re next

Can't lie though, I tried though

I'll die tryin', that’s a common death

We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams

Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath

Now they try to tell me I need rest

And I'l find love again, I ain't find it yet

Oh, but I guess it is what it is

As it appears, oh shit

The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit

And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird

He done died so many times but still here

Why am I here? Here

Life

What is my meaning? My reason?

Naked bitches really love ones

Sometimes our loved ones don't love us

I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love

Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber

I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""

Even though I make it look easy

But understand looks are deceiving

Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance

'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it

Crank it 'bout it, gotta drink about it

Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it

Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'

Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me

Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'

I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die

Can't deny it, you can't take my lion

I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string

I can't describe it

Feel like a anchor tied to my finger

Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink

I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas

There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength

I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga

So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink

It's way too real

The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real

I hope it gave you chills

The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill

You don't know how dead you feel until you're dead for real

Gettin' high after I paid the bill

Lower than a Navy SEAL

Show up with them Navy guns

I hope somebody prayin' for 'em

Price tag, no mistake, somebody payin' for 'em

Ice baths, when my face numb, no expression

What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?

Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive. Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive""

I don't get too high to look over blessings

Never come in second, make the most of your seconds

They so precious

'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it

If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling

I keep it real, niggas better keep it copasetic

Where the weed at? I'm gettin' a sober headache

Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better

I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter



Dear life

What is my meaning? My reason?

That's the question

I ask the reader

God bless the reader

Dear life

What is my meaning? My reason?

That's the question



You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that"

Can't talk to myself 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers

Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener

And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle

I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina

Never question myself unless I ask am I dreamin'

The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas

Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's

They told me time would tell

I told time to kiss my ass and I heard can you look this way?

Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers

I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish

Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on

Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android

Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet

Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head bad hair day

In broad day light let's play, lil' kids playin' jump rope

Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show

Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose

I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns

All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone

Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song

In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm

Rum-bum-bum-bum-bum if they come for 'em, I tell 'em



God took his time when he made me

Got my pride to the side, off safety

On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef

'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Momma said God took his time when he made me

'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?

Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras

Extra ready for my presents, extra sexy but she selfish

Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelmin'

Talkin' money over salmon in Italian in Australia

Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just value when the value

Wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like, ""Ma, hell yeah""

I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

Devil lies jumpin' at ya, comin' from what's comin' at ya

I come from where they come at ya, in a way you can't come back from

I attack from every crack, while you been chillin', I been active

I been still inside the action, you been actin' I been buildin'

You been blabbin', you been bickerin'

I been black and I been sippin' like the Dracula

I been feelin' like Galactus

Got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry

If you don't know that I'm the answer, you should kill who you been askin'



Momma said God took his time when he made me

I put my pride to the side, off safety

I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef

'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Momma said God took his time when he made me

I see no cracks in me, though

Everything stop like start to twirl

Thank God, Weezy back, order is restored, all is right with the world

Last time, because we lost time

No free time, till I bought time

No tee time, no off time

No me time, on y'all time

Blessins', showers from the north side

From the brightest flower out the darkest skies

Love is blind, but we caught eyes

It's a bumpy road, but a joyride

Still, can't ignore my rappin' tight

Like my hunger sharp, but [?]

Still the mothafuckin' best rapper, A-live

Let me set my alarm

You say don't sweat your alarm

And now the pressure is on

So now there's sweat in my palm

But her reception ain't warm

So my deception preforms

And then that silence is awkward

Like am I deaf or alone

I got a jet in the morn'

And she upset and I'm calm

And when a women in scarring

Is when welcome is worn

Now her temperature is showing

And I just weathered her storm

And she expect me to stay

I be like ""Let go my arm!""

Willies jumping off your ass like they shock absorbing

Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded



I used to smoke to get high now I smoke to get vibes

I used to tote the semis, I still tote the semi

Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the beast side

I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies

If he dies, he dies

If he dies, he dies

If he dies, he dies

But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes

Young Mulah baby

Was that a accident or did he... or was he playing with the gun

So I never really found out about what...

Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah

I'm in this bitch

Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch

But now I’m in this bitch

Yeah, I'm in this bitch

Tunechi you a genius

Looked in the mirror said

""Don't let the money come between us""

I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience

But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers

I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers

Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color

And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder

The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble

Real shit, look at my candle, still lit

Had to swallow my pride, though, swag tastes like spearmint

Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em

I never turn my back on ’em

Cold nigga act like they cool with ya

But a lot of these niggas be transformers

A lot of these players be bench-warmers

The game ain’t easy, but it's fair, nigga

I’mma sit in this throne so long

'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga

Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga

Said, ""Relax, tell him baby don't stress out""

But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though

She said, ""Let that shit work itself out""

""Let that shit work itself out""



C5

Yeah, back in this bitch

Tune you left this bitch

Like you knew this bitch was gon’ let your ass back in this bitch

""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

But nobody else like you in this bitch

""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

""Let it all work out""

Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch



Cita you a psychic

'Cause you said there be days like this

They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices

Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers

Real shit, put some niggas on that guilt trip

It'll be on in a heartbeat

You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip

I fear God, never fear men

Give back, never give in

V.I.'s never be women

Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it

Reach highs, never reach limits

Need minds, I don't need clinics

This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz

When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight

I almost asked her to creep with me

But I was young, and I held my tongue

But with that tongue, I just keep spitting

So it all worked out



And now I'm in this bitch

And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""

I never change, you know I been this bitch

And then she said, ""Let it all work out""

""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)

""Let it all work out, let it all work out""



Tunechi, you a monster

Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya

I'm lookin' for that big old smile, full of diamonds

Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'

It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""

I tried, comprising and went kamikaze

I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it

I cry, put it to my head and thought about it

Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie

Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered

Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it

Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding

I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me

It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying

God came to my side and we talked about it

He sold me another life and he made a prophet



Yeah, and he said

""Let it all work out"" (yeah)

""Let it all work out""

(I'm still in this bitch)

""Let it all work out""

(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)

""Let it all work out""

Let it all work out (phew)

""Let it all work out""

(But he said, ""Remember this:"")

""Let it all work out""

""Let it all work out""

(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")

""Let it all work out"" (yeah)

""Let it all work out""

(And don't forget what I did this, bitch)

""Let it all work out""

(Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch"")

""Let it all—""

""Let it all work out"" (yeah)

""Let it all work out""

(Now I'm out this bitch)

""Let it all work out""

(I'm out this bitch)

""Let it all—""

(And it all worked out)

""Love you, Dwayne"""

Two V8s, ain't no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti

Bitch, I’m bad, I'm worse, I'll pass the purp

Don't fuck with me 'cause right now, I'm higher than Captain Kirk

I swear, I be the sickest nigga, you can ask the nurse

And if you throw it in a bag I bet I'll snatch her purse

OK, I spaz, I curse; you last, I'm first

I'm on your ass, like dirt; behind that cash, get murked

I'm talking big shit, nigga, join my hit list, nigga

What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss, nigga

Shoot the witness, nigga

Hold court in the streets and convict this nigga

Ol' dickless nigga

Man, I'm running with the blocka, Young Money, motherfucker

You think we gon' do our thing? Well, ain't it sunny in the summer?

And we coming for the commas, and whoever among us

And you know I'ma bust my ass until my crew very humongous

I said, T.I., hold your head, and Mack, hold your head

Wish I could but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds

And to my Bloods, code red, man, you know how we play it

And if it costs to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay

I—I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit

Take the brain off the whip; now, it don't make no sense

Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promised tomorrow

Now, women kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra

Fuq' roll them killer plants, the Little Shop of Horror

And we roll them bitches thick, make 'em look like Tocrra

Man, I'm too much for these niggas and three much for these hoes

The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed

I love my baby mamas, they get my highest honor

Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama

And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard

I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard

Quarterback, shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards

Bitch, I ball hard, breaking all the backboards

Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours

And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors

Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall

Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdy these balls

In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls

Man, I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls

Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls

Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws

My flow is like rubbing two logs

Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers, ugh

Now, get off my dick, I ain't fucking with you

Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol

Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston

Redbone do me good, then her friend assist her

I mean, a bitch she never met, her best friend, or sister

I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista

Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho

Bullet in you boys' memory, now you act like you don't know

Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store

Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove

Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago

But Heaven or Hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'ma go

Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show

Still ""long hair, don't care"" like a Navajo

I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search

I smash this verse, and I swag and surf

I bring it to your front door like you ordered me
Back in this bitch, but a lot more rich
On my Papa Bear shit, need hot porridge

Got a lot more shit than you can ever fathom

A big-head nigga couldn’t even imagine

The shit I do, most doers never done

I'ma fuck this beat, you bitch, ooh, you better cum

Bet I run this shit, I don't run from shit

I still b—beat your ass like a fucking drumstick

Weezy Fucking Baby, baby, make the ladies come quick

The money can’t fit in my pockets, but I bet that gun fit

And I’m so unfit 'cause all I eat is rappers

And these rappers ain't shit, I like my fast food faster

Syrup got me slow like a turtle 'round this ho

And I'm flyer than the highest-flying bird around this ho

What's the word around this ho? You get served around this ho

Yeah, you get served like a fucking hors d'œuvre around this ho

I don’t splurge around no ho, no, I don’t shine in front of no bitch

'Cause after she get off my dick, I be like ""Find the front door, bitch""

I don't know why in the fuck your bitch keep coming by

I done fucked your bitch a hundred times

What the fuck your bitch got on her mind? My fucking dick

I call her ""dickhead,"" spicy like a Big Red

Strike you like a Bic head—your flow sick? My shit dead

Man, I'd rather chill with 54 bitches

Ch—Chill like— Ch—Chill like an Eskimo

L—Let's get more— Let's get more bitches

And I be like, ""Let's get more bitches""

Mr. Officer, stop arresting your bitches

Stop letting the messy hoes mess with your business

Mickey Mouse cheese, hip-hop Walt Disney

Sheesh, gosh, Oshkosh B’gosh

Smoking on that Bob Marley, listening to Pete Tosh

I—I—I do me; no, I do three

At a T... I-M-E

Why, when we say we Young Mula

The bitches leave y'all and relay-run to us

And payday comes sooner than later 'round here

And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here

Hey, you better stop the hate around there

Before Tommy, Mac, and Nina debate around there, yeah

You see it in my face, I don’t care

Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there

I'm the best thing yet, I know I got that thing wet

Everybody wan' be fly but don’t know where their wings at

Huh, had to pause for a minute

Now, I'm right back in it, like the drawers of the women

On a scale of one to ten'n, my girl be a twenty

My girl so bad, make a nigga think he sinning

My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me

Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me

Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies

All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E

Mic check, two-three; I'mm different like blue pee

And my girls be half naked like Betty Boop be

Like a hoopty, man, the boy been riding

And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid

You think I'm stunting, but no, I'm just surviving

And I been here, but my soul is just arriving

Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin

No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribing

Medication free, and for meditation, we

Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see

S-H-A-R-P as a tack, hotter than

Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been

Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying

I can do whatever if I'm planning that

So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack

And we cook the hard, cut the soft, and bring the whammys back

Mafi-o, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?

Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back

All up in another nigga woman, I be ramming that

Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate

Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it

And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these evangelists

I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami, though

I act so New Orl-e-ans, yes, I go pistachios

That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me

And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me

I want to be the best
I want to be the best that ever played
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win

That's what drives me



[NBA analyst talking]



He's the best player in the game

It's just that simple

There's nothing Kobe Bryant can't do

He will defend your best player

He will shoot from the perimeter

He will get all in yo mug

He will do whatever it takes

He is the most complete basketball player

In the game today - bar none

He has an assassins mentality

I said this once, I said this when the trade went down

And I will repeat it again

Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship

More than Kobe Bryant? There is no one

This guy is Hollywood



What separates Kobe from the pack?

More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one





[Lil Wayne]



OK

Kobe doin work

24 (two-four) on my shirt

He the greatest on the court

And I'm the greatest on the verse

Going for the 4th ring like it was his first

Gotta get the bling

Do it for Kareem!

24 (two-four) so nice, my flow so mean

Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldestein

Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings,

Kobe in the game dunking on your team

Black Mamba, attack conquer

Basketball beast, rap monster

Crossover good, a turnaround jumper

Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers

You know where it's going, it's going down yo

This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though

I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show





[??? Talking]



I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words

I mean, he's amazing





[Lil Wayne]



Pass me the damn ball

I don't need a pick at all

and don't worry bout my shot

Cus I'ma get that off

Yea, I drops 40 on your double team

Then I drop 81 on another team

Yeah, you better guard me with caution

And watch me work em like an auction

No such thing as exhaustion

No time for resting

Cus I don't take breaks

I just break records

And I prefer the ball with 3 seconds

And I be legal with it all in 3 seconds

Ya dig? That is a guarantee

Apparently

And please tell your defense

Don't ever man to man with me

Double team, triple team

Your defenders sick of me

But, I never let em get to me

Literally

Step back and give em a three

Ain't no defending me





[Reporter talking]



One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately

LeBron James



[LeBron James talking]



I've been recorded saying that

He's definitely the best player in our League

Um, to me, in my eyes

The best scorer in our League

And there's not another guy in our League

That can accomplish some of the things

that he's doing





[Lil Wayne]



Never take a day off

Catch you at the top of the J

and get a J off

Baseline facetime

Tongue out like 23 (two-three)

Even 23 (two-three) gotta love how I do me

Practice while you sleep

Practice in my sleep

Straight outta the hospital

Practice ain't for me

I will be jumping over you

Like i got a mattress at my feet

And all the Phil Jackson teams

Better be passing it to me

I put the master in the beast

Attack you like a beast

I am starving for victory

And that means I repeat

And when they ask you who's the best

Then the answer should be me





[Elie Seckbach talking with Mikael Pietrus]



Reporter: Who's the best player in the NBA?

Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant.

Reporter: Really? Why?

Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get





[Lil Wayne]



Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. automatic

I can post em up, ????? attic

I'm going for the ring

I'm going for the ring

I went to Beijing

And came back with the bling

Who they want? They want Kobe

And what he want? He want the trophy

The victory

and the glory

No Shaq

No Robert Horry

Now break em off, Kobe break em off

You better be ?????

Yea, just give him the ball and he take it off

Or he properly dishing it to Gasol

Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah

Or just let Ariza do his thing, yeah

Cus I'm great, and so is my team, yeah



[I thought you want to be the greatest]



Do it for Magic

It's your time baby

I see nothing wrong with doing it 4 times baby

I'm the best yes

And he the best yeah

Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year

Now whats defense

To an assassin

Killer instincts

Murder the basket

Then steal the ball back

Hold it for ransom

It's more than a game

This is a passion

Been an All-Star, been a Champion

Free throw line, you hear them chanting

MVP MVP

Kobe Bryant aka Envy Me

?????

Whoever he is he cant guard me

He cant guard me





[Elie Seckbach]



So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was - Kobe Bryant

Whoever did it was a very smart women or man

Cause I'm coming like the stomp of every marching band

I need y'all to arch your hands and pray for me

I need...



[Chorus]

Help!, Help!

Help, I need somebody

Help, not just anybody

Help, you know I need someone

Help!, Help!

Help, I need somebody

Help, not just anybody

Help, you know I need someone

Help!, Help!"

Closed casket as usual
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
The quietest things in musicals
Kumbaya is beautiful
I bust in with that uzi though

And they look like they saw Lucifer

Welcome to the funeral

We not welcome, we intruded though

You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke

Thats just inexcusable

Welcome to the funeral, where we from we ruin them

Been to quite a few of them

The reverend talk, we boo'in him

We throw up the Piru at them

Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual

Soul snatching as usual

Amen, hallelujah though

Whole family delusional

Niggas crying like two year olds

Bullet holes come through the doors

I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose

Damn, welcome to your funeral

Everybody knew you bro

Ain't nobody shooting though

Gotta die to see who you know

Damn welcome to the funeral

Where we from we ruin them

The preacher preach we shooting them

Now we need one for you and him

That's why they should cremate ya

Hope when you die they commemorate you

Life is a movie and it's in theaters

Some of y'alls already went to cable

These shots from a far you could get a facial

Black gun chrome gun, interracial

Weed so strong, need ventilation

Funeral home need renovation

I got your mom's teary eyed, that's precipitation

Nigga when you died, did your bitch a favor

Nigga we gonna mob like the Genovese's

Nigga, fat mob, I'ma Jenny Craig 'em

Drive bys in a winnebago

Snipers never hear the baby, crib a cradle of tomatoes on your head

I split tomatoes from 100 feet away, now it's a halo

Thats tomato sauce, Heinz 57

Catch a nigga, you behind, where I left you

I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins, uncles, aunts, and your nephews

Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket

Look his pretty kids in the face, poor bastard

Tears running down a bitch face, romantic

Two straps, I'm up at the Oboe Jacksons

In his face, closed casket

Send him on the highway to heaven no traffic

My lil nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic

He cried tears of joy, then he got him tatted

Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual

Whole family delusional

Amen hallelujah though

Choir singing musicals, Kumbaya, it's beautiful

I bust in with the uzi though

They look like they saw Lucifer

Yeah, welcome to the funeral everybody knew your bro

Ain't nobody shoot him though

Thats just inexcusable

Welcome to the funeral

Where we from we ruin them

Been to quite a few of them

A nigga got immune of them

Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket

Huh, huh, bop

Look his pretty kids in the face, poor bastards

Goddamn, drive bys in a winnebago

Snipers never hear the baby, crib a cradle of tomatoes on your head

I split tomatoes from 100 feet away, now it's a halo



In other words, a nigga did"

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash board
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward
I'm racin' NASCAR, transport, just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer

Now who them Xans for?

I'll pop dance for muscle relaxation

I'm a patient, pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racin'

Yeah I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out, oh you faded?

I faded out, oh you make it? I made it out

But you shady like 8 Mile

8 Ball from Orange, my letdown, I lay it down

Like an eagle, she spread it out

Air it out, yeah I ate it out

I'm a Libra, I weigh it out

Hope the reaper don't take me out

I'm too eager to wait it out, stuck the heater in Satan's mouth

Pray police don't raid the house, pay my taxes and baby moms ain't no cappin'

Don't play around, hate me back and then hate me now

In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste

I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space

Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today

I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe

Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shake

And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up

I stunt when I rolled up, with a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up

You know what's in my soda

And your trap house closin', your glass house broken

And my mad house open and my lighthouse glowin'



Mahogany dashboard, do the dash board

Mahogany dashboard, do the dash board

Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand boy

Brains all over my mahogany dashboard



Mahogany dashboard, I do the dashboard

I think in my backyard, I need an airport

Mahogany sand boy, I start a sand storm

Mahogany skin touch me I cut your hands off

Mahogany door handle, to match the floor panel

Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandles

Mahogany dash slime, I might do the dash slime

Sniffed the coke on the glass slime, she started flat linin'

Good times no hard times, uh oh, it's that time

We at war, I check my Chapal for the exact time

Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' bad vibes

Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire

Plug what the fuck on a rabbi, no cap slime

Judge gave me time I did that time like nap time

Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it

I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'

Under the skudder these bright mahogany dreads showin'

Let's get in bed and break these mahogany head boards

Whoa, mahogany, whoa



Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash board

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash board

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash board

Yeah, I do the dashboard

Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand boy

Brains all over my mahogany dashboard



Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys

Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys

Soon as we land, on mahogany sand

Mahogany sand

Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys

Soon as we land, on mahogany sand

I'm about to find a good plumber
Y'all lil' niggas is some foot soldiers, I'm a foot fungus
You dead brother

I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button

I'm gon' headbutt you like ""Bang, bang, bang, bang""

'Til your heart stop drummin'

I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer

But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off

This bitch sound like hard cough

I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts

Cut the hog head and the tail off

I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on

And once it wear off, then bitch don't touch me like a airball

Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9""

But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in that lace line, that plate mine

Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime

I don't FaceTime with my new thang

New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga

Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind

But I still see in the dark nigga

Dark nigga, Akon

I'm on my shit like maggots

And they then they grow and they fly

Got real bitches with fake asses

With real views and fake eyes

It's stupid, I'm stupid

I'm out of my coofin, narcotic abuser

No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'

Your partners is poodles

Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless

Titty-fuck your baby mama

She breastfeed your child while I do it, I'm stupid



Your crocodile's toothless

Titty-fuck your baby mama

She breastfeed your child while I do it, I looped it

Uh, I'm out of my Tunechi, I'm mindin' my Tunechi

I'm shinin' my Uzi

They find 'em, I lose 'em, I'm hidin' out

Hopin' I don't smell like all these fuckin' vaginas I'm douchin'

Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry

I'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive

Designers, excuse me, massagers masseuse me

Oops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey

Turn you and lil' mami, to tuna salami

You pukin', she vomit, that's beautiful science

That's Tune in a Masi', that's you in a Hyunsi

You stupid or drowsy? I pew in the 'Gatti

Pew, pew and I got 'em, pew, pew and I got 'em

Lil' Tunechi a shotta

Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta

Turn a nigga noodle to nada

Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie

This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it

I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses

Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait

Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew

And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait

My money look Arabic, big blunt lookin' Cuban

My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait

She European and she from Aruba, she from the States

Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we over eight

We throw them B's up high as the moon, soon hit space

I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes

Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way

Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day

Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face

And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face

I cannonballed her face

Fuck her to some Diana Rossin' fake

Damn, I lost the faith

Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case

You can't avoid the Drac'

Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today

Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate

Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way

Now pass the phone to bae

I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave

He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave

I'm ashin' on his head

He ain't got no credit and his Apple card is dead

What's in your wallet?

Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward
I'm racin' NASCAR, transport, just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer

Now who them Xans for?

I'll pop dance for muscle relaxation

I'm a patient, pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racin'

Yeah I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out, oh you faded?

I faded out, oh you make it? I made it out

But you shady like 8 Mile

8 Ball from Orange, my letdown, I lay it down

Like an eagle, she spread it out

Air it out, yeah I ate it out

I'm a Libra, I weigh it out

Hope the reaper don't take me out

I'm too eager to wait it out, stuck the heater in Satan's mouth

Pray police don't raid the house, pay my taxes and baby moms ain't no cappin'

Don't play around, hate me back and then hate me now

In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste

I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space

Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today

I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe

Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shake

And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up

I stunt when I rolled up, with a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up

You know what's in my soda

And your trap house closin', your glass house broken

And my mad house open and my lighthouse glowin'



Mahogany dashboard, do the dash board

Mahogany dashboard, do the dash board

Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand boy

Brains all over my mahogany dashboard



Mahogany dashboard, I do the dashboard

I think in my backyard, I need an airport

Mahogany sand boy, I start a sand storm

Mahogany skin touch me I cut your hands off

Mahogany door handle, to match the floor panel

Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandles

Mahogany dash slime, I might do the dash slime

Sniffed the coke on the glass slime, she started flat linin'

Good times no hard times, uh oh, it's that time

We at war, I check my Chapal for the exact time

Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' bad vibes

Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire

Plug what the fuck on a rabbi, no cap slime

Judge gave me time I did that time like nap time

Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it

I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'

Under the skudder these bright mahogany dreads showin'

Let's get in bed and break these mahogany head boards

Whoa, mahogany, whoa



Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash board

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash board

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash board

Yeah, I do the dashboard

Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand boy

Got real bitches with fake asses

With real views and fake eyes

I'm out of my coofin, narcotic abuser

No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'

Your partners is poodles

Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless

Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry

I'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive

Designers, excuse me, massagers masseuse me

Lil' Tunechi a shotta

Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta

Turn a nigga noodle to nada

Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie

This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it

I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses

Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait

Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew

And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait

My money look Arabic, big blunt lookin' Cuban

My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait

She European and she from Aruba, she from the States

Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we over eight

We throw them B's up high as the moon, soon hit space

I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes

Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way

Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day

Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face

And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face

I cannonballed her face

Fuck her to some Diana Rossin' fake

Damn, I lost the faith

Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case

You can't avoid the Drac'

Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today

Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate

Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way

Now pass the phone to bae

I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave

Shooters, they shoot like Türkoğlu

Murder you, then bury you

Dig a hole and throw dirt at you

You disappear like abracadabra

Magic like 32

It is my time, and, when it is, you on timeout

I'm on Cloud 9, and, nigga, you just on iCloud

I'm an icon, I shine and burn your eyes out

You on the sideline, my side bitch got a side bitch

Gotta sip slow 'case I die quick, I'm alive, bitch

Born piss poor, I'ma die rich full of my shit

Bust up in your house on some mob shit, leave no hostage

Leave you lookin' like January 2nd, July 5th

Y'all are witnesses to my battle, I shall fight

Been through a whole lotta bullshit, still smell nice

Poverty to penitentiary, straight to paradise

Ima jalapeno boy, hot as cayenne pepper

Im tougher than leather, Im smoother than suede 

Always never broke cause Im usually paid 

Got the Rover with the cage kinda brown off beige 

Everybody look at me like I'm ridin on stage 



Got a woman name Sage, she twice my age 

Everytime she hit me up she send her picture with her page 

I aint tryna fall in love, I aint tryna get engaged 

You can meet me at the alter when a nigga really ""dead"" 

Everytime Im tryna leave she beggin me to stay 

And I politely fade away like my name was M.J. 

Then she wrote me a note, guess what that note say 

Well I hope you still like me but I got both ways 

And then I said O then I said ok 

""Stabbed em up and got the fuck"" like my name was O.J 



If ya lookin for some money bitch my name is No Way 

Not tomorrow, not today, not yesterday 

Im Mr. President as they say and that Phantom fits me like its tailor made

If ya lookin for some money bitch my name is No Way

[VERSE 2:]

Last week I met a bitch but I forgot her name 

Short, sweet, red, cute ol vibrant thang 

She got a earring in her pussy and everywhere else 

She say she jog everyday so she could cum on herself 

Then she tell me my love is the best she's felt 

Then she suck my dick like its about to melt 

She drink vitamin water say its good for her health 

She can wrap my whole dick around her waist like a belt 



Then here's anotha bitch, her name was Aisha 

She ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza 

One time it was so good I told her order one more 

She said, its not dominos its dijornos 



Here's anotha bitch I met her at the gong show 

Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show 

She do my dishes wash my clothes and fix my corn rolls 

She do my diches wash my clothes and fix my corn rolls 



I cant forget about my bitch name ""E.T"" Boo 

She's a young project bitch I use to bring the hoe to school 

So I brung the hoe to school, we standin on the yard 

A bitch asked me was I from the 17th ward 

Niggas came up out the cut and started muggin me up 

I grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck 

Then I told my ol lady Ill be back ya see, and hit me on my cell phone if niggas lookin fa me 



[CHORUS]

Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, lost city of New Orleans... we call him this
(Georgia x 8 with Wayne)

Noooowww

This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit

Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue

So called beef wit you know who

Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops

Look at the bullshit we been through

Had the niggas sittin on top they roofs

Hurricane Katrina, we shoulda called it Hurricane (Geeoorrggiaa) Bush

Then they tellin y'all lies on the news

The white people smiling like everythin cool

But I know people that died in that pool

I know people that died in them schools

Now what is the survivor to do?

Got to no trailer, you gotta move

Now it's on to Texas and to (Geeoorrggiiaa)

They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see

But they don't let you know what's really goin on

Make it look like a lotta stealin goin on

Boy them cops is killas in my home

Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street

I ain't no thief, I'm just tryin to eat

Man fuck the police and president (Geeoorrrggiiaa) Bush

So what happened to the leverage, why wasn't they steady

Why wasn't they able to control this?

I know some fok' that live by the lever

that keep on tellin me they heard this, stole this

Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy

1965, I ain't too young to know this

That was President Johnson now

but it's president (Geeoorrggiiaa) Bush



[Chorus - 2X]

We from a town where (Georgia)

Everybody drowned, and

Everybody died, but baby I'm still prayin wich ya

Everybody cryin but (Georgia)

Aint nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush



Noooowwww

I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map

New Orleans baby, now the white house hatin, tryin to wash away like we not on the map

Wait, have you heard the latest, they sayin you gotta have paper if you tryin to come back

Niggas thinkin it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Geeoorrggiaa)

Noooww it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say dont worry bout it

And the children have been scarred, no ones here to care bout em

And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out

Yea we like it they callin y'all, but fuck president (Geeoorrggiaa) Bush

We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is

A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him

And no he ain't gonna drop no dollas, but he do drop bombs

R.I.P. Tay cuz he died in the storm, fuck president (Geeoorrggiiaa) Bush

See us in ya city man, give us a pound

Cuz if a nigga still movin then he holdin it down

I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tch-es

I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yea!



[Chorus]



(DJ Drama: oh yea, you thought we was done? Naw)



YEA!

Money money money get a dollar and a dick

Weezy Baby that crack, muthafucka get a fix

Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich

Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist YES

Yep, I'm a muthafuckin trip

I'ma trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit

Nine hundred to a grand, get you twenty eight grams

If you talkin bout bricks, I'm the interstate man

And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing

Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed-spring

Walkin a thin line, gotta defend mine

And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM

Young toon, yea that's what my people call me

Fifty thousand for the cause, tryin keep the reaper off me

I drink a lotta syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walkin

Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea

Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip

And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly

Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties

Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be da target

Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded

We done lost everythin and you lookin like a bargain

Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant

I'm the best rapper in the game no argin (arguing)



And I don't ever write, pause

Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin

Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in

Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in

All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet

They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin

Mike Jordan, pardon my swag

Even my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family

We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami

I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me

Any rapper wan get at me, tell ya label contact me

Half four hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya

I'm a beast, I'm a preacher, I'm the son of miss cita

Mom dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason

Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even

There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her

Got a topic of this evenin, hotter than a tub steamin

Gotcha girlfriend dreamin of one day bein Trina

Notta sim seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer

Got a white girl drivin, couldn't do it much cleaner

I'm fly in the sky like that muthafuckin ribbon

Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin

Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do

Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks

And bring me that Patrone, I don't play

No ice I like my drink straight, not gay

And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid

I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed

I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs

Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days

Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov

Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old

And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove

Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed

Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hos

Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos

Price sizin for a show and the flow

So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe

Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve

If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse



(Thanks to DerK for these lyrics)"

You take care of me and my son and your brother, we never wanted for nothing

Mama love you

Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you
Woah!

You’re staring into the clouds

Am I rising or they comin' down

I see death around the corner

And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile

What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?

Nowhere to turn but around and round

Just another nigga that done lost his head

No, a fucking king that forgot his crown

I am not number one, it's true

I'm number 9-27-82

Color blind, even if I may be blue

A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food

But I’m hungry, so hungry

Need my family tree next to a money tree

With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden

With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me

I sip from the fountain of youth

So if I die young, blame the juice

Bury me in New Orleans

Tombstone reads ""Don’t cry, stay tuned""

Bring me back to life

Got to lose a life just to have a life

But if heaven's as good as advertised

I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife

Rest in paradise



Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (why, oh why?)

Won't lie, I fuckin' love you

Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

Won't lie (don't cry, don't cry), I fuckin' love you (don't cry, don't cry)



Talent is God-given, be grateful

Fame is not a given, be humble

And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully

Stay in your own lane, seat buckled

And sometimes when there is no music

We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum

That woman carried the future

And Tunechi was born like ""dun-dun-dun-dun""

Don't call it a comeback

It was dark, now the sun back

Hit me hard, but I punched back

The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap

Is it suicide or it's do or die

It's newer days and it's bluer skies

I told myself ""It's just you and I""

Then the breeze came and it blew my mind

Lord knows who I'm there for

I give my last breath to effort

Mama tell me to be careful

Voice in my head give me an earful

But I got mind control over my control

I lost control but knew I'd find control

I let God control what I cannot control

Can't control the tears, let them drop and roll



Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)

Won't lie (don't cry), I fuckin' love you

(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)

Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)

Won't lie, I fuckin' love you (don't cry)



Don't cry, stay tuned

And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife

Rest in paradise"

Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke

At your front door with a gun stowed

""Knock-knock, who's there"" is how it won't go

This the jungle so have the utmost

For the nutzos, and we nuts, so

What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro

We grew up fast, we rolled up slow

We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope

Dreadlock hang down like a bando

Put the green in the bag, like a lawnmower

Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow

Extra clip in the stash like a console

Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Don O

What the fuck bro? Where the love go?

Swizzy, you a chef, I like my lunch gross

Just look up, bro, there the stars go

I see the shovel, but where the drugs go? Hmm

To the unknown

Only way he comin' back is through his unborns

If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord

It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?



What the fuck though? Where the love go?

Five, four, three, two, I let one go

Bow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro

Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

What the fuck though? Where the love go?

Five, four, three, two, I let one go

Bow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro

Aimin' at your head like a buffalo"

Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers

But take her for a walk on the moon as she wear her slippers

The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it

The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker

We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma

High above the ground but I'm under her charisma

Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system

The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipses eclipsin’

My astronaut helmet kinda shifted full of lipstick

Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription

We out of this world baby we have been evicted



Intergalactical love

The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love

And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you

On the dark side of the moon

Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you

On the dark side of the moon

And If you happen to get there before me

Leave a message in the dust just for me

If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you

Open up the curtains

Wonder watching, people killing-robbing

The sky is falling, falling down

It turns into news and this is the apocalypse

People living on they rocket ships

My mama always told me that there would be no stopping this

Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room, of I and you

Tell me will I see you soon

Meet you on the moon?

Hope it ain't too many feelings involved
I see niggas in this bitch, stuntin', popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches and when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her

Then she let us in, we take all of your shit

And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches

I tell her, ""Get 'em"" she say, ""I got you""

I say, ""No, bitch, I say get 'im""

And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties

And she give us the word, we come through with AKs

It's a stick up, she scream like a victim

Now you feeling so silly

I smoke color purple

I'm up in here feeling like Celie (ooh)

Nappy ass dreads, what's that you say?

Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (ooh)

You can get snaked, you can get faced

I'll buy the bitch that you feeling

'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee

And you telling your business, she tell me your business

You tell that bitch what you're feeling

All of the beans you be spilling

To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillings

She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden

She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit, we'll break in your home

And take the specifics and meanwhile the bitch is on vacation with him so she don't get blamed

We don't snatch chains, we find out addresses

And we don't leave messes

You only know that it's gone when you check it

Then your first thought is to start second guessing

She say, ""What's wrong?""

You say, ""Nothing, keep resting""

She say, ""What's missing?"" ""How you know something missing?""

He scratch his head, she say get back in bed

And she gave him some head

Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say

Ooh, I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', popping bottles

Getting drunk with these bitches and when they leave, they get followed

I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we following

Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, don't be so obvious

Mona Lisa

Long hair, don't care, she handle the business and don't ever tell

She bite the bullet and cough up the shells

She tell 'im, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place""

And if he say, ""Yeah,"" then we meet him there

She feed him lies with his silverware

She don't want love, she just want her share

I, know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his

'Cause she tell him that it is

So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears

And then she tell me, and I be all ears

And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him

And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over

I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""

She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""

We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up

Walk up to the door and right before he knock, she open the door naked

She left it unlocked

They started French kissing so he didn't see moi

And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch

Music up loud with his head in the cloud

Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him

Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown

Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down

You know what it is, put your fucking hands up

Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down

And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her

She a good actress and you a dead actor

You'll be dead after we get what we're after

If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh

I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga

But think for me, nigga

Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga

I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga

She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga

She slip something in it, now thank for me, nigga

Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture

Mo-mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas

Pussy got you out of character, nigga

You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga

Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion

We have you attention and now you're looking down a barrel though, nigga

Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga

We just looking for the casserole, nigga

But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga



Ah, everyday she wake up with a different color make up

And I promise to go take her to the movie and the mall

Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, fourth minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball

Paparazzi looking at them both popping up and take a picture, uh

Probably on a Internet blog

In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her on his mother

Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow

Mona Lisa

Pussy good enough, it got 'em sending into wars

And he digging in it like he living in it

Make a new religion with it

Man a nigga 'bout to go against God

Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird, when she asked him, did he want to make love in a yellow taxi

Never gave two fuck, jumped in the backseat

Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby

Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie

I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing

I'ma call up again like I did last week

Make good with the friend and I'm more jazzy

Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley

Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy

Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me

Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me

'Bout a motherfucking double standard, acting

Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone

But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty

Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone (No)

You fucking with Wayne? (No)

Bitch, gimme your phone

(No, let me take this call real quick)

...lick me like a lollipop

He on your fucking ringtone?

Is that the shit that you do?

Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos

Jump on the internet, watching his interviews

I don't know what the fuck, lately gotten into you

Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder

Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?

The pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma daycare after school

And she never did charge her

You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up

You know what, I get buck, let me go get my gun, I got one in the chamber

I'm plannin' on aimin', God dammit, you know that the damage is done

Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress

I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess

So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killing that pussy I'm killing myself



She say, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

She say, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Now he get the picture Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah"

Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, dear life shit

So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it

I just hope I die for a reason

They probably won't miss me ’til they need me

Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord

I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit

Goodbye letter, dear life shit

Way too concerned to be conceited

I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord

Die tryna reach 'em

They care more about how much I leave 'em

Where’d I leave it?

I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids

To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord

Just got off the phone with my son

Told him, ""You a son of a gun""

Just got off the phone with my daughter

Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord

A few bitches left me

And only got a new bitch elected

My old bitch was too disrespectful

And only give my new bitch respect

That's power, yes

So now we’re next

Can't lie though, I tried though

I'll die tryin', that’s a common death

We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams

Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath

Now they try to tell me I need rest

And I'l find love again, I ain't find it yet

Oh, but I guess it is what it is

As it appears, oh shit

The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit

And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird

He done died so many times but still here

Why am I here? Here

Life

What is my meaning? My reason?

Naked bitches really love ones

Sometimes our loved ones don't love us

I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love

Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber

I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""

Even though I make it look easy

But understand looks are deceiving

Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance

'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it

Crank it 'bout it, gotta drink about it

Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it

Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'

Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me

Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'

I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die

Can't deny it, you can't take my lion

I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string

I can't describe it

Feel like a anchor tied to my finger

Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink

I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas

There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength

I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga

So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink

It's way too real

The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real

I hope it gave you chills

The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill

You don't know how dead you feel until you're dead for real

Gettin' high after I paid the bill

Lower than a Navy SEAL

Show up with them Navy guns

I hope somebody prayin' for 'em

Price tag, no mistake, somebody payin' for 'em

Ice baths, when my face numb, no expression

What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?

Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive. Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive""

I don't get too high to look over blessings

Never come in second, make the most of your seconds

They so precious

'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it

If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling

I keep it real, niggas better keep it copasetic

Where the weed at? I'm gettin' a sober headache

Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better

I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter



Dear life

What is my meaning? My reason?

That's the question

I ask the reader

God bless the reader

Dear life

What is my meaning? My reason?

That's the question



You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that"

And when you say timber, please, will you whisper, my nigga, I'm quietly fallin'



If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right then, bitch you hate me

I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken

Rest In peace, I rest in peace and harmony

I don't talk, I speak, after I pray, I preach

I don't play, I cheat, after I stay, I leave

The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat

Turn that piggy bank to some hog head cheese

But you doin' nothing while they sayin' nothing

And never worth nothing, but it's always free, psychopath

Blunt big, big as Mama June off the diet plan, smokin' science lab

I should have tattoo that say ""I'm nothin' like your man""

Jesus Christ, Amen!

All my nigga balling, that's how it's supposed to be, hoe

I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode

Coke sniffers and dope stickers

And most niggas was both, nigga

Explode nigga, pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga

To those niggas, 'cause life's too fucking short, nigga

Get old nigga, I ain't lying

Got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer

Be a role player, role model, when you roll with her

And they say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga

That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em

Man, all my niggas targets, that's including me, hoe

I could change the world, I rather change the people

And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles

All your haters fueling, my needle broke

I fell in love with a stripper, lord I know she got bills but Imma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas

Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel

I'm a mess



And now she over talking about

I say thats the shit and we fast forward till the morning time

Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, make up and lashes

Shit happens cause my days is a mess

But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go

Now she feel like she on death row

She dont believe in ghosts till I get ghosts and I can hear your teardrops echo

Her teardrops turn into petrol

Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe cause



Because my days is a mess

My nights is a mess

My life is a mess

My life is a mess

My life is a mess of happiness less sex obsession desire with no love

Fuck it, more one's, my bae is a mess, my side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess

I guess, my bae is obsessed, my side bitch possessed, my wifey careless

But you gonna have to excuse my mess

Yes, fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones

Fuck it more ones



Im making a mess with all these ones, fuck it, more ones

My life is a mess of happiness less sex obsession desire with no love

Fuck it, more one's"

He helped me send in my ego
And I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror my hero
He helped me see like an eagle

He helped me hear all my enemies cry wolf

Then he saw me take off my sheep clothes



Hasta la vista, Adios

Beat the eyes like mosquitoes

Keep in mind I'm a negro so my open mind got a screen door

Bitches wanna come play the lead role

And end up with nothin but B-roll

Sit in the dick in a C-4

Then I come back with a cheap coat

Pill bottle only half full

But fuck it my nigga, I'm past good

Text a bitch, rubbin' my tats good

But before she do, bitch, wash yo hands good

I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull

You can't make a fist cause I'm a handful

I never really knew my dad good

But still grew up to be the big bad wolf

You always see me with the white cup

Some people say that is a bad look

But take a good look at what you are lookin' at

You never never know when it's your last look

It's written all over my face

These tattoos, they can't be erased

One of a kind, I can't be replaced

In case, that mirror breaks



Well it's been way too long

And I wonder what it's been like

Tryna get back right with ya

It's hard being on my own

Or at least that's what it feels like

Wanna get back right with ya

It's been way too long

And I wonder what it's been like



Man in the mirror my hero

He helped me center my evil

I see the fire in his eyes

But he keep my blood temperature zero

Man in the mirror my 'migo

Creme de la, creme de la creole

Couple a cracks in the mirror, he been through the cracks

I see no cracks in me, though



Daytime, start to turn black

Everything stop like start to twirl

Thank God, Weezy back, order is restored, all is right with the world

Last time, because we lost time

No free time, till I bought time

No tee time, no off time

No me time, on y'all time

Blessins', showers from the north side

From the brightest flower out the darkest skies

Love is blind, but we caught eyes

It's a bumpy road, but a joyride

Still, can't ignore my rappin' tight

Like my hunger sharp, but [?]

Still the mothafuckin' best rapper, A-live

Nigga, y'all died



Well it's been way too long

And I wonder what it's been like

Tryna get back right with ya

It's hard being on my own

Or at least that's what it feels like

Wanna get back right with ya

It's been way too long

And I wonder what it's been like

Well it's been way too long

And I wonder what it's been like

Tryna get back right with ya

It's hard being on my own

Or at least that's what it feels like

Wanna get back right with ya

It's been way too long

And I wonder what it's been like



Man in the mirror my hero

He he got me centered, my ego

And I think I'm bad like Michael

He bring me back down to Tito

Written all over my face

Tattoos that can't be erased

One of a kind, I can't be erased

In case, them be the breaks"

Talking to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous
Sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman doing the same shit

But, you don't even call anymore

And you don't even care

So who am I to love anyone

I know it's fucked up

Different city, switching women

Putting cups up, getting fucked up



And, we don't even talk anymore

Ain't go no time to spare

So who are we to trust anyone

And that's whats fucked up

We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other

And that's a fuck up



Damn, love don't live here

Love, I don't live here

She say ""Why you leave your shit here?""

I'm tryna' be sincere

When we both know it ain't right

She hate that we can get lose

But I can never hang tight



We don't even make love anymore

Acting like I've hung out of intention

I'll be watching television

And it's painless

We act like we strangers

I just don't know who we are anymore



I'm not supposed to be here

'Cause love don't live here

But I'm here, and she here

She tell me stay all night

She just want a refill

And then she want to start fights

'Bout what about how she feel

She tell me I'm a cheap thrill

I know she don't mean that

She think I feed her lies

But I don't get no feedback

As she watch me pack

""Baby where my keys at?""

Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back

Her teeth smacked



I don't know who you are any more

Talking to the man in her mirror

That been fuckin' with these bitches

We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other

And that's a fuck up



I was talking to myself the other day

My homies call me cray

My momma tell me ""Pray""

She said I need a day

I said I need a bae

She said believe in faith

Mom, they love me either way

Hold up, wait

Let me set my alarm

You say don't sweat your alarm

And now the pressure is on

So now there's sweat in my palm

But her reception ain't warm

So my deception preforms

And then that silence is awkward

Like am I deaf or alone

I got a jet in the morn'

And she upset and I'm calm

And when a women in scarring

Is when welcome is worn

Now her temperature is showing

And I just weathered her storm

And she expect me to stay

I be like ""Let go my arm!""

She said...



I don't know who you are any more

Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah

I'm in this bitch

Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch

But now I’m in this bitch

Yeah, I'm in this bitch

Tunechi you a genius

Looked in the mirror said

""Don't let the money come between us""

I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience

But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers

I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers

Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color

And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder

The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble

Real shit, look at my candle, still lit

Had to swallow my pride, though, swag tastes like spearmint

Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em

I never turn my back on ’em

Cold nigga act like they cool with ya

But a lot of these niggas be transformers

A lot of these players be bench-warmers

The game ain’t easy, but it's fair, nigga

I’mma sit in this throne so long

'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga

Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga

Said, ""Relax, tell him baby don't stress out""

But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though

She said, ""Let that shit work itself out""

""Let that shit work itself out""



C5

Yeah, back in this bitch

Tune you left this bitch

Like you knew this bitch was gon’ let your ass back in this bitch

""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

But nobody else like you in this bitch

""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

""Let it all work out""

Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch



Cita you a psychic

'Cause you said there be days like this

They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices

Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers

Real shit, put some niggas on that guilt trip

It'll be on in a heartbeat

You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip

I fear God, never fear men

Give back, never give in

V.I.'s never be women

Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it

Reach highs, never reach limits

Need minds, I don't need clinics

This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz

When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight

I almost asked her to creep with me

But I was young, and I held my tongue

But with that tongue, I just keep spitting

So it all worked out



And now I'm in this bitch

And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""

I never change, you know I been this bitch

And then she said, ""Let it all work out""

""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)

""Let it all work out, let it all work out""



Tunechi, you a monster

Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya

I'm lookin' for that big old smile, full of diamonds

Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'

It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""

I tried, comprising and went kamikaze

I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it

I cry, put it to my head and thought about it

Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie

Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered

Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it

Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding

I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me

It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying

God came to my side and we talked about it

He sold me another life and he made a prophet



Yeah, and he said

""Let it all work out"" (yeah)

""Let it all work out""

(I'm still in this bitch)

""Let it all work out""

(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)

""Let it all work out""

Let it all work out (phew)

""Let it all work out""

(But he said, ""Remember this:"")

""Let it all work out""

""Let it all work out""

(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")

""Let it all work out"" (yeah)

""Let it all work out""

(And don't forget what I did this, bitch)

""Let it all work out""

(Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch"")

""Let it all—""

""Let it all work out"" (yeah)

""Let it all work out""

(Now I'm out this bitch)

""Let it all work out""

(I'm out this bitch)

""Let it all—""

(And it all worked out)

I'm going to the bank

I come in a tank

I come with the drank

I come with the drapes

I crush out the face

Patek Phillipe, I'm too unique

Gotta stop all the leaks

Getting caught with the freaks



I pour up codeine

I can't go to sleep

Criminal mind

Thanks to the gang, gang

Louboutins, sitting in a row

Louis Vuitton's, mink on the flows

My migo the coldest

He got me the frozest

I ordered it loaded, soon as they touched down

I sold it

The money is stacked up off the ground

You could never fold it

I done got racked up

I done stacked up me a fortune

Colossal, enormous

Have you seen my preformance

You making it drizzle

I got thunder and storming

Ain't no discussion

I got 'em busted

I got a flooded Richard Mille

It ain't no cuffing

Screaming, blushing

She came from Russia

Digital scale

My kind is rare

I had to prevail

I made it through Hell

See the wheel on the right

When you live overseas

Think it came overnight

How I make it look easy

Ain't a regular nigga

I accept that

Got ahead of you niggas

And I never took a step back



How many stains you hit

I'm bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne around my room
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't

Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka

That's me in the Lamb, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa

AK-47 my business partner, business is swell

French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell

I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well

Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail

From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell

I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale

These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls

Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

Uh, glory, hallelujah

Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure

I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers

I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy Ramen noodles

And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters

You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'

I'm aqua-cuckoo, I turn your Fruit Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo

I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you, glory



I'm aqua-cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo

I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new

I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU

Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too

I drive a neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther

I'm not accuser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her

My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas

I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than Tyga's Nikes, Pumas

Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on

My weed louder than underarms and car alarms

Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long

I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board

But all this fuckin' art destroyed, this the art of war

These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark

I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark

I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?



Uh, glory, hallelujah

Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi

Unload the Glock profusely, I'm soarin' out confusion

Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart

I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins

Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence

Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it

It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'

Lord, oh, Lord



Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe

I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated

The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest

My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it

She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe

We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady

I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti

I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy

Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental

Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials

That's private, tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'

Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably

Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies

No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus

No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory

It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory



Uh, glory, hallelujah

Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser

My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users

You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus

My tie is Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless

My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies

I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human

You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi

You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em"

Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly

I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes

Sometimes I wonder if I already died

That shit get deep, deep, deep

Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep



Been going hard all day, wish a nigga would fuck with me

Then I blow the candles out on my cake

And niggas always thinking it's a game, 'til we ran them out the arcade

Stunting in my southern player, reach the caddy like Andre

I talk that cash money shit

YM plus CMB you can do the math for me bitch

Jail time a slap on the wrist

Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips

You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist

Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist

Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense

I got some miles on me but it's cool cause I never get an inch

And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say

Cause shit is deep and in rap I cannot say

That shit enough times like somebody rewind me

Like shit is deeper than rap I cannot say, that shit enough times

I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine

Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs

Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine

Fuck the finish line, just finish in lines

And if getting your point across crosses the line

Some of the time, then cross it with pride

That's real my nigga, remember that

And ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap

So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that

This shit is deep, deep as empty pockets, nigga

We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime

That shit get deep



Man I look up to god

I wonder if I fell from the sky

Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly

I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes

Sometimes I wonder if I already died

That shit get deep, deep, deep

Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep"

I'm bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne around my room
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't

Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka

That's me in the Lamb, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa

AK-47 my business partner, business is swell

French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell

I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well

Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail

From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell

I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale

These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls

Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

Uh, glory, hallelujah

Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure

I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers

I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy Ramen noodles

And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters

You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'

I'm aqua-cuckoo, I turn your Fruit Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo

I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you, glory



I'm aqua-cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo

I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new

I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU

Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too

I drive a neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther

I'm not accuser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her

My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas

I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than Tyga's Nikes, Pumas

Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on

My weed louder than underarms and car alarms

Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long

I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board

But all this fuckin' art destroyed, this the art of war

These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark

I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark

I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?



Uh, glory, hallelujah

Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi

Unload the Glock profusely, I'm soarin' out confusion

Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart

I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins

Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence

Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it

It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'

Lord, oh, Lord



Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe

I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated

The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest

My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it

She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe

We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady

I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti

I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy

Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental

Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials

That's private, tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'

Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably

Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies

No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus

No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory

It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory



Uh, glory, hallelujah

Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser

My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users

You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus

My tie is Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless

My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies

I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human

You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi

You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em"

Love only lasts if my heart races on
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster
Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on it, on

I'm racing on, if my heart races on



Uh, I'm priceless, remember me like they remember the Titans

Reality bit me and continue to bite me

Got no degree but where I'm from, that's the original climate

Where you can't tell a fiend a crack rock isn't a diamond

Hold on, Lord if my Bugatti come to a dead end

I've already been everywhere except heaven

And tomorrow's not promised, when I'm gone but not forgotten

I hope my homies calming down my momma, Lord

I guess I'll see you on that other side

Where the flowers never die, the angels never lie

Yeah, the revolution will be televised

I just hope my contribution will be memorized

Oh, momma hate I got my daddy's eyes

Never looked into my daddy's eyes, he ain't have the time

Fuck him, the revolution will be televised

I just hope my contribution will be memorized

I'm racing on, if (I'm gone), my heart races on



Uh, Tunechi you an angel

Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one

Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes

I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it then exchanged it

Fuck it, I'm working bitch, I know you see me working

Searching for better days, before a better person

I'm perfect, just ask my bitch and she'll say that's so urgent

I purchased, my children gifts and I just keep the curses

Yeah, my heart right and my head ain't, cause I'm never in my right mind

But I'm Einstein when I do think, and I grew wings

If you catch a feather just keep it, and I'll be racing on

No short cuts, no cheating



When this world comes crashing

And time flies right past us (Hold on)

Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)

So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster (Hold on)

Cause love only lasts if my heart races on

(My heart right and my head ain't)

I'm racing on if (I'm gone), on, (I'm gone)

I'm racing on, if (I'm gone)

My (There's nothing left but to fly, if you catch a feather just keep it) heart races on



This morning I woke up on my good side

Life is just a race against time so have a good time

Heart racing, thoughts racing, competition, goodbye

I turn around, run backwards to see what second place look like

Oh Lord, what are we running from?

The police cause they already killed enough of us

Stay out them streets cause they don't fuck with us, they hunting us

We in a race against racists, that's a color run

I keep my feet above the ground, we gon' run the town

Heart racing on, beat, beat, beating, knock and pound

Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile

I see no finish line, on your mark, set, pow"

I turn into Freddy, my fingers machetes
Trap house jumpin' like Monta Ellis
We trap out the teli when we outta town
Uzi on deck, phone ringin' off the hook

Bitch that's the plug

Ocean view bedroom baby

See through showers and I just put some fish in my tub

Hold up I ain't playin', niggas say they rich I say eeh

Same old song I don't dance

Heater on my waist hotter than a frying pan

If you don't see what I'm saying I give your ass a fuckin' eye exam

I ain't playin', guns in my hands I ain't prayin'

Fireman spittin' venom, Spiderman, I'm enhanced

I'm at peace, joggin' pants cost at least about a grand

I'm advanced like Japan, got more sand than Sudan, lord



And life ain't nothin' but a long day

And tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way, away

You know the haters come in all sizes, all shapes (okay)

That's why I had to get a little more trunk space

Gotta insurance on the trap house, Allstate

Got the trap house pumpin' like a heart rate

Got the trap house pumpin' like an 808

Boom like an 808



I could fly around that bitch need a tarmac

I just landed in Cuba need a straw hat

I gotta get the raw back I need a format

I put the shit on horseback and start my own ranch

From where they don't talk smack, they just snort smack

I turn your head to an open hot sauce pack

I tell the bitch some true lies and some false facts

Boy I'm drownin' in the syrup like a short stack

Ooh, 187, 211, hockey mask on, Wayne Gretzky

Stunt my ass off, chain heavy

Your bitch get passed on, chain letter

Train smoker, smoke plain never

Had a date with the devil, then I changed schedule

I'm a trained killer, like a paid killer

Better yet Saddam Hussein nephew

Nigga no love

That's from the bottom of my heart

I pull up and paint yo' whole fucking block red

And get out of my car and admire my art

Then smile at my thoughts

My bitch from Atlanta got eyes like a Hawk, she see why I'm a boss

I just got another speeding ticket on the Bugatti

While it was parked

Now I don't wanna talk, bitch I don't wanna talk

Lean in my punch, I decided to spar, anybody want war?

I'm excited to start, get indicted tomorrow, I be out by the morning, before I even yawn

Stay in ya' lane, I remind these little boys, this is victory lane, now do I need a horn?

The struggle is real, and the Bible too long

I'm writing my will, and I'm typing my won't's

Lord please, Kilo's OZ's

Cause my bitch act like she like Pinot and cheese

I dropped out of class so I'm zero degrees

I can out-think a shrink, she can deep throat a tree

I can hijack a brincle, my sweet soda pink

I'm a freak-show to freaks

I'm spitting these bars, hope my bartap is cheap

I'm a hard man to reach, I'm newborn and deceased

I'm too hard for this beat, I'm the heart and the beat

The Chong and the Cheech, my blunt long as a speech

Roach look like a leech, I'm too long for the brief

I'm too wrong for the priest, with this chrome on your teeth that get blown out yo' cheek

Like my bitch mixed, like Long Island Tea

She don't hide her figure, she don't hide her feet

I'm the head nigga, like prodigy

And bitch I'mma shine, like Connery

Gettin' wasted with my girl

Then we 69 'til we need ventilation

You don't know about it

Gotta open new accounts cause the others overcrowded

Gotta open up the stores when they're closed when we shoppin'

For my girl, wear the clothes that ain't nobody rockin'

She so bad, I don't know what to do with her

I know just what to do in her

Homies hit me up, they said they're goin' out tonight

I got a new vision for all my shit, I don't know what to call that shit

I know, I'm selling all of my cars, I'm selling all of my watches, I'm selling diamonds and all of that shit

Realized I don't need that shit, I'm a different breed with this shit

I'm tryna turn M's to B's in this shit and I ain't ever pay to be with no bitch

I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed, fifty mill in one room

You could ask anyone out here, who running the game, and they'll tell you the truth

Man, oh look, they fuck with me now, I think they're hearin' me now

Someone said Nigga they takin' you seriously now""

I'm like ""I think they might just be scared of me now""

But it's all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day

Goin' to LA where I'm tryna get high and do a song every day

Safe, we ain't ever have to play it safe

I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe

Then peek inside the safe and see I'm runnin' out of space

Mothafucka that's grindin'



Nigga I'm grindin' for all my shit

I'm grindin' for all my shit

Yeah, I'm grindin' for all my shit

Grindin', grindin'

Grindin', grindin'

Grindin', grindin'

I would rather step it up and put it in the safe then peek inside the safe and say I'm running out of space, believe that

School find another oo-wop

Tell them niggas cool down

Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out

Kidnap a nigga beat the truth out

Moms pick the suit out

Top floor, window he get threw out

Duke out

Pussy bitches, douche out

Flying out the crew out

They flew out invite them to my new house, my new house

I'm fucking every night up in my new house

We'll check into it like the room cheap

They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork

Ain't got nothing left to prove unless I got to prove it in court

Live fast die young and leave a beautiful corpse, yes Lord

My nigga order like twenty bricks, I said five bricks with four chicks

Ridin' with these guns that's carpoolin', bought extra clips when I dove in

Kill everybody you close with, Just don't stick your nose in

The people that I rolls with will leave holes in what you drove in

If anyone in that car live, you tell that nigga I owe him

Yeah, I got my mind right, and my money right, my head on my shoulder

Got witches all in my broom closet, got little killers in [?]

We'll find out your business hours and pop up like [?]

Like danger taste like glucose, my shadow don't get too close

To that new nigga with my old hoes--kudos

For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno

Getting swole like popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno

I'm in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points

A.K to your face, not half off like coupons

Too cool for school but I sold cool points to school boys

Tell the cops we don't name drop that's like dropping newborns

Nigga you crazy



You so crazy, Tunechi

These hoes made

Nigga tell me somethin' I don't know



Like where the fuck did my heart go, and show me something I haven't seen

And tell me what Martin seen, on the same night he had a dream

And take me to where I've never been, but not to where I'll never be

And I ain't never scared but I'm scared of me, me versus me I need a referee

Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy

Fuck deputies big letter B, need equity, need credit cleaned

To trafficking from peddling like everything from amphetamines to medicine

These niggas sweeter than Nectarines and Grenadine



You so cray, Tunechi

You so cray, bitch

I know, I know, I know, I know

Tell me something I don't know, like what happened to hard coke

You can call me Eddy cause I stay ready, my family call me Eduardo

I'm music to these bitches ears I hit that ass like the wrong note

My bitch bad with corn rows with boots on in farm clothes

You can find me prancing in the finest mansion with the finest dancer with a height advantage

She want cocaine pills and weed, liquor and dick she gotta micro manage

I'm just eating rappers they go nice in salads with some diced up carrots

I just like a challenge, psychopathic I'm psychopathic

Nigga give me credit on my balance

It's so strange but this girl named Dana, like to go anal

Shoot 'em in his head, what's that? A no brainer

Plain ol' n*gga, but a break from the norm

I wear my heart on my sleeve so don't be breakin' my arm

I rather ring ya f*ckin' neck before I ring the alarm

I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me alone

Wit 'em, I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair

F*ck with me, ya ass is grass... get a lawn chair

I was f*cking before my d*ck started growin' hair

B*tches sweatin' me like John Mayer, or warm air

If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed

Mama said take what you want  I took heed yea

Now let it breathe, yea, back to life, back to reality

Been eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities

Granted we do it for vanity not humanity

But what's appealing to me is under banana trees, love

I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged

Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shell

Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail

Same shit, different air freshner

I don't play boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner

Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind

Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind

I be in the cloud, cloud number 9

And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time

It's a cold world, I put on a mink

There's a chain of commands, I'm the missing link

But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper

So love or hate me, I stay hate-free

They say we learn from mistakes, that's why they mistake me

I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers

All hail Weezy, call it bad weather

I stick to the script, I memorize the lines



Life is a movie that I've seen too many times

You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds

And they say never say never, but fuck your nevermind

Y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher

I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker

And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her

You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids

But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises

Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?

Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM

I think you stand under me if you don't understand me

Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy

But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy

Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest

I beat the beat up, call it self defense

Swear man, I be seeing through these n-ggas like sequins

N-ggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end

Talking to myself because I am my own consultant

Married to the money, f-ck the world, that's adultery

You full of sh-t, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk

Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt

Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt

Mind so sharp, I f-ck around and cut my head off

Real n-gga all day and tomorrow

But these muthaf-ckas talking crazy like they jaw broke

Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya



Try me and run into a wall, outfielder

You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights

The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe

Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do

If these n-ggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon

Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall

I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all

And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on

But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on

Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it

Young Money, Cash Money

Paper chasing, tell that paper, ?Look, I'm right behind ya?

Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna

People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda

Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her

You n-ggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant

I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate

Yeah, with a swag you would kill for

Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder

Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well

Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda

Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bald like Cuba

And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya

I be mackin', 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover

Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter

N-ggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler

Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler

Wayne, these n-ggas out they mind

I done told these f-ck n-ggas, so many times

That I keep these bucks steady on my mind

Tuck these, I f-ck these on your mind, pause

To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?

Keep throwin' my sign in the middle

Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch

All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon-toed

She used to always say, fuck my niggas

And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas

Well, I guess I'm single for the night

And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night

When you was just a young'un you're looks but so precious

But now your grown up

So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds

Without you being insecure

You never credit yourself so when you got older

It's seems like you came back 10 times over

Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

Had a love



You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions

But it wasn't your fault

Wasn't in your intentions

You the one here talking to me

You don't wanna listen

But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin'

Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping

Baby, so don't be mad

Nobody else trippin

That you deserve the best

You're beautiful

[Verse 1:]
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can

Money on my mind as god as my witness

Love don't live here and it don't even visit

I do this for my uptown politicians

Walked in the kitchen and found a pocket pissin'

Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'

Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em

Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms

Told tools like mechanics, mechanism

Uh, Detrimental on any instrumental

I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals

I'm beneficial, I've been official

I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu

I like my short cake shorter

Ain't no mother fucker harder than (Carter)



[Hook]



[Verse 2:]

Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances

Your family tree, I will break branches

Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin

Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes

The future is born, put the past in the casket

If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard

Uh, appetite for disaster

I want a full plate then another plate after

Uh, yesterday just died

Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives

When shit get deep I'm never afraid to die

Let the money pile up and tell 'em buried alive

Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell

Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale

Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office

I changed the stars on the flag into crosses



[Interlude:]

Amen...

[Verse 3:]

Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga

I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga

Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga

Realitys a bitch and I'm a dance with her

140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground

Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge

I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused

I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while

Uh, and we all want world peace

Murder show, I give your ass good seats

Shit, I'm much more than a good speech



[Outro:]

Gorillas in suits

The holy war, the spiritual troops

Fighting over the mythical truth

Drowning in the political soup

They shoot missiles and nukes

Taking out such a pivotal group

The body count is the physical proof

And they thought drugs were killing the youth"

Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish

Now we get high, call that shit karate

Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy

Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side

Yeah, I got a pussy hangover

Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover

Murder the perception, make em get it right

If I'm flirting with affection, I'm fucking her that night

I'm a Southern delight, Louisiana pride

The belly of the beast, it ate me alive

Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive

Ever since the day that I took a walk outside

Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag

Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting

I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect

Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters

But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper

So love or hate me, I stay hate-free

They say we learn from mistakes, that's why they mistake me

I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers

All hail Weezy, call it bad weather

I stick to the script, I memorize the lines



Life is a movie that I've seen too many times

You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds

And they say never say never, but fuck your nevermind

I've been gone too long

I've been gone too long

True or false, right or wrong

Young money's eating, the label getting fatter

And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at em

I'm a bad motherfucker, cause the good die young

EVerybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one

Man when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb

Shoot that hummingbird down, Hummingbird don't hum

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher

Y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher

I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker

And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her

You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids

But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises

Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?

Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM

Beach bum, call me ocean drive slim

Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin

Young moola, skinnies and some supras

Belly of the beast till it pukes

I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine

She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in seen this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend

But I can't keep hearing it over and over again

I was the one that you came to when you broke up with your boyfriend

Man, fuck him

Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas

And you still fucked them other niggas

Most people learn from the bad things

I hope that you learn

And don't crash and burn in the fast lane

But if you read this letter then you caught me

This should explain all the ways that you taught me



[Hook: T-Pain]

How to hate a bitch

That owe you everything

At least a wedding ring

Moving on to better things

So don't you call me talking bout them other fools

I'm not good enough for you

I thought that we was cool

If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen

I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches



[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

And I don't love them hoes

But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it ""Waynes"" it pours

No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit

You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch

I had a red bone, but she be tripping though

All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon-toed

She used to always say, fuck my niggas

And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas

Well, I guess I'm single for the night

And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night

And if I sound mad, then you caught me

But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me



[Hook: T-Pain]



[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]

Coke in the Ciroc

Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot

I'm over the bitch, and she over the top

They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock

Well, and I wish I never met ya

And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better

And all I had to do was put two and two together

But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn

So much for being the perfect couple

I put in overtime, I was working doubles

I wish you the best, good luck boo

Weezy F, for fuck you



[Bridge: T-Pain]

No ain't nothing going on

Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home

Get away from here, girl I'm so glad you're gone

This is the last song I'm writing for you

Now I see how you can be

I don't want you 'round you me

All you do is down me girl

How many years I tried to get ya

Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl?

I know your name, yeah

Your name is ""unimportant""

We in the belly of the beast

I woke up this morning, dick rock hard

Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award

You can save your bullshit on your memory card

If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed

Jumped on the celly, called Machiavelli

He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly

Looked in the mirror, said ""You's an I'll nigga""

Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga

Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars

In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers

I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked

I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets

Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude

The haters music to my ears, I got my dancin shoes

Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to

But I just built a house on ""I don't give a fuck"" Avenue

Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed

Life is a gamble better check the point spread

And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head

I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds

Smoking on a hallelujah, thank you Jesus

Help me focus on the future and not the previous

Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason

Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon

Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees

Underground shit, I see myself as a seed

Living in the glass, and everybody's looking

How can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?

This current affairs, but who the hell cares?

Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs

On the road to redemption, go on and use a few stairs

I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

I want a full plate then another plate after

Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives

Rikers Island on this flow, 8 months for that pistol

But at least they had some bad bitches workin' in that shit hole

Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out

And then November came, they let my nigga out



[Lil Wayne:]

Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit

Niggas act like bitches. Shanaynay, oh my goodness

Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch

Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby power

I just touched down, kick the motherfuckin field goal

Talkin 'bout baby money? I got your baby money

Kidnap your bitch, get that 'how much you love your lady' money

I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga

I loved her fancy underwear
I sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get
To tell her I'm the one she should be with
She's popular with all the guys

So innocent in my eye

I could see her in my life

She would've had the perfect sweet man

But

See she had other plans

I could not understand

Her and her stupid friends

Varsity's biggest fans



[Chorus:]

Never forget the day

She laughed and walked away

And I couldn't stop her

I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out

But she left me with a broken heart

Fucked around and turned me down

Cause she didn't think I could play the part

But now the prom queen the prom queen

Is crying sittin' outside of my door

She never know how

How everything could turn around



[Verse 2:]

Uhh

They loved her fancy underwear

Every boyfriend every year

She tried to keep 'em entertained

When they can hardly remember her name

She did everything she could just to

To make him love and treat her good

She found herself alone

Askin' herself where did she go wrong

She didn't realize

She chased the type of guys

That don't believe in ties

Tryin' to apologize



[Chorus:]

Never forget the day

She laughed and walked away

And I couldn't stop her

I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out

But she left me with a broken heart

Fucked around and turned me down

Cause she didn't think I could play the part

But now the prom queen the prom queen

Is crying sittin outside of my door

She never know how

How everything could turn around



Get up!



She had it all figured out

But she left me with a broken heart

Fucked around and turned me down

Cause she didn't think I could play the part

But now the prom queen the prom queen

Is crying sittin outside of my door

She never know how

How everything could turn around"

I got ice in my veins
blood in my eye
hate in my heart

love in my mind

I seen nights full of pain

days of the same

you keep the sunshine

save me the rain

I search but never find

hurt but never cry

i work and forever try

but im cursed so never mind

and its worse but better times

seems further and beyond

the top gets higher the more that I climb

the spot gets smaller and I get bigger

tryna get me where I fit in

no room for a n-gga but soon for a n-gga it be on mutherf-cker cause

all this bullsh-t have made me strong, mutherf-cker



[Chorus]

So I pick the world up and im a drop it on your f-ckin head

yeah, bitch ima pick the World up and I'ma drop it on your f-ckin head

yeah, and I can die now, rebirth mutherf-cker

hop up in my spaceship and leave earth motherfucker

I'm gone, mutherf-cker, I'm gone



[Lil Wayne Verse 2]

I know what they dont wanna tell you

just hope your heaven sent and ya hell proof

i'll wake up in the World and cut the lights off

and confidence is a stain they cant wipe off

uh, my word is my pride

but wisdom is bleak and thats a word from the wise

served to survive, murder and bribed

and when it got too heavy i put my burden aside..



[Chorus]



[Eminem]

it hurts but I never show,

this pain you'll never know

if only you can see just how lonely and how cold

and frostbit i've become

my back's against the wall

when push come to shove

i just stand up and scream f-ck em all

man it feels like these walls are closing in, this roof is caving in,

oop its time to raise it then

your days are numbered like pages in my book of rhymes got em cookem boy

this crooked mind of mine got em all shook and scared to look in my eyes,

I stole that f-ckin clock, i took the time and i came up from behind

and pretty much snuck up and butt f-cked this game up

better be careful when you bring my name up f-ck this fame

that aint what i came to claim, but the game aint gonna be the same

on the day that i leave it

I swear one way or another i'ma make these f-ckin haters believe it,

I swear to God wont spear the rod, i'm a man of my word

so your f-ckin heads better nod

im gonna f-ck around in this bitch and roast everybody

sleep on me that pillow is where your head will lie, permanently bitch it's beddy-bye,

this world is my easter egg, yeah, prepare to die'

lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com

my head is swoll

my confidence is up

this stage is my pedastal

im unstoppable the incredible hulk

your trapped in my medicine ball

I can run circles around you so fast your f-ckin head will spin dog,

I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll f-ckin

And I make her feel special like a place kicker,

She wanna be weezy f baby sitter,

Say she wish she could cut my d-ck off and take it with her,

I say hold on,

She say she just playing,

Then I falls in that p-ssy like quick sand,

Uh, hot sex and cold wine,

She left that n-gga hanging like a clothes line,

I cut my phones off, both lines,

It's bout to get nasty, pork rinds,

She came hard both times,

We both say we single,

And we both lying,

We both wrong but it feel right,

Put your hands up if you single for the night,

Put your hands up if you single,

Pussy has a pattern and I know where I'm going

And if you got beef I turn into a tenderloin

Sanity kills so I live the crazy life

I wonder if you'll pay attention if I change the price

Life is my wife, till death do us part

Man I'm fly as fuck you ain't even next to depart

Who else really tryna fuck with Hollywood Cole? I'm with Marley G, bro

Flying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows

And I wanna tell you something that you prolly should know

This that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow

And uh, my real friends never hearin' from me

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me

That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused

I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews

We walk the same path, but got on different shoes

Live in the same building, but we got different views

I got a couple cars I never get to use

Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos

And these days all the girls is down to roll

I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole

Plus I been sippin', so this shit is movin' kinda slow

Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go



(Lil Wayne)

And I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig?

And I don't bust back, because I shoot first



Meet me on the fresh train

Yes, I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names

And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X Games

Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change

And I smoke 'til I got chest pains

And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James

Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne

I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin' plane

Skinny pants and some Vans

Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen

As the world spin and dance in my hands

Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand

Uh, wake up and smell the pussy

You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me

I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin' where it took me

Yeah, and I ain't a killa, but don't push me

Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red

Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg

Ma'fuckin' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade

Ball on automatic start

I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw

Wildcat offense, check the paw prints

We in the building, you niggas in apartments

No-now, c'mon, be my blood donor

Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her

Do it big, and let the small fall under that

Damn, where you stumbled out? From where they make gumbo at

Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack

But you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack

Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga, nothin' short of that

President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Tonight,



[Verse 2]

Dreads braided to the back,

I'm chilling but my swag on full attack,

And my girl acting like a brat,

So when she call, I don't answer I just write her back,

She hate it when I do that sh-t,

And I when get home she go through my sh-t,

She call numbers back to see who that is,

Man I hate it when she do that sh-t,

Polo t-shirt, polo draws,

Now make me take this polo off,

Girl you can get broken off,

Yeah I f-ck you for an hour then I smoke it off,

Swimming trunks and bathing suits,

They go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth,

Don't wanna fuss, aint tryna fight,

Man somebody tell em hoes I'm single for the night,



[Chorus]



[Verse 3]

Uhh, now she got on her f-ck em dress,

And I got on my double breast,

Uh, and he been fussing all day with her,

And I make her feel special like a place kicker,

She wanna be weezy f baby sitter,

Say she wish she could cut my d-ck off and take it with her,

I say hold on,

She say she just playing,

Then I falls in that p-ssy like quick sand,

Uh, hot sex and cold wine,

She left that n-gga hanging like a clothes line,

I cut my phones off, both lines,

It's bout to get nasty, pork rinds,

She came hard both times,

We both say we single,

And we both lying,

We both wrong but it feel right,

Put your hands up if you single for the night,

Put your hands up if you single,

Too hard to swallow
So we get high till it feel like the sky low

Ya'll boys just a bunch of pussy cats milo

Money is the song, pockets on high note

Do ra me faso

I rock like a fossil, big ball shit, Paul Castellano

Shoot ya ass up, now crawl out the condo

That's that nine nigga, lil rando

Sleeping with the enemy so I fuck the World

To Miss Louise Anna, the sweetest southern girl

The sweetest southern girl

This is times up

Put your signs up

Made em pick my dude

I'm the line up

Baby what the fuck is wrong (wrong) with them

What the fuck is wrong (wrong) with them

Very few are chosen

Looking at the wall

You can feel them close in

Baby what the fuck is wrong (wrong) with them

What the fuck is wrong (wrong) with them



[Lil Wayne:]

Uh, mind over matter

Money over all

The World is on my shoulders,

Shall I dust my shoulders off?

Uzi rat-a-tatter, knocking over walls

Fuck the bullshit, but just don't fuck it raw man

Pussy has a pattern and I know where I'm going

And if you got beef I turn into a tenderloin

Sanity kills so I live the crazy life

I wonder if you'll pay attention if I change the price

Life is my wife, till death do us part

Man I'm fly as fuck you ain't even next to depart

Quick draw McGraw, I hope you like art



[Chorus]



[Lil Wayne:]

Stepping on the bullshit

You can be my doormat

Y'all ain't going nowhere with that hatin' shit, four flat

Disrespectful on the beat, Borat

Fuck the system and the pussy wasn't all that

Who else really tryna fuck with Hollywood Cole? I'm with Marley G, bro

Flying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows

And I wanna tell you something that you prolly should know

This that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow

And uh, my real friends never hearin' from me

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me

That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused

I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews

We walk the same path, but got on different shoes

Live in the same building, but we got different views

I got a couple cars I never get to use

Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos

And these days all the girls is down to roll

I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole

Plus I been sippin', so this shit is movin' kinda slow

Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go



(Lil Wayne)



Now tell me how you love it

You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it

If you ain't runnin' wit it, run from it, motherfucker, all right

And I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig?

I got my gun in my boo purse

And I don't bust back, because I shoot first



Meet me on the fresh train

Yes, I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names

And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X Games

Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change

And I smoke 'til I got chest pains

And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James

Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne

I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin' plane

Skinny pants and some Vans

Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen

As the world spin and dance in my hands

Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand

Uh, wake up and smell the pussy

You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me

I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin' where it took me

Yeah, and I ain't a killa, but don't push me



Now tell me how you love it

Uh, how do he say what's never said?

Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red

Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg

Ma'fuckin' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade

Ball on automatic start

I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw

Wildcat offense, check the paw prints

We in the building, you niggas in apartments

No-now, c'mon, be my blood donor

Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her

Do it big, and let the small fall under that

Damn, where you stumbled out? From where they make gumbo at

Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack

But you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack

Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga, nothin' short of that

President Carter, Young Money Democrat

mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone

in this world of numbers I keep my nine on

and I don't go to church because the line long

and the preacher he be getting his shine on

but I know my Lord I am God's own

back to my hands, tick tick a time bomb

Flyer than Beetle Juice Beetle Jucie Beetle Juice

I got the floor I'm tryna see the roof

Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof

Blind eyes can look at me and see the truth

Wonder if Stevie do

But I'm a leave it to God not b but even u

Cause I'm a murder Y kill O and even U

Man I got summer hating on me cause I'm hotter than the sun

Got Spring hating on me cause I ain't neva sprung

While ya'll asshole niggas been on the same shit

Two words you neva hear, ""WAYNE QUIT? ""

Cause Wayne win and they lose

I call them April babies cause they fools

And when they snooze we UP

Feet up like a paraplegia

Or paraplegic or parallel park

In that red and yellow thang old skool Atlanta Hawk

Like I'm from Colli Park but I'm from Hollygrove

Now all my bloods scream Su-Woop and Da Da Doe

I know my role and I play it well

And I weigh it well on my libria scale

I suck a pussy fuck a pussy leave it there

Long hair don't even care

Ch-yeah!

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear

Queen B, as I share mic time, with my heir

Young Carter go farther, go futher, go harder

Is that not why we came?, if not than why bother?

Show no mercy in Murcielaga's

Far from being the bastard that Marcey had fathered

Now my name's being mentioned with the martyrs

The Biggie's and the Pacs the Marleys and the Marcus'

Govi got me a Molotov Cocktail

Flow even if you box well can't stop the blows

Ka-boom the Roc Boy in the room

The dope boy just came off the spoon

Also I'm so fly I'm on auto-pilot

While guys just stare at my wardobe

I see Euro's, that's right plural

I took so much change from this rap game

It's your go



HEY MR. Carter



[Verse 4:]

It's my go

And I'm a go so opposite of soft

Off the richter Hector Camacho Man Randy Savage

Far from average above status quo

Flow so pro I know I rise slow and win I pass

They say ""wat up killer man? "" stop bringing up my past

And next time you mention Pac, Biggie and Jay-Z

Don't forget WEEZY BABY!



[Chorus:]

Hey Mr. Carter (Amen)

Tell me where have you been (yea)

They been asking

They been searchin

They been wondering why (ha ha)

Hey Mr. Carter (Amen)

Hey Mr. Carter

They been asking

And I swear to everythang when I leave this earth

At the funeral parlor dripping tears down my sleeve

I go by them goon rules,

If you can't beat em, then you pop em,

You can't man em, then you mop em,

Looks like it's going to be a long day. (Ahh another one what we got?)

Originality (Ugh)

His flow is weak (Another one)

And he has no style (Ugh)

Whatcha got for um?



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Ok.Let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.

Dr.Carter to the rescue. Excuse me if I'm late,

But like a thief it takes time to be this great.

Ha! so just wait. Your style is a disgrace,

Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.

One, Uno, Ace and I'm tryin to make your heart beat like bass,

But your sweet like cake and I come to fix

Whatever you shall break. Where is your originality?

You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.

Capture What I say. All I need is one mic. All I need is one take.

Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.

Watch the gunplay like.No kidding. No kids in the way,

But the kids do watch. Gotta Watch what we say. Gotta work everyday.

Gotta not be Cliche.

Gotta stand out like Andre 3K.

Gotta kick it kick it like the sensai.

You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait...

Okay.

Respect is in the heart.

So that's where I'm a start.

And a lot of heart patients don't make it.

Now hey kids

Plural I graduated

Cause you could get through anything if Magic made it.

And that was called recycling

Or rereciting

Something cause you just like it

So you say it just like it.

Some say it's biting

But I say it's enlightning

Besides Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.

And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.

And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.

Authritist in my hand from writing.

But I'm a docter they don't understand my writing.

So I stop writing.

Now I'm like lighting.

And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titans.

Fast and exciting.

My Passion is Frighting.

Now let me put some more Vocab in your I.V.

Here take this Vicatin

Like it and love it

And confidence has no budget so pay me no mind I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit.

Take away the football team the basketball team now all we got is me to represent New Orleans.

No governor no help from the mayor jus a steady beatin heart and a wish an a prayer. Let's pray



[Robin Thicke:]

These friends they come and go but I got family. Family

Thes kids so fast they grow they learn so quickly now

That there's no where to go that there's no future future.

Don't make the sin so low and we kant over come now.

Tie my heands what are we gonna be what have I done so bad...

What is my destiny. Tell you tie my hands what am I pose to see

Whatever I don't surpass. What am I gonna b



[Lil Wayne:]

And if you come from under that water then that's fresh air

Just breathe baby Gods got a blessing to spare

Yes I know the presses is so much stress but it's the progress that feels the best

Kas I came from the projects strate to success and you're next so try

They kant steal your pride it's inside. Then find it and kepp on grinding

Kas in every dark cloud there's a silver lining I know.



[spoken:]

Yeh yeah yeah. See right now we jus ridin on love a shinin dark

We ain't tryna do nothing be at the heart.

We need love, that's all now



[Robin Thicke:]

Love will come, tie my heands what are we gonna be what have I done so bad...

What is my destiny. Tell you tie my hands what am I pose to see

Whatever I don't surpass. What am I gonna b



[spoken: Lil Wayne]

Born right here in the usa but due to tragdey looked on by the wole world as a refuge

So accept my emotion don't take it as an offensieve gestture

It's just the epitomy of my soul and I must b me

But got spirt ya'll. We got spirit we got sould ya'll.

We got soul they dnt want us to see but we already know"

So I'm not racing I'm just sprintin

Cause I don't wanna finish

They diminish I replenish

No homo, fingernails dirty

I've been counting dirty money since 12:30 A-M,

Wave them if they sure take them right back and spray him amen, yea, I just do my wayne and everytime I do it I do my thing, yea

Believe that like a true story

Rims big make the car look like it's two stories,

If I hop out - that be suicide

No back seats call that paralize

I don't have a spine I don't fantasize

I mastermine then go after mine

U see I handle mine I dismantle mine

I told her tool box bitch it's hammertime

So excuse me as I nail em to something

Just repeal em I'm kill em

Someone tell em that I'm a kill em

You Know Its Time That You Really Realize What This Family Is All About Cause About This Time Is When Your Gonna Be Able To Join In And Earn Some Real Money And Real Cash But Before You Do That I Wanna Teach You A Little Bit About Loyalty, The Main Name Of This Game Is Respect And Loyalty. Family Is A Big Thing When We Do This Kind Of Business Everything Is With Respect And When A Family Member Gets Outta Line And Another Family Dont Like It One Thing Leads To Another And The Next Thing You Know, Your Gone And Then Your Just A Memory Of Me, My Hearts Broke Then, But You Gotta Remember Theres Always Family And Loyalty, Loyalty Is The Main Thing. Obviously You Know I Dont Make My Money, I Dont Make All My Cash From Uh Construction Jobs We Do And Uh Sanitation And Private Stuff Is All Earned Money Through The Family And Since Your Of Age Now I Think Its Time I
Taught You What Coming Into The Family And Respect Is All About. So The First Thing You Gotta Learn Is The Name Respect, Tha Means You Dont Cross Nobody You Dont Go Over The Line, Once You Go Over That Line Theres No Coming Back Whether Youre A Member Of The Family Or Not. Thats When People Get Whacked And We Dont Want Nobody Whacked In Our Family So I Gotta Teach You The Proper Way Of Respect. When Youre Earning Money, Everybody Earns,Everybody Eats Bread. Its All About Cash Money Thats What Its All About Making The Money. So The First Thing Of Business Is This, You Remember Your Name, You Dont Forgets Your Roots. You Never Ever Disrespect Anyone Thats Above You Especially Your Capo Especially The Big Time Guys, Those Are The Guys You Listen To. You Never Ever Disrespect Anyone Unless Your Told To Unless You Get The Okay. And If There Is No Sit Down Theres Nothing"

I got the gun right beside me who don't?

Got beef homie I was just gettin' hungry

When you come bitch you better bring a army

We can do it in the streets and throw a gansgta party nigga

Why? Because...



[Chorus]



[Lil Wayne]

Thirty shots in the clip niggaz let's trip

Line 'em up put 'em down on the guest list

These niggaz 'bout to make me go Rambo

I'ma take the shit as far as it can go

War is the answer if ya questionin' the general

Snap shots at'cha baby you are just a centerfold

And less Kenneth Cole niggaz seem plenty bold

Pull that bitch out alright don't make me get my fishin' pole

Them niggaz hoes really doe

I would swing down there wit' any O Forty-Fo' and let 'em go

Let 'em know that I ain't never been sweet and won't be

Yes I'll be right here on the ground when you want me

Make a nigga have to come back like wit' the smack

Thomas bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact

And I ain't never killed no one jack

But I'm honest bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact

Why? Because...

I know some niggaz that'll merk ya for a quarter birdy
You bitch ass niggaz just be lucky that the boy ain't hurtin'
I got the money to lag and I got that swagger workin'

I'm smokin' somethin' I can't pronounce behind them Phantom curtains

What is you holl'in' bitch I'm on some gangsta shit

She wanna make me dinner I tell her make me rich

You fuckin' wit' a winner but I come from a little

Hoe but bet I can take that dirt and turn that shit glitter

I leave the work wit' her yeah she my baby sitter

And if I find out she stealin' for realer I'ma kill her

I'm just a money maaan so where the dollars at

??? beat that until them flowers black

She wanna ride on this I make her ride wit' that

Her pistol in the ceilin' that's her survival pack

And do I love her nawww man I just love her spirit

Blind deaf or crazy it's money over bitches



[Chorus - Lil Wayne - 2X]

Now everybody that I know get that money baby

And we ain't worryin' 'bout them hoes get that money baby

[Verse 2 - Birdman]

So get'cha game up take a bitch break a bitch

Strap her down wit' work and tell her don't trip take a trip

Get'cha hustle up the money's what you make of it

These niggaz want it cooked and I done closed down the bakery

So stop stuntin' homie false promotin'

It ain't about what'cha makin' it's about what ya totin'

Burn him up leave him naked bring him back to his wife

The bitch ain't even cry 'cause he was livin' that life

These niggaz think I'm slippin' 'cause I'm fallin' back

Bitch I got money in the walls for that

Young'n get it from the ground homie hold the hood down and

Don't make a sound if them people swing around this bitch

Do ya thang whoa' hustle try to stay low

This is for my old school G's who ain't around this bitch

But shawty they ain't fuckin' wit' pops

Let them niggaz chase that pussy we gon' follow that guap... yeah



[Chorus - Lil Wayne]



[Verse 3 - Birdman]

Fifty stacks in the garden in the backyard

Money talkin' turn a key into a crack charge

Y'all niggaz ain't eatin' how we eatin' B

Fuck how we used to be now we how we need to be

If they ain't wit' us they must be against us

We shoot 'em in the head 'cause they act like they senseless

If you ain't gettin' bread nigga keep yo' distance

We sharks over here nigga keep on fishin'



[Lil Wayne]

Money money money is my intuition

Money over bitches such an easy decision

Young Money money men monster militia

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Young desperado straight out the grotto
I'm so bad my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga but see me as a fuckin' rhino

Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano

It's a drought ain't it? How the fuck would I know?

Nigga I been gettin' my Cher in (share in) like Sonny Bono

I ran the streets... check my bio

I started high wit' two O's just like Ohio

I'm fuckin' nuts... cashews

But I'm so DC like fat shoes

I skate away... like later dudes!

Never get caught baby I'm mashed potato smooth

And just when it stopped... I made it move

Respect me nigga I'm a dog... no Asian food

I wet up the party so have a bathin' suit

And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga



[Chorus - Lil Wayne]

Keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'

And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit

My nigga... keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'

And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit

My nigga... 'Cause you aint really even 'bout all that

You ain't really even 'bout all that

And don't'cha forget.. I know ya you ain't 'bout all that

You ain't never been about all that... fall back



[Verse 2 - Fat Joe]

Niggaz must want Joey to lean on 'em

Flash the binky splash his dreams on 'em

Let 'em sleep on it it's nothin' to Crack

Lay the murder game down back to hustlin' packs

Yeah Weezy homie's got yo' back whether raps or macks

Either way they both spit like BRRRRAT!

Nigga... them muhfuckas is broke like them levies

And we done sold so much dope ain't shit you tell me

Nigga... how you want it ??? coke or dog food?

My shit'll have you runnin' naked like an old school

And yeah we 'bout it 'bout it and you ain't ridin' on me

Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal warmin'

And I'm a rider homie and you can find it on me

That 40 cal'll get you ???

This shit is funny to me

All these niggaz frontin' war but they runnin' from me... Crack!



[Chorus - Lil Wayne]



[Verse 3 - Birdman]

I had 'em as lil' niggaz raised 'em 'round real niggaz

Poppin' bottles fuckin' wit' them bitches nigga

Made money to the ceilin' me and my young nigga

Chillin' I'm in the streets hustlin' gettin' money nigga

Changed all my new shoes nigga got some new tools

Nigga got some mo' jewels we was gettin' money

And ain't nothin' ever changed still doin' the thang

Still gettin' money still spendin' change

We hustlin' from Sunday to Sunday

And we grindin' everyday like the money ain't comin'

Nigga... yeah we ridin' woodgrains and minks

Got the dope in the Hummer cold case for that thang

I hate the law for what they done did they broke in niggaz cribs

Wish I woulda caught 'em I'dda split they fuckin' wig

I want to throw up like chips in Vegas

But this is Southern face it

If we too simple then y'all don't get the basics

We won, we won 
And then we shot that BB gun 
And they lost, and they lost 
Til we took they shit, now its time to floss 


22 year old 17 war vet 

Life in the fast-lane, little red corvette 

Little red handkerchief, hangin out the right side 

Back pocket jeans fallin, Couple my evisu signed 

Yep we do shine, and they gon' hate 

But they hated Jesus baby we won't break 

So we ride like 4 Pirelli's 

So secured no security, no protectin no comparing 

Lok and heavy, Ocean 11 

Aviators, both tickers, so figures 

No playas, I'm Hollygrove to the heart 

Hollygrove from the start 

Don't cross Earhardt 

Boulevard where the ward I come from

Brrrt Brrrt! Pop Pop! Clap Clap! 

What the fuck, Hollygrove stand up Nigga!

Get 'em get 'em Weezy hit 'em where you kill 'em easy 

Sit em in the river, leave em, they find em tomorrow evening 

Sinkin or probly drinkin that syrup 

Thinkin I won't slip, even though I'm leanin like a broke hip 

He don't know I got the nina wit the 4 clip 

Thats a somersault back spin full flip for ya? 

Push this button, I flip out and hit something 

Miss nothin i'm just bustin until this scene clean 

12 hundred for the jeans stop playin 

Hundred dollars for the glock in my pants 

Who the man? I am when I stand with it pointed right at ya face 

Knock the brains from the back of ya neck for lack of respect 

I- strap a jet black gat 'til the deck 

Tell the mama to bury me with that, No Bullshittin' 

My hood getting kinda crazy where I be 

So Ronie's with me cuz he's the OG

Fresh out the back seat of the figgity phantom 

The haters I make em mad em when I wave at em like what up?! 

If it ain't about money I keep goin 

I tryna get that green, niggas tryna mow my lawn 

But Fuck, them boys I got the shottie on my arm 

If them boys run up I leave their bodies on the lawn 

And Duck the fuck out a there, cuz baby its hot out there 

If this was a movie it's time to roll the credits, cut! 

Its all over, all of ya brains is all over the motherfuckin' block! 

I'm a motherfuckin' rock!

Yea I'm in the backseat still got the seat back

Feet back stay from where the fake be at

Niggaz snitch for the shine where the patience at

Nigga make his own brother face his back

Give love and take it back

Good grief man this world is quite heavy on my aching back

Cops killing for crack you know the story snakes eat rats

Face the facts you can't change him can't shoot it if you can't aim it

Can't miss him if he kill you then you can't blame him

That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade him

Get too deep up in that water and they can't save ya

Me I come out of that water like I was just bathing

And watch my step on a wet pavement

Yea I'm from the hood so I rep 'em where I can't take em

Holly Grove Holly Grove was his last statement

So nigga get that look off your face

And recognize you got a crook in the place

They call me W-E-E crooked letter Y I'm so high

I skeet skeet in any nigga dime like she's mine

Streetsweeper in the back of the hatch make me pop the latch

Leave you bloody with the cops to match

Bullet holes in ya from the chopper blast

Like... Ha ha

That's bullet holes in your sneakers got you hoppin back

It all stop when they hit you in ya top and back

No cocking back silly motherfucker you ain't heard bout this

The clip sink down to the dick

That's a automatic shotty from a drum they call tommy

Garunteed to get you bitches from by me

When I hit every piece of ya physical body he leakin'

Mortimer is no longer leapin' he sleepin'

While you pussy niggaz is sleepin he thinkin

Deep in thought the boy ain't even linkin

Bob Marley got me stinkin

Stackin figures I'm standin firm life's a slinky

Pipes is filled with crack cocaine

And the dope go inside of the veins from where I came

Though I bear a name only one call live with

Coach they won't knock me off my pivot forget it

I'm sicker with it

Pick a city buy a condo find a fine hoe let some time go chill

What you know about a bongo having her mind goOver a convo about dough

Nothing! Man the four wheelers look so good on the sand

Tee or tanktop pocket fan

Pocket knife no handgun in sight

Just that rat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat BOOM!

Ha ha tonight I might just boost my feature price

Cuz to each its own and the lights is bright

And I'm feelin like Mike at a Tyson fight

I'm from Cita house big momma's house

She told me to shoot ya right after I knock ya out

And he ain't gettin up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot

Hold up the beat might drop

Yeah I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpit

We so out of it, zero tolerance

Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it

I'm wealthy, still fuckin wit that block shit

Wet your ass up, head to feet til your sock a drip

Don't strip, you might fall and bust your ass

No snakes at the carter, tell the gardener to cut the grass

I hear 'em but they talking under mass

Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass

That's Cash Money, honey pie

We ain't runnin, we don't hide sayin fuck the other side

Don't get caught on it, this the dailiest grind

I'll put your heart on it and walk on it

The chalks only for the art homie

How they trace ya after I erase ya

Look around, we at war and you still in preparation

I'm riding for them reperations, No patience

Slow paper is better than no paper

Fast money don't last too long, you gotta pace it

You gotta know that paper

If you got it from a caper, you gotta blow that paper

Gotta know that photo fobia, no kodak moments

Feds walls with my pictures on 'em

Nah, I ain't even in the school yearbook

I don't do too much posin, got a cool killer look

Career crook, get your career took

I'm back like a brizeer hook

Bitch cheer, camoflauge gear, the hunter's here

Better play it by ear, you ain't nothing but a deer

Around here and this here is The Carter

Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama

And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter

But get your boys some different sauce, I want the whole enchilada

I got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em

On the head at the bottom

You ain't gotta shoot 'em cause I already shot 'em

And I ain't gotta get 'em cause I already got 'em

Get 'em"

Sister or a brother and you lookin like a mother

I took you from a clubber to a lover

And you took another bitch husband

The other bitch wasnt doin shit for him

She say she did too much, I say she did nothin

She need to quit frontin

Cant hide ya feelings, can't let my pride conceal it

So no time for groupies, straight to the top flo'

Fresh out the shower, a smile and a towel

Then after an hour, she gon need another shower

I'm at home or in the coupe or in the office

Or the streets or in the booth, thinkin bout you

And, most of the girls that come by are cute

And they try to holla but they all on mute

And, my old girls turn they face up at me

And, they thrown they purses and they make up at me

Cuz you got Wayne, I charge it to the game

Come home smellin food on the stove

She done cleaned the whole house

Washed the dishes and the clothes

And we out we do it just how we supposed

Look good for the public leave the drama in the Rolls

Royce, choice of car dat we move

And she gets high sometimes 'cause I'm always doin' it

You hear them hallways we always doin it

Work cut, always feel like the first one

Perfect, when a nigga stressed off dat work shit

Take away all the pain, make it lesser than dirt

That's why you got Wayne, I charge it to the game

[Chorus]



[Lil Wayne]

8 AM open my eyes

Yeah kick my bitch tell her open the blinds

Yeah I'm cookin breakfast for the block then I let her cook mine

Yeah quick line in the bathroom before we bounce

Not me I mean her she go a day a ounce (damn)

Y'all pray for her

While I'm at the bus station in the Bently sittin' low as I wait for ya

I'm gettin' dough I'm a paper---boy I will take ya

For the right paper--boy I will take her

Shake her--tape her--waist up

Send her to the money she be back before I wake up

Get cha cake up

Y'all niggaz lame ducks

Hot boy flame up

You niggaz tryin to change up and I'm gettin my change up

So Lil Wayne, what's your motivation?
(Wayne)
Is that really a question? Do you really have that written down in your notepad?
You should be ashamed of yourself. You smell me girl, I smell like money
See, that's what they don't understand, to me, it was always get money or die

I come up under Birdman, Number One Stunna knowhatimean?

I'm Stunna Junior, and that's all I know, that's all I ever knew

Get money or get nuttin, knowhati'msayin?

And I feel that way, forreal



So hard I go, I keep pushin

The games so crazy, I'm in it like deep pussy

I got chips, I'm tryin to get the whole cookie

Used to make a thousand dollars every time I played hookie (YEA!)

Dwayne Carter absent, keep lookin

I'm present on the block, I'm a legend on the block (YEA!)

Ice so bright, like heaven on the watch

Yea nigga I done dropped one eleven on the waaatch (ugh)

So waaatch and see what I do

Breeze by ya so fast, gotcha sneezin, hachoo!

They got the shivers, man I got the fever

I gotta bring the hood back after Katrina!

Weezy F Baby, now the F is for Fema

Sick nigga, bitch I spit that leukemia (Bitch!)

Yea, no cure, no help

So me, so good, so hard, so felt, FEEL ME!



(Wayne)

And that's just my point right there

that's what I'm always tryin to stress, knowhati'msayin?

If you don't understand me, if you don't feel me

then you ain't real, in my eyes

And that's all that count to me, you know?

(Woman)

So, is your music considered the voice of urban America, or America period?

(Wayne)

I mean, I would say, the voice of the hood, cause that's who I speak for

And myself, knowhatimean my family, that's who I represent

My homies, my girl, my life, ya know?



Bang this shit, nigga, pump my shit

Gotta bang that wimp, and go and dump that bitch

You gotta go and claim that strip and go and flood that bitch

You got aim that shit and straight bust that shit

Like muthafuck them niggaz, what they wan do, I'm ready

Tethered camo, no homo, black Rambo

Fuckin wit the boy, baby that's a gamble

If we were in Vegas, leave 'em on the crap table

I'm willin and I'm able to come and run up in ya stable

Like nobody make a sound, where the paper, where the paper?

Gotta get it, gotta have it once I got it, I'ma spend it

He's back from doin any damn thing just to get it

The re-ups be like birthday party

No room to park the cars in the garages

So outside the cribs all you see is the roggies

If I ain't say it right, fuck it, I ain't foreign FEEL ME!



(Wayne)

Ya see, that's where everybody get me wrong, knowhatimean

I got that heat rock, forreal

(Woman)

Why do you think that other rappers lack the impact of your music?

(Wayne)

That's because they ain't got that heat rock like me, knowhatimean?

They ain't spittin like me, they spittin, but, knowhatimean, they ain't got colds

I got the flu over here man, forreal, I need relief. Ya'll help me, forreal

(laughing) I know y'all sick of me, cause I'm tired of y'all, forreal



And based on the bank, I'm doin much better than a lotta of these niggaz

I'm tired of these niggaz

Yawnin when I see em', make me stretch and pull the burner

I'm cockin back and passin, they catch it 'em in they sternum

Ohhh ohhh, that gon prolly burn ya

That gon prolly learn ya, to never ever ever (What?)

Ever ever ever, come around here no more

Rich gangstas over here, you gotta die when ya broke BITCH!

I'm the God, I should ride wit the Pope

But the boy's so hood, I just ride wit my ho (YEA!)

Yea, and tell about Hollygrove

Tell about my last show, tell about my last ho

You know, just born to mack

Call me Deion Sanders bring the corner back (YEA)

I'm in my prime, niggaz fallin back

That's right, I'm comin baby, yea, hard as crack, FEEL ME!



That's just what it is, if you don't like my shit

then fuck you and your shit, man straight up

That's how I was taught, that's how I was brought up

that's how I'ma go down man, forreal

Thooouugh, though I'm missin you [straight to the head man]

I'll find a way to get through

I know livin without ya is impossible [yea]

Gooonnee...I know you gon live on [cry momma, ya momma]

Cuz you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya



(Verse 1)

Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya

He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya

Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to

It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor

Standin on stage in front of thousands

Don't amount to me not havin my father

That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em

But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em

And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all

Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard

I'm alright God, shit I'm still breathin

But lose hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin

Throw me down some comfort, cause my heart need it

Tryin to cope wit my chances and meet 'em

There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin to take it easy

Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my nigga



(Chorus) [Lil Wayne simultaneously in the background x 2]

but I'm a soldier, so I gotta over, can't stay sober, I'm just tryin to get over]



(Verse 2)

Smoke cush all day and pop painkillers

Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us

This what the streets showed us

This how the block made us, the same block where they layed 'em

I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me

Lord will I be next for the taking? Take me

I know I'm livin like I know when I'm comin

But I'm just livin cause I know that it's comin

And the end is comin, but I ain't runnin

I and hidin and duckin, I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it

I'm just speakin from the heart of the diein public

We still beatin, we gon rise above it

Though it seem like they cheatin and we loosin

We survive if nothin, they could never take the stride from strugglin

I gotta ride

And sometimes that ride get bloody

But I just think about my buddy and go after that money, but uhh..



(Bridge) Nikki [Lil Wayne simultaneously in the background]

Ohhh, we gotta get over, we gotta get over, gotta get over

it's almost over, and we gon be alright

[I gotta get over, I gotta get over, cause bitch I'm a soldier]



(Verse 3)

Straight Patrone out the bottle to the head now

We gettin read now, bitch my nigga dead now

And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now

I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds

Now I gotta walk around, brim down

Just tryin to find my way to the next day, escape

Ya birthday could be ya death date

So I'm livin like it was just yesterday, let's pray

Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together

It's murda murda, I don't think it get better

So be a competitor or get out the weather

Me? I got a umbrella and a berretta

I'm just tryin to make sure my daughter future progressin

And behind that, I'm shootin excessive, trust me

The beautiful dead, we livin wit the ugly

I just tell my pops wait for me, I'm comin

They ask me why I wear shades at nighttime...cause I don't wanna see nothin! Yea..

[Verse 1]

I got the game on ball and chain

I threw the key in the train

I'm like the key in the truck

I spent a G on these frames, though my vision is priceless

Seeing through you niggaz like a fuckin psychic

Hearing through the grapevine, niggaz wanna hate mine

Say my name and die in the daytime

You catch my drift, man you better be Peyton

Boy the heats on, they make a peace bond

I'm in this bitch, throwing up the seventeenth sign

Straight frowns, no daps, strapped three times

A Tec-11, AK 47, one Beretta, ready for whatever

Tell them pussy niggaz come together

Heavy wetter, nigga super soaker wetter, nigga

Six feet under flowers, you ain't nothing but a petal nigga

I'm just a little nigga, trying to be a civil nigga

Thirty years old, shit that'll be a different nigga

Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listenin

But she ain't really trippin, 'cause the pots is piston

Them niggaz trippin, unitl the shots whistling'

Hear them bullets sizzle, like a cobra at attention

I gotta bitch, and quit callin women bitches

As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen

No preventing the crime, I gotta get it

I'm admitted to the game, true playa, no quittin

There you go shittin on a way a nigga thinkin

Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin

And since the future ain't promised to no one

I live everyday like this is the sure one

Train in the tidal wave, this is the ocean

Stand in the heat, 'til the mother fuckin snow come

And it feels so fuckin good

Throw my dope like a rope, let them tug and pull

No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches

Runnin cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune

Come and get it, automatics in motion

We bangin for the bread nigga, even the molded

I got my loaf, I got my toast

Chaperone of the south, I got my coast. Yea

And unll I die I'm Da. Da Da Da Da. Da BEST RAPPER ALIVE"

Any drama I pace it like Indiana, I take your grandma pacemaker and jus handle the piece

Not two fingers I simultaneously bout two bangers

You do not want anger USDA prime beef, ya dead meat

And I'm a fool wit the flame and the caine

Young Wayne and the pain and the stain still remain

On the chest where the four made a mess yes

And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid

Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head

Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead

Only follow the code of the streets

Live bad to die good

Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food

But just so I can eat

And ain't it a bitch

And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich

And you probably can see me for some crack before six

And after that it's all bricks

A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight

And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam

I skate with the bomb

I'm asking you don't play with me at all

Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all

It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints

Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit

Fit for two clips

The kid is a nuisance

Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music

And the Blueprint

Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit

The Caddi do me pop, the coupe is hot

the groupies flock, and case me out my Gucci socks

Yeah, we get that dough, Tatee' watch me drop these

You got me, can I get the car keys



[Baby]

See I wipe a bitch down, then dribble on a hoe

And I touch her from her head, from her waist, to her toes

Pop up in the Lexus with the mink on the floor

Rocked out Nexus 2K bird hoe, Wooo!

Gagging and choke like ho put the dick back in your throat
Still packing fo sho

Bars got cheese I got cheddar linguini

That's why I keep the federals scheming

That's why I keep the platinum blinging

Every diamond's like a nice size

I help people with problems look at the bright side

With nice ties on a rise so they sitting me high

And the rims born in '79

Slipping they gon have to get six niggaz name called carry a pine box

Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby

What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings

and z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens

You need to see Wheez - anything you like and I have 'em

From crack to Viagra, and Vicadins valiums

I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av

So get all your money together, come and get my slabs

I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half

And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'

And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid

For the white people, when I get you bricks for ten, I know the right people

And I keep a nine on my waistline

And I'ma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind



[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]

I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""

You see me hustlin' on the block all the time

Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes

Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine

Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind



I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""

You see me hustlin' on the block all the time

Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes

Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine

Nigga, I'm on the grind



[Lil Wayne]

Nigga, y'all gon' respect Wheezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots

I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', ""Stop!""

I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed

On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee

And if we beef, we don't beef long 'cause we gon' creep all night

So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night

Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes

'cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes

And the bricks move every followin' week

So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d

And I shower your streets until your av pass out

More bricks than the three of your pigs' last damn house

Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts

And issue work for half and just grab that south

For real, nigga - Wheezy Whee tryin' to shine

From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind

Nigga, I'm on the grind



[Lil Wayne]

I start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's

Take seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks

Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it

Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it

And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue

And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move

Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose

Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'ma tax a dude

Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma

Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour

I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss

Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss

Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun

All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run

I'm tryin' to get rich 'cause I wan' shine

You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time



[Hook-4x]

[Lil Wayne]

I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""

You see me hustlin' on the block all the time

Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas

Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas

How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it

Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin

Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin

They dressin' in black, prepared for combat

Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks

Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust

You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out

Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave

Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef

Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, ""Juvenile, stay off them streets.""

I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me

I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets

A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', ""Fuck the police!""

Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east

Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself

In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health

I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck

My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up

Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's

Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed

All they understand is my project English

And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis

Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga

Better know that I'm a snake, and I'ma sneak ya, nigga

Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas

Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga

Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas

Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas

And empty a hundred out that K

Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me

I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter

Young mobster, wild and obnoxious

Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy

Glock cookin', boy

I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy

Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'

Spark or lace somethin'

Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'

Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America

And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible

If I live to be old, it's a miracle

'cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical 

That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo

Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you

Don't blame me, society changed me

You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar

Cut off lights, we masked riders

The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake

With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

I know, I know, Weezy Wee, this dedicated to my father
Damn nigga, y'all excuse the expressions
What it be like up there baby boy, ay this here ya son hollerin at ya
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya

But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin

Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin

Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit 

Just let him know I'm still young and at risk

Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin herb in the house

I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out

But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time

Told me get the paper instead of high

So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog

I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog

I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me

But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me

And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin

And I'm a make you even happier, I promise



[Chorus 2x]

I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know

But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know

But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep

But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog



I know you see my daughter growin up and bad as ever

But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her

And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman

I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin from nothin

B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child

Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile

And me I'm on some ""squash it"" and some debate it

But I know they love it way more than they hate it

And I know you probably laughin at the way I treat these hoes and these 

bitches

I try love 'em, my BM be trippin

But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective

That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection

And you see I left school behind and chose CMB

It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough

And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely

Watch over me my nigga, just guide me



[Chorus]



I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you

'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you

Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes

Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog

I promise I won't ever put nothin above you dog

So I live my life in dedication of you dog

I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within

Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again

But I know they got a reason why I'm here

And I know they got a reason why you gone

And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own

But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart

I can't forget you kept it real from the start

And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me

And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me

And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said ""thay's my peoples""

Watch over me nigga 'til I see you

And if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off

And if you wonder who the fuck (?)

(?) we so sip

It's like ain't nothin' but we gotta squab

On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit

Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick

We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it

Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it

Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid

Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs

Ain't nothin' sweet 'cause I can't keep trust

Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga

Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga

Pullin' out the K's, nigga - (??) and all

Wayne 'bout to damage your home

Nigga 'bout to go to see the man in the stars

Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all

Cannons went off

News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your avenue's gone

Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain

How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame

That's because she ran into the game

Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne

Come on!



(Hook [Lil Wayne])

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was

I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge

Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load

and the slug check ya low when I bust

Come to show you no love

Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now

No! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now

Stop playin' when ya get it understood

'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya

Come around your hood for ya

You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love

You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya

Iceberg shorty dammit, pants is saggin', forty magnum

Comin' out the club on Bacardi's, staggerin'

Ten in the Ferrari wagon, braggin'

Ohh, what's happenin'?

(??) 'round the court 'cause some ex just looked at me

Runnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic

Nigga put a cap in your asses

Catch me on the av with the crack and a 'matic

Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it

First of the month, just snatched me a package

Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'

If a nigga think about jackin', please believe

I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'

Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents

Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him

Shit get drastic

That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could

Grab me a freak to ease on my wood

Transport coke from each of my hoods

Wheezy Whee - CMB's in my blood

In the streets seventeen's where I'm from

And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens

Really, though, fetticheese is my love

You know the streets made me

And I don't give a damn if you hate me

Nigga better be S-Q-A-D

Until the bigger man do take me

Squad shit!

You don't want no violence to keep the quiet

We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet

or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma

So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence

Come on! What!

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was

It's too dark for ya's

I ain't got no love for ya's

Who fuck with us?

Wet a nigga like umbrellas

Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man

Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man

Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm

If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it

Niggas be kiddin' - me awake, deal away

gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face

Oh, shit - niggas on that whole shit

Fours spit so quick like that lil' nigga ain't got no sense

Wipe off your family randomly - ya understand?

Come on!



(Hook [Lil Wayne])

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was

I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge

Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load

and the slug check ya low when I bust

Come to show you no love

Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now

Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now

Stop playin' when ya get it understood

'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya

Come around your hood for ya

You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love

You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya

Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now

Them can't fuck with me now - ah, they can't fuck with me now

Look-

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was

I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge

Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load

and the slug check ya low when I bust

Come to show you no love

Ah, fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now

They can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now

Stop playin' when ya get it understood

'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya

Come around your hood for ya

You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love

You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya

Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now

Them can't fuck with me now - no, they can't fuck with me now

Really dont care how short how plump, short or thick

Give me head, Don't care, Swallow cum don't spit

Aww shit, I like them Jamicians and them Hatians

Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em

White girl's I video tape 'em and they enjoy it

They love it when everybody saw it

High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brain

But watch them hoes who want the change

Bounce for ya hood, Shake for ya baby daddy

Twerk for that nigga who got you pregnant in the Caddy

Slide with the KY, Hold up ???

My bitch got thong, You bitch got drawls

My chick like to swallow, Yo chick like to spit

If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch

Hold up, Chill out, Wait a minute stop

My Ginseng, Viagra, and a Strawberry pop

See I'm feelin' kinda bold, Why don't ya bring a friend

From vigina to the asshole do it again

Yo mama loved a Tymer, Now you welcome

Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust things
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains

Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames

My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne

I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy

Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it

One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven

Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready

Come and get it - it's Wheezy Whee, the hottest ever

Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater

I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama

And tomorrow I'ma hit the block and barrow your momma

Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas

Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers

And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali

When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people

Seventeen creeper is who I - what I - be, dog

The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five

In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog

On four tires, or feet, dog

I still be on the block sweepin'

Nobody is not sleepin'

Got me in all black with a gun in a palm

Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome

Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff

cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump

and passin' a blunt - me circle, wants to see if he dead

Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead

But, dog, you get it raw if you are with the kid

I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge

On the back street of your block in the back seat

I'ma cap three at the first coward I up and see

I'ma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet

When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach

Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday

Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust

Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff

Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed - add it up

Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up

Crack in the tongue of my kicks

Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip

I know you see me: Little Wheezy killaholeezy

A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy

You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes

Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know

Huh? Huh? Huh?

And i'm suppose to be a player for life, but i'll change for ya

'cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out

The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump

You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front

I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump

So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump

I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow

Unlike no other, I'm real (??) like bag 'Bauds

I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes

I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow

I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4

The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow

Is that so?



[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]

I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog

That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all

If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by

That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die



[Lil Wayne]

Look,

Which one of these niggas playin' with me?

I'ma strap up and slam his parent's street

When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats

I be damned if he get a chance to sleep

I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree

I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me

Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease

There has to be some explanation for this insanity

Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)

Now give me the dank

Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank

What's your kid gonna think?

Come home and find your wig in the sink

I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti

For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it

I lock my area down - you can ask these boys

They know Wheezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys

Never catch me (??) without them plastic toys

It get drastic, boy

Niggas that's askin' for it

Wheezy, nigga

It's Wheezy, nigga

Who? Wheezy, nigga

It's Wheezy, nigga



[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]

I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog

That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all

And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by

That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die



[Lil Wayne]

I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'

Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open

Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows

Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes

Two pistols, desperado gun busta

Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya

Hung under them killers and duck the pigs

And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big

And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick

'cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks

I sticks to what I love, and that's the street

And stay away from what I hate, and that's police

And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'

And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'

When we all knowin' that Wheezy have never been fake

The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face

Who is Wheezy, nigga?

Who is Wheezy, nigga?

Wheezy, nigga

Lil Wheezy, nigga



[Hook-2x]

[Lil Wayne]

Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog

That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all 



[Lil Wayne (talking)]

It's Wheezy, nigga - Lil Wheezy, nigga

Don't tangle it, nigga

It's time to step down, ya heards me"

Huh
What?
What?
Let's go, nigga (Where you at, Wheezy?)



You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick 

or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick

And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas

We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons

We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats

Stormin' through the house, screamin', ""Where's this bastard's crack?!!""

I flash the Mack in front of your gal and make her tell

Like, ""Slut! Where's the yay, or I'ma pop one in your grill!""

It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas

Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas

I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga

Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga

If you out, you can find me on the street with the work

If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work

Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt

And put your whole clique deep in the dirt

Smell me?



[Hook-2x (Lil Wayne)]

Who wan' beef with 'em?

Who wan' creep with 'em?

And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em

See, we can sweep with 'em 'cause it get deep with 'em

And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em



[Lil Wayne]

I'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters

Let my nine-millimeters kill your peoples

Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita

Give me the yay, or else I'ma put her in her sneakers

Wow (wow, wow) you can catch me in all black with no smile

Me, Turk, G'z and ouch - chicka-POW!

How come these niggaz keep burnin the world

and why the hell this nigga Weezy keep firmin your girl?

Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal, Bentley drop

Then I'ma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block

Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em

When you see them bullets that my glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em

See this for all my niggaz in the pen, I hope for freedom

And this for all my niggaz buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper

Keep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come

Wayne #1 Hot Boy, hot as the sun - ya smell me?



[Hook]



[Lil Wayne]

Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place

Blast the face, automatic attach to waist

You bastards play? Then it get awful and bad

There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head

A nigga either gon' get it right, or they get it at night

And when they spit it, lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice

Henny and ice is what I prefer but light on the rocks

I pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your blocks

And if there's, coke involved then your throat's involved

I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all

Me and my nigga Super Sosa, run up in your crib

while your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her

If you (?) chances slim like Ethiopia

If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia

Recognize it's real and nuttin udder than that

Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?

Got a early call from Kisha
Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then l'm gone be there
What would be a good time to reach ya

She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter

Cuz she wanted me to see her

And told her come pick me up

As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis

Ate it up like some peanuts

I said oooohhhh Kisha

She drunk it like a 2 liter

She blow like a pro

Oh no I got to keep her

She was a fool with it

Cuz she knew what to do with it

So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly

Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees

She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk I know she ain't got no wores

But she told me she'd do a damn job on them boys

She provided the number later on gave her a call

Told her what I was thinkin and she was down with it all

Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin tall

What she'll do to a nigga she'll be against the law

That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss

Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall

Hit the spot run in his house

And make 'em show up then thangs

And then blow up his brain

And watch they partner get lit up

All I was taught was murder murder

Kill drama, and nothin' less

I strap tha Smith-Wess, and bust.. it in they chest

I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle

Had ta struggle for success

Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks.. under they dress

Them niggas there with me fooli'

Me, I'm full of that dilly

Hope when I catch them slippin'

Him and they daddy's trippin'

Shorty can hold it down

Shorty be totin' rounds

Smellin' like a pound on school grounds

Shorty, wow

Hair... all over my head

Bandana 'round my brain

Eyes bloodshot red

Briches down to my legs

Guns up in my trench

When niggas playin', they get drenched

My pockets is full of lead

So, nigga, stay off tha ben

I'm young with bad nerves

Since I lost my partna, I've been troubled, hurt in this 'burb

So I'on't even hesitate ta leave 'em on tha curb

And wet dem niggas' shirt

Nigga, get 'em full of birds

Tell them niggas, Geezy!



[Chorus, B.G.]

Remember he? Tha little G, never die

Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die

Remember he? Tha little G, never die

Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die

Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack

Weezy Wee roll with K's, glocks, and MAC's

Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real

That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga



[Lil' Wayne]

Look, look

That time I forgot tha bills

Ain't been home in two weeks

Macita lookin' for me

Tha word all over tha streets

Well, shiiit! I love my momma

But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems

I lay back in tha cut

These niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here

We all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here

Tha lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow

I can't see it, I'ma drop my pile on tha floor

They got some niggas stuntin' in Benz, hey man, them boys ain't riders

{gun cocks} Hand it over, partna, my feet done got tired (Break it off)

Well, picture this, I gotta corner this ole nigga address

He said he got that work, and needed me ta meet 'im there (Meet him there)

Nigga, take your Roly down with somethin' shady, daddy (What?)

Within a week he changed his mind, and... received tha package (What?)

Oh well... back to tha drawin' board (Board)

Cowards start hollerin' 'cause they know I'm comin' for it

[Lil' Wayne]

Lemme tell 'em

You remember that there nigga use ta be thuggin' it out

Blunt in his mouth, would stay passed up in a drought

Run in your house, ""Lay down! Nobody move!

Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!""

That's how it was... crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs

Lots of thugs... make niggas come ta answer them up

Some niggas choose ta come back to me, ride around my set for me

My lights off that thing 'cause I got that SKS with me

!Okay! (!okay!)

Listen, all you ballin' niggas betta !relocate! (!'locate!)

'Cause, see, ya'll got it

So just give me with whatever you have, my stomach hurt, I need a bag

Don't hate on me boy if you do *pow* get down

Come from under my shirt try to lift you off the ground

But on the other hand, I'ma keep running man

I got about a hundred coming up with three Hummers man

We stuntas man

I might stumble across a grand and give it to you wifey

And watch how she *slurp* on my pipey like a Icee

I might be in a Range that night

I might be in a Lex watching the game tonight

I got a hundred on Kobe, hope he playing it right

But if I lose, its cool, that's some change lil shite

That ain't nothing

I ain't doing nothing if I, I ain't stunting

Hold up, girl be quiet, Lil Wayne coming.



[Baby]

Slow yo roll lil one

You ain't glad its bought

And Ms. Pat and gray head over there

In the back card gambling

At the bar dranking

But go head, just be quiet with ¡®em lil one



[Lil Wayne]

Broads I use ¡®em

Hatas I bluse ¡®em

My whole front grill is full of confusion

Got dammit

Soon as I left the scene, the women vanished

I got it like that

Got Rolex, blue shit hard to say watches

Plus I bought all of my niggas Cartier watches

Weezy and his clique leave with forty b-e-atches

Million dolla man baby tear da beasy

Catch me sippin on some Hen, maybe Covoursier

Tell yo girl hello

Pull yo pants up on yo ass and put that piece of metal up in yo shirt

Don't make me get up out this wheel chair and kick yo ass

Now keep doing what you doing

Shut off the lights

Roll down the windows 

Turn the corner

Shoot out the street lights

Send chills up my trigga finger, blast tha dummy

Take tha hit, even if it's below tha average money

Got to make it through tha week, and feed my family uppy

Just lost my father last year
But I still, remain to keep it real like dollar bills
I drop tears, can't believe my daddy's gone
Rather come home, why ya left us all alone?
But I'm comin man

Just wait at the gates, I'ma be runnin man

Arms open, eyes wide, full a love

You watched me come up from a scrub

Now ya see ya son ridin everyday on dubs

But I wish, I could share them times wit' you

It got me pissed, this family and my momma, too

But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne

And see ???, Mrs. Roe, Sheryl, Kemp and plus Sinetra

Dawg, we really miss ya

And it ain't all that cool livin off pictures

Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me

Can't believe you left me to be a small man

But I know it wasn't meant to be

That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me



[Hook 2x]

It's up to you, Wayne, nigga, stay up and keep it real

It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel

Just be strong, 'cause everythang gon' be alright

I know it's hard tryna make but it's gon' be alright



Alright I know it, see I got a child

I know I'm young, but when you left dawg, thangs got wild

I know you probably sayin 'damn, you raisin children now?'

But it's all gravy I'm with Baby makin millions now

So I still smile

I'm takin care ya wife brah

Ain't nothin changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss

But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'

Thangs go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though

So you know who payin the bills now, ah hah

Still flossin, give my audience the chills, ah hah

I got all my game from you, man I ain't gon' lie

But I'm still thuggin nigga, playa you think I ain't gon' ride?

But Slim and B done slowed me done and brought the talent out me

And I ain't goin' no where, that nigga stuck wit' me

And make you and my people happy, man it's up to me

I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind

I know ya see me everytime watchin the boys shine

And I know that ya see I put out my own CD

And picture this, your little boy even on TV

But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy

Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me

I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me

And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me

Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby

Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy

But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry

And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die

I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why

And ask him to bless your soul everytime I pass by

I know he doin' it, and leavin all the love to me

And I'ma prove it, and show ya daddy it's up to me
