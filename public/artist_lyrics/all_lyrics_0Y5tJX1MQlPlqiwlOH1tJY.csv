Neither a good one, nor is it so unblessed
It can change, it can stay the same
I can say, I can make my claim
Hail, hail, hail

Yeah, okay

This shit is outta control

I'm drivin' through Hell and I done brought snow

It's shinin' in here and I done brought glow

I hear the sirens right out the chateau, run me the info

Tryna hear what you did, not how you came close

'Cause I get bobblehead like I done made pro

I made Italian bread like I done made dough

I be all around the map

Write a show by myself like I'm Chelsea Handler

Or write a series 'bout my bitches like I'm Kelsey Grammar

Nicknamed the jet Jayhawk 'cause it's outta Kansas

You know it's Spaldin' in my top, I'm in my esperanza

You know it's slammin' wall to wall

We gotta fill the stands up, with slaps and the anthems

Poetic justice, I got you in all my stanzas

With your model stances, you everything I know about it (Ah)



Know about it, know about it

Know about it, know about it

Know about it, know about it

Know about it, know about it



What we know

Where you shall go

Power, ah



Uh, yeah

C-notes, B-notes, I took the biggest boat

We stayed down for life, it's like a jingle to do 'em all

We too much involved to spend a single ounce of time

She bust a whole ounce by doin' lines

I had to leave, like the leaves do trees

I'm finally home, I wiped the stress, then I touched that sweat

We took 'em 35 to 1 like this shit roulette

Hold up, beg your pardon, we done lit up, baby

Set up, told the preacher, ""Never finish,"" that's to say the least

Buy it, never lease it, but I gotta lease it

Mobile, Mona type of pieces, Met Gala, night Jesus

Skip it, hit the city, party pack, I got it with me

I'm shotty while I let you with me

I'm too bent to let you ride, barely 'til it's empty

Gotta feel me, pockets dumb fat and I got a skinny

Squad is with me, and that's everything I know about it



I know about it, I know about it

I know about it, I know about it

I know about it, I know about it

I know about it, I know about it

I know about it, I know about it

I know about it, I know about it



Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time

For y'all have knocked her up

I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe

I was not offended

For I knew I had to rise above it all

Or drown in my own shit"

Didn't like the way this shit went down at the awards, I admit it, turned to a beast

This that shit right here that get me goin', after I pop me a piece

You know they say you up when you finally free

It won't feel right if it's only me

If you're scared, nigga, say your grace

Look, tell me the stats whenever the smoke clear out of my face

Am I picture-perfect, or do I look fried?

All of that green and yellow that drip from your eyes is tonic

Tell you demise, I went to my side

To push back the ceilin', and push back the feelings, I had to decide

I replay them nights, and right by my side all I see is a sea of people that ride wit' me

If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child

The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me inspired (Hah)

Yeah, yeah

That shit wild, instead I'm a hero

I took it from zero, LaFlame you sayin'

I read it from miles, this shit wasn't love

They got me fucked up, I put you on bust and take you around

A couple of guns inside of that school, I gave 'em the tools to get it up ground

They say they the ones when they make the errors

Can't look in the mirror, that shit wild

Stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage, I'm turnin' it down, can't tan it, can't flower

We do it on the streets, we do it for keeps, we do it for rights

Got fifty-two weeks

This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak

This shit is forever, and it ain't feelin' me

Ridin' and rappin' around

I take me beat and I turn into a beast

Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach

Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed

Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time

They ain't buy the condo, it was part of the lease

And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat

Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat

God done gave me strength
Are these the front row seats you wanted?
We'll have our final moment
A walk-in attraction

A walking distraction

I'm naturally black and

Unnaturally breathing

Like a waist that is snatching

Welcome to my world, where it's packed in

At the top of the tavern

How I see when this happenin'

All the real have been dabbed in

All the, all the bumps and the grabbin'

Ain't no cops here harassing

All the looks and the laughin'

And outside, it got traffic

'Cause inside, we wreak havoc

Yеah, I know when this, yeah, I know when this drastic

Whеre it's goin'

When I back up emotions

All this here, I'm controllin'

When I'm back in the

When I'm back in the streets, on my side, I'm patrollin'

When I'm back in the, when I'm back in the (Ah)



I know our love is forsaken (Woo)

But do you care if I was alive? (Whenever I'm back in the)

Or do you want to be famous? (Woo, yeah)



I took the top off

Like she took her lil' blouse off

Too hard to go drop off

You know that boy not soft

I never would travel

So I need me a time vault

I been up in Cabo

With my Bailey Osanto

In this world, look around, yo

It's just mano y mano

I might still eat McDonald's

But don't think I'm a Ronald

I went back to my land

Move like Moses, walking over seas

In my state because the country

Every part of it is part of me

Tell your parliament, ""Pardon me"" (Woo)

Off the saké, turned to Socrates (Woo)

Heavy moments on the ground

Feel it shapin' in the sound

'Cause we ri—, 'cause we right in yo' house

And you know that we down

If yo' ass don't know nothin'

Gotta know that it's time

I'm excited, it's jumpin'

So much that I'm flyin'

Put you right in the function

Took you right off a vine

Got this shit in a bind

We got it, we got it now

(Agh, woo)

Whenever I'm ducking it

(Agh, woo)



I'm waiting on a let go

I'm waiting on a let go

I know myself, I know exactly how to make you special

Go, go, let your fame

I'm waiting in an echo

I'm waiting in an echo

'Cause you keep calling out, I thought I told you that we do not

Sorry, I didn't let you out, out

Out-out, la-la

I thought it was a setup, watch her, I can't doze off

The dogs out the kennel, watchin' with the scope off

With the heat talk, watch it burn your soul off

I took 'em out of office, now they work for me now

I took her out the background, she play the lead now (Lead)

Put her in the back, made her hold the trees down (Trees)

Tryna tell you what I need, somebody do that there

Late at night, at home, get ratchet, can you do that there?

Bling-bling, I get a rush every time I see some diamonds

She get it up, she gon' bounce it like a trampoline

Keep up with swag, she be fresher than a mannequin

All type of bags in her closet like she married to me, married to me

You a ho so Patek Phillipe

Keep it right there with my postcode (Postcode)

I been jumpin' out the gym with no Jordans on

She been all above the rim or torsos

Princess cuts, diamonds, I got plenty

Lift me up, head high like lean is

Rolls Royce, big ol' truck, I'm in it

Bouncing 'round like he want smoke, I'm a chimney

Tall, her hair long, she Jamaican ('Maican)

And she tryna rage in the bedroom

And she got a Rollie on her leg too (Leg too)

And it's plain gold, Ace of Spade too (Yeah)

Coco Chanel for real on her toes

I got white folk money, Eminem with no gold

I got rose gold teeth and rose gold rims on my Rolls

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

Without goin' deep Shakespeare

Took the squad, brought the play right here

Got the vision and I made that clear

Up from two 'til it's two runnin' plays like the Tennessee kid

I'm the one, that's why they tryna hurt the kid

I'm the one, JH, with the braids with the lights with the ike and the smoke but I can't stay away

See, this life? Man, I can't stay away

Find a vice, man, I can't stay away

Find it hard, why I can't play it safe?

Seen the top ten pen list, I don't even know how they could pin this

Knowin' that I'm the human Pinterest

Need true love but I know true love's like a friendship

But even Titanic had an endin'

I rock the boat with ice so expensive

Hair long, not no extensions

Money long, shit is extended

She need me now, she need me a pendant

I said you need me now, I ain't finished, huh



I said, you need me now

I said, you need me now

You need me (Ah)



I stick to the code, binary like I's and O's (Ooh)

I'm too exposed, I gotta keep curtains closed (Closed)

Her body boat, she hid it behind the clothes (Skeet, skeet, skeet)

I'm in Cabo, I'm hittin' these adios

Just tryna balance all these up and downs but I keep poppin' lows (Lows)

What it is? What it is? That's just how it goes

Pure session, I just kept progressin', and finally found the flows

If the answers down there with the devil, I may never know (Let's go)

My dawg just got freed out the precinct (Free)

Hid it in my bag, let's hit Turks for the weekend (Let's go)

Why did I pop two out that whole pack? Dawg, I'm tweakin' (Geeked)

Baby girl, come suck, keep me up, ain't no sleepin', ooh

Better yet she vegan (Vegan), better yet she tweakin' (Tweakin')

Yeah, 6 A.M., I hit my alarm clock (Yeah)

You see the vision, this shit non-stop, gotta keep my palms hot

Got long roads in my backyard, bitch, I'm a lonestar

The droptop came with the top, I cut the door apart

My brodie keep a stainless to steal, ain't no Chrome Heart (Grr)

I cut some off, I had to better myself

Against the odds, I'd bet on myself

I was at Frank Gibbins before Thanksgiving, thanks to my health

Too many flaws, tryna generate wealth

Man, that's how you go broke and lose bros and lose hope in this shit

I was thinkin' that we both could be rich, I guess it's one-sided

Crazy how they love to talk shit and got no Trident

I'm loyal, bitch, I got Ye over Biden

I let the shit go off the top, yeah, no typin'

How I go from overlooked to these niggas is overbitin'?

How I'm always in they ear? I'm enticin'

Never met her she, but she met Sheck, she don't need a prince

Took her off the O into the D, she ain't take offense

Elevate her up, no need to find me

And dumped them in the creek up from where I live

Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around

We runnin' through the sprinkler looking around

Killer would show up with boxes of pizza

And said he had a label recruitin' people

Put that on my grandma and everythin'

My homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne

It could've been me or could've been you too

What a memory on me, no need to lose

What's gon' scratch up my intertube

So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too

Lit late night on this side

You never come around past midnight

You miss everything on this side

This side, this side, this side

I made a lot of money on this side

Lost a lot of money on this side

Had my first kiss on this side

Learned a lot of shit about this side

Clearly I've been thinking about this side

Tryna get back on this side

Tryna get back what's been mine

I gotta get back on this side

Really miss the feeling of the late nights

Shit we used to do around midnight

Hangin' on the corner, had shit tight

Doin' all the drugs, had to get right

If I could get my partner back it would be nice

He would shoot the one, wouldn't think twice

He was too involved with the street life

Only way to live on this side

This side, this side, this side

This side, this side, this side, this side

This side, this side

This side, this side, this side



Young rich nigga from the north side

Paid my dues on this side

Flipping up bricks on this side

I made it out the hood, I'm on the other side

All my niggas on this side

Keep it one hundred on this side

Love to get money on this side

No new niggas on this side

Look at my diamonds don't get blind

You better handcuff your ho with a zip tie (cuff!)

I will take a busta down on this side

Broke niggas stand to the left side

Handsome and Wealthy on this side

I came from the bottom and now I'm on top, that's phenomenal

This side, this side, this side, this side

If I do not make it I wonder where I will go

This side, this side, this side

Graduated from the midget

This the life I was living

Graduated to a million

It's the money that I'm getting

Graduated from a hotbox now I'm ridin' 'round in a Bentley

How we do it on



This side, this side, this side

Always, always this side

This side, this side, this side

Thats right, thats right

You never come around past midnight

Midnight, midnight

You know how I like my lean, poured right

Just right

On this side

Find everything you need, everything you need on this side

This side, this side, this side

Is right"

Chevelle with a new motor, got the bitch like a sports car

Pray for my liver when I'm off, in this club

I pray that the, demons go away, they hauntin' us

Man I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been livin'

Man I can't take no more of the white powers in position

Gotta grab OJ wheel, gotta scoop up J Rich

Told Chase we ain't goin' back, you know, we gotta hitch

I mean I'm, aggravated, agitated, I admit

Intoxicated, animated, got me feelin' kinda lit

Contemplatin' fornicatin', might as well fuck up some shit

They lookin' at me way too crazy, got me feelin' communist

But I'm just tryin' to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix

If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick

Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz

It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us



Oh, don't pray for love

Oh, say love

Just ask the lonely, oh

Just ask the lonely, oh



Pills

Have you ever been through life's

Challenges? Promises?

Get down here, I'm prayin'



Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques

Let me tell you how I turned Scott

How I went down on the block

Waterfall around ten o'clock

And how we came up gettin' all the knots, dodgin' cops, yeah

'Fore a nigga had the locks

'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops

Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch

Every time we in the party, took it up a notch

Now I'm thinkin' 'bout this new girl, and she doin' pop (Ohhh)

Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box

(Don't pray for love)

Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Ohhh)

And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Said I-)

Mama don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more

I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor

You always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow

And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow

Pray for love



No, oh

We don't pray for love, no more

We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton, no more

We don't wanna see you on the news, no more

All alone



Underrated is an understatement

They tryin' to test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid

These niggas fiends watchin' all of my moves

Cause the music like crack, got me cookin' all day

I'm right here, you know where I stay

And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way

She like my show lights, she want to be wife

She know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life

So I pull out 'fore the climax

Faster than a hi-hat, sorry baby, I don't play

And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'

And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me

My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce

Like they sell that coke boy, shout out to the Coke Boys

They never pray for us, nobody pray for us

Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no



Oh, don't pray for love

Oh, say love (just ask the lonely)

Just ask the lonely, oh (just ask the lonely)"

I can tell baby, I can tell

I can tell



I can tell bout the night tales and the dry spells

All the wrong one and the right things to stay away from

And how we took off and how we on top

And how we won't fall, how we going up

Or how we came up, or how we came up

It all started in the basement

Was an attic but we called that shit the basement

Basis to break all my momma's vases

I shot my first 8 then nigga I probably wasn't eight then

Always hit the gas like I broke wind

They said my way of making dollars never made sense

Come take a dive a waterfall in the deep end

I can tell you bout the nights out in Fort Bend

I can tell baby, I can tell

I can tell baby, I can tell

No you don't tell



Yeah, I can tell bout the night tales

And all the dry wells and the long roads

And all my ideas before the cornrows

How we came up and how we came down

Going donuts, coffee couldn't help now

How we zoned out, made it out the wood now

And what it do when they wanna be your friend now

How to get it, how to live and get it in now

How to great for straight profits making his demands now

I been impulsive, non-emotional, staying humble bout it

Tilt the posture, sick, pass the bottle

Five-o-four hot boys, might have to bad rap like Silkk the Shocker

But I'mma pull up the silk, to shock her with the silk

Nigga you know I been a rocker, dripping milk and knockers

Take it up another notcher, take it up another notcher

I top a, pop a pill, pop a seal to forget about you

I'll bombaclot you, bomba bomba blocka shot you

Bling and bang, a bang a rapper

Bangarang, I brought my money back

Orangutan dollars, ring-a-ling

Bitches hanging on my dang-a-lang



I can tell baby, I can tell

I can tell baby, I can tell

I can tell baby, I can tell

I can tell baby, I can tell

You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales

I bet I take your bitch, she take that dick straight up the stasher

Keep an ounce of garlic just to keep away the Draculas

I came to get it nominated

From a spot that y'all seen Bun B blow up

I hate to break your heart, I bet I'll make the mark

That y'all see a legacy go up

Goyard done break your pockets

Boy I'm out in Paris lettin' all these beats go up

I make in one appearance what these niggas hatin' makin' in four seasons

H-Town, know we gon' stunt

I'm for real and your Rollie tick

Look bitch, this the Rodeo

But I ain't goin' out for your bullshit

I don't want your apple pie, mama

I don't wanna dap up niggas blockin' me

I am everything except a rapper

Shit I got at least 25 lighters on my dresser



Rocks in the night

Rocks in the night

Rocks in the night

Rocks in the night

Rocks in the night

Rocks in the night



Que sera sera, so the story goes

On and on and back and forth, the evolution's absolute

Tours and shows and groupie whores

Wouldn't hesitate if he had to shoot

Though he'd rather not

Forever been the elephant in the room

That everyone can't wait to run and tell about

The head to the body of the belligerent militant group

That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised

Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised

Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind

Will he make it? Was it worth it?

Did he win? Will he survive the Rodeo?"

Pops heatin' up the stove

Close to stealing and killing, just to get 'em on

Til' I took flight and ended up on the shoulder

Now my money a little longer

Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit

Who knew that lump sum will get me on

My fifty seconds last a little longer, longer

I can shit all day, diaper

Call that eating all day, itis

Will I ever fall off? I doubt it



No... noo... nooo...

All these diamonds shinin'

All this gold on me, all these foes on us

How do I dodge these zombies
