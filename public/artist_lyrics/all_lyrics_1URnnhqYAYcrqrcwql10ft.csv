As a mother, every path I walked was for my son
Challenges were a part of the journey
And what I wanted was an afterthought
The idea of providing him proper chances
Helped me to never stop moving forward

Forever confronting whatever transitions that needed to be endured

To make his position as a winner more secured

Now I smile, feeling assured

My choices wеre not in vain

Locations and situations constantly change

But my unwavering hеart remains

For all the trials and all the pain

The mission is as it's always been

For my son to become a man and live free in his American dream"

Once you cross that line, it ain't no tryin' to fix it
You want me to forgive you, let's be realistic
I can't kick it with your kind like I tore my meniscus
How you go from co-defendant to a fuckin' witness?

They'll stand on couches with you, but won't stand on business

Woah

I watched everybody turn on my brother like he ain't have 'em out here flyin' jets and fuckin' bitches

This shit ridiculous

I feel your pain, my brother

I know you from the struggle

I know how hard you hustled just to take care of your mother

I know you took clothes off your back for niggas you call brother

I know how hard it get in this jungle, tryna prevail without bein' tried like you no sucker

Huh, life's a motherfucker, yeah

I know ain't nobody perfect

But what's the point in makin' it out if all they do is cuff ya?



You know, we be comin' from, like, the worst conditions, the worst circumstances

The trenches, the gutter

And sometimes we be forced to make decisions that we don't even wanna make

It be about survival

At the end of the day, we be havin' good hearts

They just be in bad places

I guess that's life, though



Father God, forgive me for my sins

Take the mask off all my enemies that's out here actin' like my friends

Did some shit I'm prayin' I never gotta do again

I put blood, sweat, and tears inside this win

If I take care of my hood, the prosecutor call me Gotti

Turn my back on the hood, they probably kill me, probably rob me

It's a Catch-22, I'm bein' honest

Hard work, tryna keep the past behind me

I still be havin' flashbacks 'bout Johnny

Fast forward and the major label signed me

Had to hustle, had to focus, perseverance

Mama used to go to TJ Maxx and shop on clearance

Tayman and CJ, I can still feel they spirits

Skinny and Wanwan used to rap, I know they hear it

It ain't that easy, puttin' pain inside of lyrics

Send this up to Heaven so they can clear it



Y'all know, like, real street niggas gon' feel this shit

And I don't want niggas to get misunderstood

'Cause the rules we live by, don't even matter no more

Just a, just a setback for you to come back

Can't hold a nigga down forever

'Cause a lotta broke niggas 'round the way ridin' 'round town

And they lookin' for my face

Gotta pray to God above you, girl, you know that Savage love you

And I hope that you feel the same

Tryna be the one for you, but my nickname true

And I hope that I can change

Girl, you know that Savage love you, girl, you know that Savage love you



Gotta turn my bitch up, turn my bitch up

Turn my bitch up, turn my bitch up

Turn my bitch up, turn my bitch up

Turn my bitch up, turn my—

Know I gotta turn my bitch up, turn my bih, T-T

Turn my bih, T-T, turn my bih

Gotta turn my bitch up, turn my— (Ayy)



I gotta stop goin' Van Cleef, condo, third week

I like it, but I'm too geeked, tryna turn you up

I gotta stop goin' Lenci', Rollie, first week

You're misreadin' me, I'm too geeked, tryna turn you up

You were lost until me

I didn't get no finder's fee

You're actin' like a bride-to-be

Behind closed doors, slimin' me

Friends are all advisin' me

Sayin' I could die tryna turn you up

There's three sides to this story, girl

The one you subtweet

The one your group chat gets to read

The one you come and tell to me

I understand it finally

I'm tryin' to give you highs and you're plannin' our goodbyes

But I turn you up

It's my fault

Burnin' cash like it's lit on fire

Penthouse and some new attire

I fulfilled all of your desires

You don't work, but you act retired

'Cause you know that you're mine and it's my fault

It's my fault, it's my fault, for once I take accountability

It's my fault that you got superpowers on your knees

It's my fault for once, don't keep you grounded on your feet

It's my fault for once, I drain accounts to make you love me

It's my fault for once, it's one-sided loyalty

My fault for once, I'm payin' lawyer fees

Doin' things just to set you free, see you breathe

It's my fault for once, I got the Wagon, G

Got you ridin' 'round with niggas that are nothin' like me

It's my fault for once, that's how you make it seem

It's my fault, it's my fault



You were lost until me

You were lost until me, mm-mm, mhm-mm

You were lost until me



My confidence is super low

Baby M, you know I got a heart of gold

You pawned that shit and hit the road, baby

For goodness sakes, at this rate

Your funeral is finna have like ten caskets on display

One for you, the other nine for everything you're takin' to the grave

You don't play, you don't, you don't, you

You don't play no games

There's three things I learned from love for free

Only thing really worth chasing is a dream

People don't know you play your roles on screen

Messy, started gettin' trendy, gotta keep it clean

You know I keep it clean

Clean as I can

All weapons formed against me gotta jam

Brought you 'round the dawgs, treat you like the fam'

Shoulda been a wham, bam, thank you ma'am

Know you got my confidence on sale

Case you wanna feel better 'bout yourself



You were lost until me

You were lost until me"

Look

Long way from sentimental

Meet Thomazzo and Ernesto

Short rigatoni with the pesto

These verses are my manifesto

Hallways got an echo

Me and Smigs on the loose in the city, you know how the rest go

Casual sex, I'm like, ""Fuck a dress code""

The first martini is an espresso

Chill shot glasses with prosecco

Niggas so ignorant in our hood, they be like, ""Why thе fuck you makin' techno?""

I'm worldwide and this is just another cargo jеt flow, I had to let go

Life insurance policies, you niggas 'bout to need the gecko

I got some meaner threats, though

Me, Spider-Man, and Leonardo, I'm back tomorrow

I had the chopper to a wedding out in Monaco or Monte Carlo

I'm losin' track of where we all go

I wouldn't trade my life for none of y'alls, it's an embargo

Fifty-nine bags on the 767, this is heavy cargo

Yeah

Fifty-nine bags on the—, ayy

Swedish jail cell smellin' like some Carby Musk

For your birthday, your boyfriend got a party bus

Bottle signs, club lines, should've come with us

We left that shit in '09 when we was comin' up

I mean, these just my suggestions of course

I'm ridin' here fresh off divorce

And I'm tryna look in her eyes, maybe express my remorse

If she want a rebound with me, I'm down to go get her some boards

I'm here for the moral support

Whippin' the Vespa off of six tequilas

Big Benjamins like the Pittsburgh Steelers

Drake, you got it

Robert Kraft sent the jet for us, that shit was patriotic

You would think we live in Baltimore, the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product

Teachin' niggas how to mind they business, and my latest stuff

Might be the only teacher that gets paid enough

That's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods

You niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris

If we don't like you, you payin' tax and tariffs

Come to the 6 and I'm like the actin' sheriff, deputy

First got to America, niggas wouldn't check for me

No chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy

They underestimated my trajectory

But now they gotta pay that shit direct to me

I send the label bills, bills, bills like the other two women standing next to Bey, that shit was just—

Independent women is lovin' the new appearance

Matter of time before I go net a Bey like a Paris

Like, ""Honey, you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus""

I got my head in the clouds, I'm serious

The lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods

Promise you'll get that shit when the sky clears

This shit designed for divine ears

My favorite two words from you white boys is, ""Sign here""

And then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers

Swear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years

And then we 'bout to kick this shit in high gear

Eight karats like vegetarians, nigga, the earrings are droopy

Contract Lord of the Rings, think it's a script for the movie

Shout out TVGUCCI, my cousin is spooky

I swear you don't even mean what y'all say like y'all dubbin' a movie

Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie

He claim we don't got a problem but

No, boo, it is like you comin' for sushi

We might pop up on 'em at will like Suzuki

Kawasaki, sushi, saké, the money grow on trees like shiitake

They tried to get spicy with me, so I wonder how they gon' stop me

I'm really on a roll like hamachi

The fuck would y'all really do without me?

For your birthday, your man got a table at Hibachi

Last time I ate there, Wayne was doin' numbers off the cup like Yahtzee

And Paris Hilton was steady duckin' the paparazzi

Quavo might've sent me a song that he called ""Versace""

I really can't remember it properly

All I know is that God got me, I'm sittin' on large properties

Treat me like a newborn, Lucian not droppin' me

I'm goin' Pink Floyd, you niggas cannot rock with me

She could be givin' me head and somehow you not toppin' me

Niggas see the 6ix God pass, they high-fivin' me

Need to be high-sixin' me

Swear niggas highkey sick of me

They wifey on my head 'cause I vibe differently

Feel like an AMBER Alert the way that I can take her to the mall and she find Tiffany

I'm like a cup holder the way that these dimes stick to me

They should've been in the fountain based on what y'all wishin' me



Know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah

Million-dollar spot (Brr, brr)

That's how motherfuckers in CMB play it

Middle of the ocean (Blatt)

Just like that (Shine, shine)

All dark fresh green water

Land that thing

With 'bout a hundred hoes

We up and we livin' like that, boy

Fresh fly fish like, you understand me, like, real G shit

You hear me? A neighborhood superstar

It's bigger than anything

You know, we start from the bottom, then we come to the top

Get to the top and we stay up there

You hear me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)

We look down and we'll be down, but we stayin' up

And we rise up, we stay on 'em, you heard me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)

Big Florida water, big water ocean

On that type of time

You understand me?

Rich nigga, rich life, you understand me?

Come from the bottom, but we come from the bottom (Rich life)

But we understand the bottom 'cause we come from it

And we live with it (You understand?)

Go to our grave 'bout this here, boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)"

So now what's the problem?
Don't go hiding again
Tired of asking where you been
You left so abruptly

I guess it's fuck me

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Before it's over

I need you to come over once again

And before you give me closure

Need you to come a little bit closer



Still steppin' like Omega Psi Phi for mine

If bein' real was a crime, I'd be doin' life

Like that nigga not nicе, I don't know polite

I'm the first evеr antisocial socialite

The pain that I seen in my mother's eyes in 2009

Have me workin' 'til it's 2049

And get hate when I tell you, ""Oh, some other time""

Like I really got some other time

You just tell me, ""Never mind""

Know I sound crazy to a lazy mind

Know it'll be a different kind

Shout out to the people workin' nine to five

I be workin' nine to nine

And the six upside down, it's a nine

You already know the vibe

And they leave 'cause of pride, but they comin' back every time

The devils that I recognize, most of them got pretty eyes

Titties and some plans of just gettin' by, that's the way they live or die

Easy to judge, but, girl, who am I?

Truth or dare, I'ma take a double dare

Truth is a suicide

I would rather live a lie, keep you on the outside

Introduce you to the guys

Have you throwin' up the south side like you're one of mine

But you're not one of mine

You belong to everybody else when you're bored in your free time

Shit could make a thug cry, play it like a tough guy

Couldn't even land in the Hamptons, they didn't have the stairs for the shit I fly

Swear it's like a metaphor, I can't even get down from the shit I climb

Can't even get down from the shit I climb

Yeah, girl, you're my size

Make me tell you one time

We was on the front line, shit was in my bloodline

Waitin' for the sunshine

But the sun never shines on me, on me

Sleepin' in the whip sometimes, girl, I was sleepin' upright

Henny, red cup life, broski kept it tucked tight

Niggas talkin' bad shit about what they gon' do to mine

Aw, now their tongues tied

We was smokin', watched the sun climb

I would trap until my thumbs cried

Tryna change it all in one line

Never seen a thug cry

Love, it's been a long time

Bet you never seen a thug cry

Hit me on my hotline

And no, ma, I'm not fine at all



Don't go hiding again

Tired of asking where you been

You left so abruptly

I guess it's fuck me

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Before it's over

I need you to come over once again

And before you give me closure

Need you to come a little bit closer"

And left unchecked can end up being what subtracts him from life

If possible, all enemies should be eliminated"

Got a Glock on my hip, niggas hippity-hop

He was dissin' on songs and that shit got him shot

Hit his block with a broom, hit his block with a mop

We ain't talking to bitches, we ain't talking to cops (Fuck 12)

Check the forecast, I got galore cash

Had them killers on your step like DoorDash

Fuck your baby daddy with his dork ass

We at the bottom, nigga, show me your extort pass

All the opps fans, they be imitating

Blowing gunsmoke, that's how we demonstrating

Hit his baby mama while he had the baby

Gave me good jaw, I gave her penetration

You know we want all the smoke, nigga, Lucy

I'll never fall off, I might take a break

You know either way it go, my family gon' be straight

Still in debt from all the losses that I had to take

When you out here tryna evolve, they gon' call you fake

I can't turn my back on the gang no matter what I make

I done took a lot of risks to make sure niggas ate

Superhero in my hood, I don't need a cape

When all is said and done

We can only judge, punish, reward, enslave, and free ourselves

There will always be doubters and haters, but they only have the power you give them

Remain focused, move forward, and never lose faith in yourself

Until next time, stay in Savage Mode

Because anything else would be too damn civilized

When these men join forces to put the focus of reaching the same goals, to attain the same outcomes, they are not two, but one
Instead of simply adding one's common attributes to another's, they somehow tend to multiply all attributes of both

Rockin' Christian Dior, nigga, I'm in rare form

Savage ball like '97, '98 Jordan

Step back, shoot you in your face like I'm James Harden



When it's all said and done, who you gon' ride for?

Who you gon' slide for? Who you down to die for?

I gave her my heart, she was tellin' lies, though

Sleepin' with my guys, though, that shit turned my heart cold

I came from the bottom, I didn't have a dime, bro

Apartments with the blinds, bro, still got on my grind, though

I know my mama proud, everybody fine, bro

This shit took some time, bro, finally get my shine on



Right hand on my Glock, left hand on her coochie

Cock the chop, hit your top, nigga, Bruce Lee

I'm the boogeyman, pussies can't spook me

Got your BM on my line talkin' 'bout, ""Scoop me""

You know I got a soft spot for the hoochies

I don't talk to bitches, bitches talk the bullshit

I bought every pair of Amiris in the boutique

You know we want all the smoke, nigga, Lucy

I'll never fall off, I might take a break

You know either way it go, my family gon' be straight

Still in debt from all the losses that I had to take

When you out here tryna evolve, they gon' call you fake

I can't turn my back on the gang no matter what I make

I done took a lot of risks to make sure niggas ate

Superhero in my hood, I don't need a cape

I be lost sometimes, feelin' like I'm runnin' in place



When it's all said and done, who you gon' ride for?

Who you gon' slide for? Who you down to die for?

I gave her my heart, she was tellin' lies, though

Sleepin' with my guys, though, that shit turned my heart cold

I came from the bottom, I didn't have a dime, bro

I know my mama proud, everybody fine, bro

This shit took some time, bro, finally get my shine on



(Metro)

When all is said and done

We can only judge, punish, reward, enslave, and free ourselves

There will always be doubters and haters, but they only have the power you give them

Remain focused, move forward, and never lose faith in yourself

Until next time, stay in Savage Mode

Because anything else would be too damn civilized

Peace"

They can be years or even generations apart in age
And yet, somehow, find themselves on the exact same page
When these men join forces to put the focus of reaching the same goals, to attain the same outcomes, they are not two, but one
Instead of simply adding one's common attributes to another's, they somehow tend to multiply all attributes of both
Whether from St. Louis or East Atlanta

Whether from a savage land or a booming metropolis

Whether they are two or two billion, the greatest their numbers could ever become, is to truly become one

You know I ain't that nigga to be played, do your homework

If I could do it all over, I'd make the same mistakes

All that fucking over made me who I am today

Slime Maybach with the drapes, you can't see me crash

Turn a bitch into a nigga, nigga turned into a ho (21)

Poppin' molly nigga, San-Tan

Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash

Another toe-tagged nigga laying in the grass



Five shooters in the back of the Uber nigga and they ready to shoot

I tie my laces, I dip in that bag nigga and I take me a boof

I'm the Slaughter King nigga, I don't give a fuck about you

You get you some money, you get you some fame, these bitches gon' come out the blue

Bullet holes in my body, paranoid I'ma pop it

If you snitchin' I'ma pop it, wrong move, I'ma drop it

.15 in my sock, trappin' at the bus stop

Came from a nigga rock, now I got a whole block

She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle
Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning baby no NyQuil
And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it
All my garments come from France, French kissing in France

Hundred thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants

And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it



I can't stop it, hundred thousand stuffed in my pocket

Pull up on a nigga with a rocket, if I pull it out then imma pop it

I call her bike life cuz she riding, non-stop it, eat the pussy up and then a nigga get it popping

Finger licking good like shrimp and teriyaki

VVS diamonds got my watch playing hockey

21 savage I get money like a Jew, hundreds on me blue, hundreds on me blue

You know I'm a slut, I'll fuck your crew

Yeah I'm a dog like that, pull up in a rarri with the top dropped back

Pull up on your block with the chop cocked back

Pew pew pew, make a nigga walk back

1017 they need to bring the wop back, when I get inside that pussy baby I can't stop

I love it when I see them nipples through the crop top

Butt crack showing in them G-Star jeans

Make a nigga wanna go and buy her a ring

She gon' turn a nigga to a fiend, she gon' make a nigga kill the scene

She gon' hold my dope when I'm in need, she gon' bail me out when I'm in need



She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle

Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning baby no NyQuil

And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it

All my garments come from France, French kissing in France

Hundred thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants

And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it



Put the money in the safe, you could beat it like a case

I've been waiting all day, so I could put it in your face

Been real with him from the start know a lot of niggas sell out

Get up in the jam you know who to call to bail out

Got a bad bitch, know these niggas gon' hate

Can't stop getting money bitch I don't got brakes

If a nigga bout his bread, it be getting to his head

He be running from the feds, left a lot of niggas dead

Ain't enough kush, he be rolling like dice

Show him who the business now he wanna throw the rights

He'll pay for it if I gave him a price, fuck around with my type boy you know you ain't right

I'm knowing your bitch ain't had shit

Its Dreezy and 21 Savage

Yeah million dollar nigga blow the money like a whistle

Take me where I wanna order steak up off the menu

Hard head nigga, know he gripping on a pistol, if you buy me a ring we can make this shit official

Fucking with me harder than your niggas, power couple yeah we all up on a mission

I know when you gotta handle business, you know imma be here waiting for you when you finish

Let's get it



She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle

Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning baby no NyQuil

And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it

All my garments come from France, French kissing in France

Hundred thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants

And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it"

I got fifty bags of gas, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?
Help me, can you help me?
I pulled up in a Fisker then I pulled off in a Tesla
Thought this shit was sweet, I left his ass on a stretcher

I don't catch feelings, I'm too busy catching death tolls



Pull up in the trenches, pull up in the trenches!

I said that shit on woe, dog

I got the juice like O-Dog

I got 'caine like I'm Kane

Me and Lotto in that fucking Fisker switching lanes

Pull up on a pussy nigga and fuck on his main

I just spent a fifty-thousand dollars on a chain

I just spent a twenty on a motherfucking ring

Young Savage bitch, I got this shit off cocaine

Skrt, skrt, skrt

Pull up on your bitch and give her that skrr

Pull up on your bitch and drop that work

Yeah, and I'm still getting paid

Bitches getting slaughtered, man these bitches getting slayed

Keep that Glock 40, dare a nigga to touch my chain

I shoot this motherfucker like my name Max Payne



Help me, can you help me?

I got fifty bags of gas, can you help me?

I just cooked another brick, can you help me?

Help me, can you help me?

I pulled up in a Fisker then I pulled off in a Tesla

Thought this shit was sweet, I left his ass on a stretcher

I don't catch feelings, I'm too busy catching death tolls



I'm a dog like Michael Vick

I used to sell them Michael Vicks

I can't even lie, I ain't never sold a brick

But I got some partners who done really sold them bricks

Young Savage bitch and I done really hit them licks

I really put that pistol on these pussy nigga's shit

Run up on a nigga, better take a nigga shit

If your diamond's hitting you could take a nigga bitch

I hit four hundred and went a bought a 'vette

Your diamonds so cloudy, who the fuck sold you that shit?

You know damn well don't no Rolex fucking tick

Get your motherfucking money up nigga, try again nigga, 21

Oil based dope, I gotta try again

Dope got wet, it gotta dry again

Pussy ass rappers telling lies again

Pussy ass, bitch ass fuck boy



Help me, can you help me?

I got fifty bags of gas, can you help me?

I just cooked another brick, can you help me?

Help me, can you help me?

I pulled up in a Fisker then I pulled off in a Tesla
