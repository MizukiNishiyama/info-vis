Smile, you recordin'?
Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal and... yeah

Kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then

Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now

Tryna put a million on the whole team now

Push through the pain so we can see new life

So all the ladies havin' babies, see a sacrifice

Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian

Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian

Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate

Society shame and the pain was too much to take

Cried tears of joy when you fell in love

Don't matter to me if it's a him or her

I just wanna see you smile through all the hate

Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake



Bad times turn to good memories, smile

Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile

Good times never fade away, smile

Even if I'm not with you here today, smile

Good morn' or evening, friends

Smile

Here's your friendly announcer

Smile



Far as draft picks, my name did not get called

Bet before I go I put a billion on the board

Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen

Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?

Flyin' paper planes through the projects

Now the whole projects on my jet

Now you see the real in the front row

In every one of y'all televised shows

Super facts

Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that

A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson

Appreciate the pain, it's a blessin'



Bad times turn to good memories, smile

Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile

Good times never fade away, smile

Even if I'm not with you here today, smile

Good morn' or evening, friends



I mastered my aesthetics

I know you often heard me wax poetic

'Bout bein' back in the Lexus

But trust me, that was nothin'

A nigga up in the hundreds of millions

I have no ceilings, ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy

Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy""

Slappin' out of the toy, the separation is clear

In my rear-view mirror, objects is further than they appear

Oh yeah, I was born with a pair

Playin' for high stakes

Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear

How niggas can't relate?

Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake

In charge of my own fate

Respect Jimmy Iovine

But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime

And niggas playin' for power, huh

So our music is ours

Niggas only own houses

Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""

Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you

Put the rest away for Blue""

That blood money, I giggle at it

Can't even support my miss's habit

Jewelry shoppin' in Paris

All y'all jewelers should be embarrassed, huh

Blood diamonds drippin' with guilt

I still ain't trippin', that's life, winners and losers

Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless

My therapist said I relapsed

I said, ""Prehaps I Freudian slipped in European whips""

God sent me to break the chain

I'm the true and livin'

God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain

A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ

Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you

Ahhhh, what did I do?

'Cept try to free you

Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you

Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh

Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to

This was meant to be a haiku, huh

But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two

Oh, these that drugs

Heroin flow, I spaz on the stove

This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?

Look, you a pedestrian

Don't ever question the security I provided you

Oh y'all thought I was washed?

I'm at the cleaners

Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh

Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church

When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt

Fear for you, bro, we know the system don't work

Take a young nigga's freedom over some dirt

Yet it's legal in Colorado

Yeah, we deny

Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise

That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap

That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that

All these people was gon' kill me, heh

'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me

Welcome back Carter, smile



Living in the shadow

Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?

In the shadows people see you as happy and free

Because that's what you want them to see

Living two lives, happy, but not free

You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love

The world is changing and they say it's time to be free

But you live with the fear of just being me

Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be

No harm for them, no harm for me

But life is short, and it's time to be free

Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

Super Bowl goals

My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold

We in a whole different mode

Kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed

I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed

Oh, we gon' reach a billi' first

I told my wife the spiritual shit really work

Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all

Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt

All this old talk left me confused

You'd rather be old rich me or new you?

And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new

Like, 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh



Nobody wins when the family feuds

But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit

I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?

Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute

Mmmmm

Pretty much

If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us

Fuck rap, crack cocaine

Nah we did that, Black-owned things

Hundred percent, Black-owned champagne

And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams

Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, huh

But we ain't get through to you yet, uh

What's better than one billionaire? Two (two)

'Specially if they're from the same hue as you

Y'all stop me when I stop tellin' the truth



Hahahaha

I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin', but that ain't even a statement

That's like sayin' I'm the tallest midget

Wait, that ain't politically correct

Forget it

Can I get ""Amen"" from the congregation?

Amen, amen

Can I get a ""Amen"" from the congregation?

Amen, amen



Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me

Let me alone, Becky

A man that don't take care his family can't be rich

I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit

My consciousness was Michael's common sense

I missed the karma and that came as a consequence

Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'

Can't losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain

Nobody wins when the family feuds

We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools

I'm tryna fix you

I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official

Y'all think small, I think Biggie

Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi

Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies

How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?

Old niggas never accepted me

New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis

We all lose when the family feuds

What's better than one billionaire? Two

I'll be damned if I drink some Belvedere while Puff got CÎROC

Y'all need to stop

Cooking coke in the kitchen back when Rodman was a Piston
Mike was losing to Isiah but he soon would get his sixth one

Gave birth to my verbal imagination assume a virtue if you have not

Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet

""Lord, we know who we are

Yeah, we know not what we may be""

So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy

I'm from Marcy houses where the boys die by the thousand

Back when Pam was on Martin yeah that's where it all started

When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'll pack a nine millimeter when Slick Rick made Mona Lisa

When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas ya'll

Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah

Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts

There's room on the bandwagon, don't abort

Marcy me



Marcy me

Streets is my artery, the vein of my existence

I'm the Gotham City heartbeat

I started in lobbies now, probably with Saudis

Sufi to the goofies I could probably speak Farsi

That's poetry read a coca leaf from my past

Came through the bushes smelling like roses I need a trophy just for that

Old Brooklyn not this new shit, shift feel like a spoof

Fat laces in your shoe I'm talking busting off the roof

Hold a uzi vertical, let the thing smoke

Y'all flirting with death I be winking through the scope

Shout out to all the murderers turned murals, plural fuck the Federal Bureau

Shout out to Nostrand Ave. Flushing Ave. Myrtle

All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile

Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes

Thus concluding my concerto, Marcy me



Must be in the air, oh can't walk away I know I know

Just the way I was raised I know I know I know

Oh Marcy, Marcy me just the way I am always gonna be

I ain't gonna change, no

Marcy, Marcy me just the way I am

Leave a peace for your siblings to give to their children too

Tidal the champagne D'usse I'd like to see

A nice peace-fund ideas from people who look like we

We gon' start a society within a society

That's major, just like the Negro League

There was a time America wouldn't let us ball

Those times are now back, just now called Afro-tech

Generational wealth, that's the key

My parents ain't have shit, so that ship started with me

That was the sweetest thing of all time, uh

""Your seed, married his seed, married my seed""

That's how we keep Carter money all in the family

You see, my father, son of a preacher man

Who's daughter couldn't escape the reach of the preacher's hand

That charge of energy set all the Carters back

It took all these years to get to zero in fact

I hated religion 'cause here was this Christian

He was preaching Sundays, versus how he was living Monday

Someday I forgive him 'cause strangely our division led to multiple religions I studied

Muslim, Buddhist, and Christians, and

I was running from him, He was giving me wisdom

See how the universe works?

It takes my hurt and help me find more of myself

It's a gift and a curse

That's called the red queens race



You run this hard just to stay in place

Keep up the pace, baby

Keep up the pace

You run this hard just to stay in place

30 mill for one fight

But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight

Take the good with the bad

No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute

Let's make love on a million, in a dirty hotel

With the fan on the ceiling, all for the love of drug dealing

Marble Floors, gold Ceilings

Oh what a feeling - fuck it I want a billion

Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up

Condos in my condos, I wanna row of

Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma

Even my old fans like old man just stop

I could if I would but I can't

I'm hot, and you blow

I'm still the man to watch, Hublot

On my left hand or not

Soon I step out the booth

The cameras pops niggas is cool with it

Till the canons pop

Now my hand on the bible

On the stand got your man in a jam, again

Got my hands in cuffs

I'm like god damn enough

I put down the cans and they ran amok

My hairpin

Piece skin rupture spleens

Cracks rips go through cribs and other things

No sympathy for the king huh

Niggas even talk about your baby crazy

Eventually the pendulum swings

Don't forget America this how you made me

Come through with 'Ye mask on

Spray everything like SAMO

Though I won't scratch the Lambo

They can't keep a gooda man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse

Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse

Here comes the officers askin' for a search

They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs



[Verse 1: Jay-Z]

You in the presence of a king

Scratch that, you in the presence of a God

Put in the belly of the beast

I escaped, a nigga never had a job

Scott Boras, you over baby

Robinson Cano, you coming with me

These niggas is like rotary phones

It's a new day, hit up KD

Niggas always try to knock a nigga down

Knock me to my knees about a million times

Uncle said I'll never sell a million records

I sold a million records like a million times

These niggas shouldn't let me in

I ball so hard on ESPN

See my name come across on CNN

'Bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again

'Bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again



[Hook 2x: Travi$ Scott]

Shit on me

These niggas tried to shit on me

I was left for dead

They tried to wipe me out of your history



[Verse 2: Jay-Z]

Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope

Bulletproof love, Niggas down since the yolk

Bitch asked if I was God

Fuck I'm supposed to say, ""no""

You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T.

You already know what I could do with the coke

Drop it in the water, made it disappear

I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope

I make my roof get ghost

Bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold

All the shit did, I wasn't supposed to live

Hallelujah Hov

Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able

Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead

Best friends become ya enemies

Niggas' knives are double-edged

Have you bow down to your highness? And do you know how heaven taste?

Arm, leg, leg, arm, head - this is God body

Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding - we just want our equality

Food, clothing, shelter - help a nigga find some peace

Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in the streets

Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati

They can't believe this much skill is in the human body

He's 6'2, how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?

Aw fuck it you got me

Question religion, question it all

Question existence until them questions are solved

Meanwhile this heretic I be out in Marrakesh

Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship

Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo Yellow shit

Color of Jello-O shit

Hello bitch, it's me again

Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and

That's me in the corner

That's me in the spotlight

Losing my religion

Getting ghost in the Ghost

Can you see me?

Can you see me?

Have mercy on a Judas, angels wings on a 'ghini

I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down

Y'all religion creates division

Like my Maybach partition n

God is my chauffeur



Boy they loves Hova

From the south side of Chi

To Brooklyn where I growed up I confess

God in the flesh

Live among the serpents

Turn arenas into churches

I'm like Michael recycle, these are not 16s

These are verses from bible

Tell the preacher he's a preacher

I'm a motherfucking prophet, smoke a tree of knowledge

Drink from a gold chalice, you gotta love it

I arrive at pearly gates, I had luggage

Meaning I had baggage

Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters

Only God could judge us, motherfuckers

Blood stains the Colosseum doors

Lies on the lips of a priest

Thanksgiving disguised as a feast

Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche

Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police

Cocaine seats

All white like I got the whole thing bleached

Drug dealer chic

I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach

Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?

Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?

Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra

I call that jungle fever

You will not control the threesome

Just roll the weed up until I get me some

We formed a new religion

No sins as long as there's permission

And deception is the only felony

So never fuck nobody without telling me

Sunglasses and Advil

Last night was mad real

Sun coming up, 5 a.m

I wonder if they got cabs still

Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard

Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard

Two tattoos: one read ""No Apologies""

The other said ""Love is Cursed by Monogamy""

It's something that the pastor don't preach

It's something that a teacher can't teach

When we die, the money we can't keep

But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap

Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears

Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs

Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move

My nephew gone, My heart is torn

Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born

My faith in God, Every day is hard

Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard

Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all

So que sera, Get a case of Syrah

Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far

My dreams is big, Reality set in

Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,

Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas

Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it

Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5

I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin

I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending

Where the fuck is the sun?

It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son

What happened to my smile?

My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket

I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it

Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low

God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?

I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment

I look in the mirror, My only opponent

Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?

Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
The paper read murder, Black on black murder
The paper read murder, Black on black murder



[Jay-Z:]

This is to the memory of Danroy Henry

Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly

Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team

Giving you respect, I expect the same thing

All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code

I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load

Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be

Power to the people, When you see me, see you



[Kanye West:]

And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital

Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon

Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,

No shop class but half the school got a tool,

And I could die any day type attitude

Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue

It's time for us to stop and re-define black power

41 souls murdered in 50 hours



The paper read murder, Black on black murder,

The paper read murder, Black on black murder again

Murder again...



Is it genocide?

Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized

Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size

The old pastor closed the cold casket

And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs

It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from

I feel the pain in my city wherever I go

314 soldiers died in Iraq

509 died in Chicago



[Jay-Z:]

I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died

Real niggas just multiply

And they say 21 I was supposed to die

So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise

If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival

You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you

What up blood? What up cause?

It's all black, I love us



[Kanye West:]

The paper read murder, Black on black murder again



[Jay-Z:]

It's a celebration of black excellence

Black tie, black Maybachs

Black excellence, opulence, decadence

Tuxes next to the president, I'm present

I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris

In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb

Do you know who I am Clarice?

No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""

Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success

The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast

I repeat, My religion is the beat

My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino

Only spot a few blacks the higher I go

What's up to Will, Shoutout to O

That ain't enough, We gon need a million more

Kick in the door, Biggie flow

I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go



[Kanye West:]

Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go

So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P

From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys

We like the promised land of the OG's

In the past if you picture events like a black tie

What the last thing you expect to see, black guys

What's the life expectancy for black guys?

The system's working effectively, that's why

I'll be a real man and take care of your son

Every problem you had before this day is now done

New crib, watch a movie

Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues

Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci

Now ain't nothin new but your shoes

Sunday morning, Praise the Lord

You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for

So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor

Black excellence, Truly yours"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]

I told my mama I was on the come up

She said ""you going to school I'll give you a summer""

Then she met NO ID and gave me his number

10 years later she driving a Hummer

Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye

What I do? Turn around gave them beats to Jay

And I'm rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy

I guess I'm getting high off my own supply

Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic

Started a little blog just to get some traffic

Old folks'll tell you not to play in traffic

A million hits and the web crashes - damn!

South Park had them all laughing

Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin'

Ignore the critics just to say we did it

This ain't no fashion show, motherfucker, we live it



[Hook]



[Verse 2: Jay-Z]

I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma

For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana

Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer

Straight out the kitchen, shh don't wake Nana!

Built a republic, that still stands

I'm trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man's

Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this water

The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order

Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up YaYa?

What's that smell? Oh I'm just boiling some aqua

No papa, bad Santa

The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners

I got my liberty, chopping grams up

Street justice, I pray God understand us

I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers

This is the Star Spangled Banner

Oooooh
I love you so
But why I love you

I'll never know [x4]



[Jay-Z:]

Picture if you will, that the throne was burning

Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning

Why does it always end up like this?

Something that we don't determine

Same people that I fought for

That I fight for, that I ride for

That I live for, that I die for

Be the reason that these niggas is alive for

And they want me dead

But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you

But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you

We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th

Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?

When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over

I tried to teach niggas how to be kings

And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers

So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn

So we no longer wear the same uniform

Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller

The castle got bigger, The walls got taller

And truth be told after all that said

Niggas still got love for you



[Chorus: Mr Hudson]

I love you so

But why I love you

I'll never know [x4]



[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]

Showed love to you niggas

You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it

I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it

God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it

Shit feelin' like death don't it

Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it

I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it

Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it

But first I shall digress on it

Wasn't I a good king?

(Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)

Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?

(Huh, I gave you my loyalty)

Made you Royalty and royalties

(Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)

And this is how niggas rewardin me

(Damn)



[Chorus: Mr Hudson]

I love you so

But why I love you

I'll never know [x4]



[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]

Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me

But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me

Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)

And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?

(Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)

Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist

So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit

Am I my brother's keeper?

(Only if that nigga don't creep up)

Got a pistol under my pillow

(I've never been a deep sleeper)

P-p-p-paranoia

(Cause the nigga that said he'll...)

Blast for ya (Is now...)

Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya

(These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)

Please lord (Forgive him)

For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)"

[Chorus:]
A little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness

Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses

Such would astound you

The joy of children laughing around you

These are the makings of you

It is true, the makings of you, oh



[Kanye West:]

I do it for the fore-fathers and the street authors

That are not A&R's in the cheap office

Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers

Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us

Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake

She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake

Now there's crumbs all over the damn place

And she want me to cum all over her damn face

I never understood planned parenthood

Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood

Taking refills of that plan B pill

Another shorty that won't make it to the family will

If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will

They ain't crazy they don't know how insanity feel

Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad

But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had



[Chorus]



[Kanye West:]

No Electro, no metro, a little retro, I perfecto

You know the demo, ya boy act wild

You ain't get the memo, Yeezy's back in style

Now when Rome go Gidget the other got Bridget

What's more tripped out though is they sisters

Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they sisters

They momma, named them after white bitches

So next time you see me on your fallopian

Though the Jewelry's Egytian, know the hunger's Ethiopian

Stupid questions like ""Is he gon be dope again?

Have You seen him? has anybody spoke to him? ""

This beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch and a bag of weed the Holy Trinity

In the mirror where I see my only enemy,

Your life's cursed, well mine's an obscenity



[Chorus]



[Jay-Z:]

This is my momma shit

I used to hear this through the walls in the hood when I was back in my pyjama shit

Afro's and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja hat will be popping like the sample that I'm rhyming with

Pete Rock, let the needle drop

I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don't needle pop

Taking sips of pop, six packs of millanips

Pink champel, Valentine L

Bally's on my feet help me balance out well

That and the shit I used to balance on the scale

I got it honest from the parties from my momma's

Virgin Mary's try to judge her, I'm like ""where the Madonna's now? ""

Give all glory to Gloria, they said ""you raised that boy too fast, but you was raising a warrior""

We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us



[Kid Cudi:]

Keep you hands up, get mine up

Don't let them take your fire

Keep you hands up, get mine up

Don't let them take your fire

Keep you hands up, get mine up

Don't let them take your fire

Keep you hands up, get mine up

Yeaaaah, okay

Tears on the mausoleum floor

Blood stains the Colosseum doors

Lies on the lips of a priest

Thanksgiving disguised as a feast

Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche

Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police

Cocaine seats

All white like I got the whole thing bleached

Drug dealer chic

I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach

Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?

Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?

All for Plato, screech

I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks

Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats

I live by you, desire

I stand by you, walk through the fire

Your love is my scripture

Let me into your encryption



Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra

I call that jungle fever

You will not control the threesome

Just roll the weed up until I get me some

We formed a new religion

No sins as long as there's permission

And deception is the only felony

So never fuck nobody without telling me

Sunglasses and Advil

Last night was mad real

Sun coming up, 5 a.m

I wonder if they got cabs still

Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard

Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard

Two tattoos: one read ""No Apologies""

The other said ""Love is Cursed by Monogamy""

It's something that the pastor don't preach

It's something that a teacher can't teach

When we die, the money we can't keep

But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap

Preach

What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?

Told me ""keep my own money"" if we ever did split up

How can somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures?

With jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers

Uh, Picasso was alive he woulda made her

Thats right nigga Mona Lisa can't fade her

I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice

But why all the pretty icons always all white

Back to my Beyonces

You deserve 3 stacks for the Andre

Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in museums

You belong in Vintage clothes watching the whole building

You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing

You too dope for any of those civilians

Now shoot trigga, stop looking at her tits

Get ya own dog, ya heard

Thats my bitch



[Chorus]

I've been waiting for a long long time

Just to get off and throw my hands up high

And live my life

And live my life

Just to get off and throw my hands up high



Silly little vixen, mixes 'til morning

Not swerving, oh, yeah

Swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion

Stop motion, ooh, yeah



[Kanye West]

You have no idea what you're dealing with

Something on some of this realest shit

Pop some nines, so I give you the Fifth

Something, something, yeah



That's my bitch, That's my bitch

Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch

That's my bitch"

Welcome to the jungle well [x2]
[Kanye West:]
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.

She turned around and looked at me and said ""alive""



[Swizz:]

Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well



[Jay-Z:]

Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes

Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov

Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears

Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs

My uncle died, My Daddy did too

Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move

My nephew gone, My heart is torn

Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born

My faith in God, Every day is hard

Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard



[Kanye West:]

Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God

Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all

So que sera, Get a case of Syrah

Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far



[Jay-Z:]

My dreams is big, Reality set in

Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,

Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas

Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it

I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise

Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5

I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin

I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending

Where the fuck is the sun?

It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son

What happened to my smile?

My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket

I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it

Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low

God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?

I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment

I look in the mirror, My only opponent

Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?

Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed

No crying in public, Just lying to judges

Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well



[Swizz:]

Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well

Goddammit!"

Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
The paper read murder, Black on black murder
The paper read murder, Black on black murder



[Jay-Z:]

This is to the memory of Danroy Henry

Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly

Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team

Giving you respect, I expect the same thing

All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code

I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load

Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be

Power to the people, When you see me, see you



[Kanye West:]

And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital

Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon

Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,

No shop class but half the school got a tool,

And I could die any day type attitude

Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue

It's time for us to stop and re-define black power

41 souls murdered in 50 hours



The paper read murder, Black on black murder,

The paper read murder, Black on black murder again

Murder again...



Is it genocide?

Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized

Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size

The old pastor closed the cold casket

And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs

It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from

I feel the pain in my city wherever I go

314 soldiers died in Iraq

509 died in Chicago



[Jay-Z:]

I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died

Real niggas just multiply

And they say 21 I was supposed to die

So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise

If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival

You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you

What up blood? What up cause?

It's all black, I love us



[Kanye West:]

The paper read murder, Black on black murder again



[Jay-Z:]

It's a celebration of black excellence

Black tie, black Maybachs

Black excellence, opulence, decadence

Tuxes next to the president, I'm present

I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris

In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb

Do you know who I am Clarice?

No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""

Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success

The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast

I repeat, My religion is the beat

My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino

Only spot a few blacks the higher I go

What's up to Will, Shoutout to O

That ain't enough, We gon need a million more

Kick in the door, Biggie flow

I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go



[Kanye West:]

Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go

So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P

From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys

We like the promised land of the OG's

In the past if you picture events like a black tie

What the last thing you expect to see, black guys

What's the life expectancy for black guys?

The system's working effectively, that's why

I'll be a real man and take care of your son

Every problem you had before this day is now done

New crib, watch a movie

Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues

Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci

Now ain't nothin new but your shoes

Sunday morning, Praise the Lord

You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for

So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor

Black excellence, Truly yours"

I told my mama I was on the come up

She said ""you going to school I'll give you a summer""

Then she met NO ID and gave me his number

10 years later she driving a Hummer

Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye

What I do? Turn around gave them beats to Jay

And I'm rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy

I guess I'm getting high off my own supply

Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic

Started a little blog just to get some traffic

Old folks'll tell you not to play in traffic

A million hits and the web crashes - damn!

South Park had them all laughing

Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin'

Ignore the critics just to say we did it

This ain't no fashion show, motherfucker, we live it

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]

I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma

For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana

Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer

Straight out the kitchen, shh don't wake Nana!

Built a republic, that still stands

I'm trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man's

Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this water

The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order

Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up YaYa?

What's that smell? Oh I'm just boiling some aqua

No papa, bad Santa

The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners

I got my liberty, chopping grams up

Street justice, I pray God understand us

I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers

This is the Star Spangled Banner

Oooooh
I love you so
But why I love you

I'll never know [x4]



[Jay-Z:]

Picture if you will, that the throne was burning

Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning

Why does it always end up like this?

Something that we don't determine

Same people that I fought for

That I fight for, that I ride for

That I live for, that I die for

Be the reason that these niggas is alive for

And they want me dead

But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you

But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you

We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th

Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?

When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over

I tried to teach niggas how to be kings

And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers

So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn

So we no longer wear the same uniform

Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller

The castle got bigger, The walls got taller

And truth be told after all that said

Niggas still got love for you



[Chorus: Mr Hudson]

I love you so

But why I love you

I'll never know [x4]



[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]

Showed love to you niggas

You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it

I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it

God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it

Shit feelin' like death don't it

Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it

I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it

Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it

But first I shall digress on it

Wasn't I a good king?

(Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)

Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?

(Huh, I gave you my loyalty)

Made you Royalty and royalties

(Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)

And this is how niggas rewardin me

(Damn)



[Chorus: Mr Hudson]

I love you so

But why I love you

I'll never know [x4]



[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]

Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me

But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me

Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)

And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?

(Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)

Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist

So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit

Am I my brother's keeper?

(Only if that nigga don't creep up)

Got a pistol under my pillow

(I've never been a deep sleeper)

P-p-p-paranoia

(Cause the nigga that said he'll...)

Blast for ya (Is now...)

Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya

(These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)

Please lord (Forgive him)

I loved your point of view cause you held no punches

Still I left you for months on end

It's been months since I checked back in

Well somewhere in a small town, somewhere lockin a mall down

Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down

I can understand why you want a divorce now

Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it

Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with

But deep inside a nigga so sick



[Chorus]

I can't see 'em comin down my eyes

So I gotta make the song cry

I can't see 'em comin down my eyes

So I gotta let the song cry

I can't see it comin down my eyes

So I gotta make the song cry

I can't see it comin down my eyes

So I gotta make the song cry



[Jay-Z]

On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me and My Bitch""

Watchin Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin to be that shit

Empty gun in your hand sayin, ""Let me see that clip""

Shoppin sprees, pull out your Visa quick

A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip

You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6

We was so happy poor but when we got rich

That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped

Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit

Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it

It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick

I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me

Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me

Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy

And then they got fussy and they don't remember that

And I don't remember you..



[Chorus]

I can't see it comin down my eyes

So I gotta make the song cry

I can't see it comin down my eyes

So I gotta make the song cry

Yeah I seen 'em comin down your eyes

But I gotta make the song cry

I can't see it comin down my eyes

So I gotta make the song cry



[Jay-Z]

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone

Word back home is that you had a special friend

So what was oh so special then?

You have given away without gettin at me

That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?

How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?

I know the way a nigga livin was whack

But you don't get a nigga back like that!

Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that

You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that

You don't throw away what we had, just like that

I was just fuckin them girls, I was gon' get right back

They say you can't turn a bad girl good

But once a good girl's goin bad, she's gone forever..

And more forever

Shit I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever



[Chorus]

I can't see 'em comin down my eyes

So I gotta make the song cry

I can't see 'em comin down my eyes

So I gotta let the song cry

I know I seen 'em comin down your eyes

But I gotta make the song cry

I can't see 'em comin down my eyes

So I gotta make the song cry

{*scratched simultaneously: ""It was all a dream"" - B.I.G.*}
[Faith Evans] + (Jay-Z)

Last night I had a dream

Thoughts was racin through my head (it was all a dream)

Felt so real to me

This is what was said..



[Jay-Z]

Had a dream I said, bout who he said?

Bout B.I.G. I said, that's big he said

Dig he said, proceed he said

Indeed I said, so - breathe I did

Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothin

He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this

What I believe to be a yes I re-peated what was said

It came to me like a .. well as even I said

""You feel playboy,"" was the greeting he said

First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?

""More money, more problems, better believe it,"" he said

""Careful what you wish for you might receive it,"" he said

I see I said, jealousy I said

Got the whole industry mad at me I said

Then B.I. said, ""Hov' remind yourself

nobody built like you, you designed yourself""

I agree I said, my one of a kind self

Get stoned every day like Jesus did

What he said, I said, has been said before

""Just keep doin your thing,"" he said, say no more



[Faith Evans]

Was it all a dream - tell me

Was it all a dream, was it a dream

Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

I gotta know {*""It was all a dream""*}

Was it all a dream - was it a dream

Was it all a dream, a dream

Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam



[Notorious B.I.G.]

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine

Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine

Hangin pictures on my wall

Every Saturday, ""Rap Attack,"" Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 

I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped

Smokin weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock 

Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack

with the hat to match 

Remember Rappin' Duke? ""Duh-ha, duh-ha""

You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far

Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight

Time to get paid, blow up like the {**""World Trade""**}

Born sinner, the opposite of a winner

Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner

Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri

Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky

I'm blowin up like you thought I would

Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good

Uhh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga



[Faith Evans]

Was it all a dream - tell me

Was it all a dream, was it a dream

Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

I gotta know {*""It was all a dream""*}

Welcome to the.. Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some

Uhh



Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable

Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)

Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable

Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)



[Jay-Z]

Follow the flow, look

They say a midget standin on the giant's shoulder can see much

further than the giant.. (the giant..)

So I got the WHOLE rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see

further than I am.. (than I am..)

And I have been tryin to be patient with they preoccupation

with David and Goliath.. (Goliath..)

But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course

and I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)

But bein tyrant, comin through your environment

Iron mask, nigga iron gas, nigga I am back

With ""The Team,"" no I in that

R.O.C., y'all not eyein that

Y'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone

""The Dynasty,"" no not Ming but Shawn's

Dame careems, nigga it's the gangsta team

Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene

The other reason, we got a gang of green

If there's better at gettin cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga



WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Jeah, jeah



[Chorus]

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable

Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)

Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable

Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)



Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable..



[Jay-Z]

Jeah, look

I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life

Look behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice

Back to the future and gotta slow up for the present

I'm fast, niggaz can't get past my past

How they propose to deal with my perfect present?

When I unwrap ""The Gift & the Curse"" in one session

Ain't no livin person can test him

Only two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him

Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it

But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it

If you did it I done it before, you get I had it

Got mad at it and don't want it no more

And that goes for everything from flippin that raw

Flippin whores, flippin vocal chords, don't get it twisted

Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice

Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)



[Chorus]



[Jay-Z]

Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone

The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back

You cats overfelt yourself

You couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel

In my absence cats get, absent-minded

Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em

why I'm in the position that I am

changin the game, my game could nail Madonna

Well after I'm gone, they'll honor

history in the makin, Pistol Pete

leave competition shakin without missin the beat

Chasin the hi-hat all over the track

The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!

And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget

The watch face so blue like it's holdin it's breath

Can't see me skill for skill or check for check

It's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck

Live and correct I will bring it to your set

I got now, I don't care who got next

Rapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart

Your flow all y'all usin is mine, you're all useless

You ain't a factor, who are you foolin?

You all are faggots, you takin it backwards (takin it backwards)

I'm tryin to progress with this rap shit

Nigga, nigga your whole career is a accident

Who was gassin 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

Some way we gotta make it up out this life



[Jay-Z]

Weather we dribble out this motherfucker

Rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker

Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker

Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker

Some day the cops will kill a motherfucker

I don't always want to be this drug dealing

Motherfucker damn

Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride

Through the sky I

Use to play the hall up fifth floor me and my boys we

All poor getting high I

seen the worst of the worst I deserve every blessing

I received I'm from the dirt

I planted my seed on unfertile land Myrtle Park

Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand and

Still I grew some how I knew the sun will shine through

And touch my soul take hold of my hand

Look man a tree grows in Brooklyn

I gotta make it up out the hood someday

Some how some way

I gotta make it up out this life

Some way I gotta make it up out this hood someday

Talking:( To old Nell, Sigel street I ain't forget you)



Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck

Nosey neighbors and haters keep their face on stuck

Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up

Behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck

Girls fighting over Rollie young boys hype things up

Niggas fighting over Cold young boys light things up

All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up

Remember Lil' Eddie man how he light mean up

Then they wonder why we light green up

Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't

I lean up ain't the L or the refer that steam up

It's my head stress to the point I get a fever

Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids

That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em

For the rest of their life fucking wings fried

Vegetable rice(gotta be kidding)

No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night

Our kids eating lunch at night

In their beds all bunched in tight

No less than three or four(you know how it go)

Two by the foot two by the headboard

Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)

Thats how I feel for them

And we gotta grip the shorties on the block

All they do is smoke weed and drink forties

Cop their quarties

Enough to get the latest ROC, newest glock, and old Jordies



[Chorus]

Some how some way

We gonna make it up out the hood someday

Some how some way

We gonna make it up out this life

Some how some way

We gonna make it up out the hood one day

Some way we gonna make it up out this life

Right here another lil' story bout this click I claimed

Another chapter based on how I get that game

Hanging round my neighborhood and bang my street

Sit and watch the passer-bys play my sweep

South-side sunny side

Blocks I run South Vegas, South Paul

Nigga all got guns

Over here we got this poor (?) get that there

We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that there

Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps

Working inside a slump house starving to death

Serving these nigga flippers, quarter-ounces and

Zippers agents snapping your picture neighbors

Plotting to get ya

Situations is critic I was out here to get it

Living it like a savage cause nigga I gotta have it

And holding back all the mothers for a minute

Pumping hard dog

Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all dog

Love being willied and your creek gonna rise

I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise

(Some how some way)

(Some how some way)

I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise



[Chorus]

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out the hood some day

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out this life

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out the hood some day

Some way we gotta make it up out this life

Jay-Z this, Jay-Z that (Jay-Z won't hold my hand no more)
Jay-Z this, Jay-Z that
Jay-Z that, Jay-Z this (Jay-Z won't give me no money)
Get off Jay-Z dick
What y'all niggas get front page articles, y'all mention Jay-Z name

(This thing on?) Jay-Z, Jay-Z, in Jay-Z news

I understand what y'all trying to do

I brought the flutes this time, though

I unleashed the flutes on them, guru

Gimme some more music in the headphone

Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening

Let's do this thing (let's do it right this time)

C'mon



H, O V A

I got my mojo back baby, oh behave

Naw, naw, don't be afraid

Y'all and your articles, hard to spit at Jay

Y'all from afar threw thoughts my way

What you thought, I would naught have nothing to say? Nope!

Y'all fell into the booby trap

I set the trap just to see dude react, and now

And now you'se can't leave

You opened the door god, I'm at you annually

And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez

I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is

But you can't give cred to anything dude says

Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head

(Shortyyyy!) It's time to wake up the dead

You sound a little naive in them articles that I read



[Hook] (x2)

H, O V A

The Blueprint 2 baby, on the way

H, O V A

I got my mojo back baby, oh behave



[Jay-Z]

Can't y'all, see that he's fake, the rap version of TD jakes

Prophesizing on your CDs and tapes

Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes

And this is with whom you want to place your faith?

I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine

When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line

Donating proceeds off every ticket sold

When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?

Ain't I supposed to be absorbed myself?

Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help

They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude

To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects

These dudes is all politics, depositing checks

they put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip

And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype

Cause the nigga wear a coofie, it don't mean that he bright

Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice

It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write

Is it ""Oochie Wally Wally"" or is it ""One Mic""?

Is it ""Black Girl Lost"" or shorty owe you for ice?

I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit

Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat

But I will not lose, for even in defeat

There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens it up for me

When the grass is cut, the snakes will show

I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though

Saving me the hassle of speaking to half of these assholes

And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa

I'm back before you had a chance to miss me

My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history

Who you know flow vicious as me?

Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov

I get the spoils cause the victor is me (me, nigga)

You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be

The street dreamin, all y'all niggas living through me

I gave you life when niggas was forgetting you emcee

I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me

You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee

I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen God you a flea

And the little homey Jungle is a garden to me

What's the problem B? You not as hard as me

Nigga hard as we, nigga R O C, nigga

That's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga

I won't rest till you on one knee

You want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga

Until you on one knee, you want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga

Just George Jefferson strollin on 'em, uhh

[Chorus] + ad libs



[Verse Three: Young Chris]

Yo, yo

Y'all don't run up in record labels demandin respect like we

Y'all don't rock your Roc-A-Wear Nike checks like we

Y'all coach class, y'all never private jet like we

My nigga please, y'all don't smoke the sour diesel like us

You don't go to Pop and get ya flour cheaper than us

Knock it off in three hours and repeat it like us

And repeat it we must, y'all don't re-up like us

Thank you, thank you very much 
For comin' out this evening
[Verse 1]
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you

You're far too kind

Hold you're applause 

This is your song not mines

Thank you, thank you, thank you

Please hold your applause

For I just applied logic Keys keys open doors

Now I'm balcony, Opera, Black Tux, Binocula

Black luxe, Stop it I shouldn't be so popular

Name keep poppin' up Face keep poppin' up

On the tube I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up

How would I know HBO would get a shot of us

Sitting so close that we almost got snot on us

Please don't bow in my presence How am I a Legend?

I just got 10 #1 albums Maybe now 11

More hits than a Now! 11 

That is no reason to treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven

Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes 

Thank God, what a guy as I say my grace

Who woulda thought by making birds migrate 

For the winter I be fly all summer Might I say



[Hook]

Thank you, Thank you, thank you You're far too kind

Hold your applause This is your song not mines

Thank you, Thank you, thank you You're far too kind

Do me a favor, don't do me no favors I'll handle mines



[Verse 2]

Hovi Baby

We are really high, really high tonight

We tip the waiter a hundred dollars 

To keep the ice cold, alright?

We the last guys to keep the Wise guys code alive

If I can't live by my word Then I'd much rather die

No no don't thank me, This is just how my suit is stitched

I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits

For the Color Of Money like a Tom Cruise flick

'Cept I put 8-balls in corners without using pool sticks

Beautiful music when champagne flutes click

Beautiful women sippin' throught rouge lips

Dangers approaches We're like wait who's this?

Let us save you some trouble son

What size suit you is?

This way after the Ruger shoots through a few clips

You can lay in your casket just as you is

We appreciate the target practices

We'll be sure to send flower baskets kid



[Repeat Hook]



[Verse 3]

I was gonna kill a couple rappers

But they did it to themselves

I was gon' do it with the flow

But they did it with their sales

I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help

And they did a good job them boys is talented as hell

Cuz not only did they brick they put a building up as well

They ran a plane into that building and when that building fell

Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled

Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled

Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar then took a smell

Cuz they heard that second hand smoke kills

Niggas thought they was ill found out they was...ILL

And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel



[Hook]



[Jay-Z]

Feel it coming in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere

I'm addicted to the the thrill (I'm Ready)

It's a dangerous love affair (C'mon)

Can't be scaring nickels down

Got a problem, tell me now

Only thing that's on my mind

Is who gon' run this town tonight

Is who gon' run this town tonight

We gon' run this town



Jay-Z :



We are, yeah, I said it, we are

This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance

Get y'all fatigues on, all black everything

Black cards, black cars, all black everything

And our girls are blackbirds, riding with they Dillingers

I get more in-depth if you boys really real enough

This is La Familia, I'll explain later

But for now, let me get back to this paper

I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryna get back

I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks

Yeah, I'm talking five comma six zeroes dot zero ?

Back to running circles 'round niggas, now we squared up

Hold up



Rihanna :



Life's a game but it's not fair

I break the rules so I don't care

So I keep doing my own thing

Walking tall against the rain

Victory's within the mile

Almost there, don't give up now

Only thing that's on my mind

Is who gon' run this town tonight

Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay

Who gon' run this town tonight?



Jay-Z :

You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar

Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are

Microphone fiend, it's the return of the God, peace God

And ain't nobody fresher

I'm in Maison, uh, Martin Margiela

On the table, screaming f@#k the other side, they jealous

We got a bankhead full of broads, they got a table full of fellas

And they ain't spendin' no cake

They should throw they hand in, 'cause they ain't got no spades

My whole team got dough

So my bankhead is lookin' like Millionaires' Row

Kanye West :



It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow

To everybody on your dick, no homo

I bought my whole family whips, no Volvos

Next time I'm in church, please no photos

Police escorts, everybody passports

This the life that everybody ask for

This a fast life, we are on a crash course

What you think I rap for? To push a f@#kin' Rav 4?

But I know that if I stay stunting

All these girls only gon' want one thing

I could spend my whole life good will hunting

Only good gon' come is it's good when I'm coming

She got an ass that'll swallow up her G-string

And up top, uh, two bee stings

And I'm beasting, off the re-sling

And my nigga just made it out the precinct

We give a damn about the drama that you do bring

I'm just tryna change the color on your mood ring

Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things

Have you ever had shoes without shoestrings?

What's that, Ye? Baby, these heels

Is that a May-what? Baby, these wheels

You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill

You feelin' like you run it, huh?

Now you know how we feel

The Audemars are yesterday,

Which means your on time delay,

So even if I slow it doooown,

My sound is fast forward, hold up

I'm just a runway show

But I wear this on my plane in my runway clothes,

Cashmere sweats they come out next year

But these my last year sweats,

And my hoe so sick, your new chick can't f-ck with my old b-tch,

And you know this sh-t,

I'm professional, they know this is,

This the blueprint n-gga follow this,

This what what tomorrow is,

Welcome to tomorrow b?-tch,

You about to tell her you love her we off that,

Always wanna fight in the club and we off that,

But you can't bring the future back,

Ya'll steady chasing the fame we off that,

Oversized clothes and chains we off that,

N-gga still making it rain and we off that,

Cause you can't bring the future back,

Tell n-ggas top get off me,

Yeah We off that is you still on that,

If you still making money cause we still on that,



This ain't black versus white my n-gga we off that,

Please tell Bill O Reilly to fall back,

Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls,

It's 2010 not 1864,

Ah yeh we come so far,

So I drive around town hard top and it's off

Ah and my tribeca loft with my high brow art

And my high yellow broad

Ah and my dark skin sis and my best white mate

Say what's up to to chris,

Ah, hows that for a mix,

Got a black president,

Got green presidents,

Blueprints in my white ipod,

Black diamonds in my Jesus piece, My God,

Ah we ain't tripping off that,

It's a benetton ad, n-gga been up off that

I don't give a fidduuck, abiddout the widday,

You used to move, what you used to do,

And I don't give a fidduuck abiddout the b-tches

That you used to screw

What your future do,

And we don't really care what you used to say,

Unless that affects your future pay,

I'm on the practice field running two a day,

So I don't drop the ball when it's threw my way,

So I don't a fidduck abiddout the sh-t that

You probably did,

Who you probably is,

The only time I deal in past tense

Is I'm past rims,

And I'm past tints,

If you driving it I drove it,

You got it cause I sold it,

You copped it and I bought it back,

And we don't give a fidduck n-gga we off that.

I taught 'em about fish scale they want me to fish for them

They want me to catch clean, then cook up a dish for them

All of this just for them, or they got a diss for him

They want me to disappear, like it's gonna shift for them

They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit with them

But what they admitting is, they ain't got shit for him

But really the fact is, we not in the same bracket

Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets

Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches

So how am I in the way, what is it I'm missing?

Nigga I been missing, nigga I been gone

The shit that you just witnessed is in, I bin on

And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it

Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it

Now these nigga's is mad, oh they call me a Camel

But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an animal

Half-man half-mammal

My sign is a Sag, this is just what I plan to do

Hoe don't be mad



[Chorus]



I'm in the hall already, on the wall already

I'm a work of art, I'm a Warhol already

On another level, on another plane already

H-O-V I got my own lane already (already)

I done cooked up the rock already

So why the fuck can't y'all get hot already (already)

Put your name in the pot already, niggas compare me to Biggie and Pac already

Like I'm gone already and I am nigga I'm already home already

If y'all can't already see I ain't worried about y'all cause I'm already me (already)

Do you already, enough of the complaining bo-who's already

Eat food already, ain't nothing given you gotta claim your shoes already,

Yeah so on this summation I don't know who you racing

I'm already at the finish line with the flag waving



[Chorus]



Oh they want me to fall (fall)

Fall from the top (top)

They want me to drop (drop)

They want me to stop (no)

They want me to go (no)

I'm already gone (gone)

The shit that I'm on (already)

I'm already home

(Hey, I'm already home)

(Hey, I'm already home)

All mommies with mind freeze please line up please,
All bloggers with comments,
Please I come in peace,
See if we can kill your amnesia by the time I leave,
All mommies I harbour for vouch for me,

Tell em bout the time all your mommas couch mommy

All hustlas who ever bought an eighth from me,

Take the time out to set the record straight for me,

Remember me, silver bullet hard top mentally

They think think I'm outta shape so I have to jog there memory,

Think with indelible ink, I let the pen go,

Verses permanently tattooed serve as mementos,

Ah, I'm so mental, my track record speaks for itself,

I'm so instrumental,

Allow me to rekindle let's all reminisce like Mary did,

Think I have to send you a reminder,

Here it is,

Cause I can give you a friendly reminder,



Ah,

What the hell have you done,

To even have an opinion on what I been doing,

What the hell have y'all won,

Only thing you can identify with is losing,

10 number 1 albums in a row,

Who better than me?

Only the Beatles nobody ahead of me,

I crush Elvis in his blue suede shoes,

Made the rolling stones seem sweet as coolaid 2,

96, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2001 and beyond,

02, 03, 04, 05, 06 and 7, 08, 09

Men lie women lie, numbers don't,

Ain't nothing changed for me except the year it is,

Do what I done without crying in the environment and what ya'll did it in without dying my n-gga,

Rap like I rap without lying and then tying both together like iron my n-gga,

Write 16's in between running 16 businesses,

All the while showing these young punks what the business is,

As if I'm gonna let you n-ggas style on me,

As if,

Now everybody senile on me,

Go back to boonback,

Remember those button ups,

Young Hov,

Tell them ordinary Joes button up,

I destroy your 4 points O's

And Benz 500 and all points to Ohhhh,

Yeah 3 in the morning on the Westside highway, top down baby,
F-ck y'all
The motivation for me was them telling me what I couldn't be,

Oh well,



[Jay-Z:]

This a special dedication,

I wanna thank you for the fuel,

No really thank you,



I felt so inspired by what my teacher said,

Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head,

Now sure if that's how adults should speak ta kids,

Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class,

I teach his ass,

Even betters what my uncle did,

I pop my demo tape in start to beat my head,

Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his,

He might as well say beat it kid, he's on the list,

It's like I'm searching for kicks like a sneaker head,

He gon keep pushing me until I reach the ledge,

And when I reach the ledge I'll tell em all to eat a d-ck,

Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread,

Spread spread.



[Chorus: Pharrell]

Motivation for me was them telling me what I could not be,

Oh well,

I'm so ambitious,

I might hit two sisters,

Hey I'm on a mission

No matter what the conditions,

Forget the personal issues

When you been what I been through,

Hey if you believe it,

Then you could conceive it.



[Jay-Z:]

I had to lace up my boots even harder,

Father is too far away to father,

Further-more of the kids either smoke reefer,

Or either move white, there's few writers in my cipher,

So they made lighter, my type a dreams seem dumb

They said wise up, how many guys a you see making it from here,

The world don't like us, is that not clear, alright,

But I'm different, I can't base what I'm gonna be off a what everybody isn't, they don't listen, just whispering behind my back,

No vision, lack of ambition,

So wack!



[Chorus]



[Jay-Z:]

Had a couple of meetings no offers yet,

Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices,

Back to the drawing board ducking officers,

It's all good cause the streets is A&R'ing this,

So with or without any of your involvement,

Coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate,

I went from pauper to the President,

Every deal I ever made set precedent,

N-ggas thought I'd fall without old buddy,

Oh buddy, what I do is make more money,

Dear Teacher, your probably somewhere near a speaker,

I'm balling outta control, can you hear my sneakers,

F-ck y'all,

Let's dance for a while,
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever,

We don't have the power but we never say never,

Sitting in a sandpit,

Life is a short trip,

The music's for the sad man,



Forever young,

I wanna be forever young

Do you really want to live forever?

Forever and ever

Forever young I wanna be

Forever young

Do you really want to live forever?

Forever, forever



So we live a life like a video

When the sun is always out and you never get old

And the champagne's always cold

And the music is always good

And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood

And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car

Without a wrinkle in today

Cause there is no tomorrow



Just some picture perfect day

To last a whole lifetime

And it never ends

Cause all we have to do is hit rewind

So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed,

Drink some wine,

Reminisce talk some sh-t forever young is in your mind

Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time

So when the director yells cut,

I'll be fine,

I'm forever young...



Forever young,

I wanna be forever young

Do you really want to live forever?

Forever and ever

Forever young I wanna be

Forever young

Do you really want to live forever?

Forever, forever



Fear not when, fear not why,

Fear not much while we're alive,

Life is for living not living up tight,

See ya somewhere up in the sky,

Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye,

So not for legends, I'm forever young

My name shall survive

Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves,

Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to 

Generations while debating up in barber shops,

Young slung, hung here,

Shorty, the n-gga from here

With a little ambition just what we can become here,

And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears,

Younger kid, younger every year, yeah

So if you love me baby this is how you let me know.

Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby,



Forever young,

I wanna be forever young

Do you really want to live forever?

Forever and ever

Forever young I wanna be

Forever young

Do you really want to live forever?

Forever, forever



Slamming Bentley doors,

Hopping out of Porsche's,

Popping up on Forbes lists,

Gorgeous,

Hold up,

N-ggas thought I lost it,

They be talking bullsh-t

I be talking more sh-t

They nauseous,

Hold up,



I""ll be here forever

You know, I'm on my fall sh-t,

And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit,

Less than four bars,

Guru bring the chorus in,

Did you get the picture yet,

I'm painting you a portrait of young...



Forever young,

I wanna be forever young

Do you really want to live forever?

Forever and ever

Forever young I wanna be

Forever young

Do you really want to live forever?

Forever, forever"

Intuition is there even when my vision's impaired, yeah

Knowin I can go, just switchin a spare

On the highway of life, nigga it's sharp in my sight

Oh! Keen senses ever since I was a, teen on the benches

everytime somebody like Enus was mentioned

I would turn green, me, bein in the trenches

Him, livin adventureous not worryin about expenditures

I'm bravin temperatures below zero, no hero

No father figure, you gotta pardon a nigga

But I'm starvin my niggaz, and the weight loss in my figure

is startin to darken my heart, bout to get to my liver

Watch it my niggaz, I'm tryin to be calm but I'm gon' get richer

through any means, with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture

Never read the Qu'ran or Islamic scriptures

Only psalms I read was on the arms of my niggaz

Tattooed so I carry on like I'm non-religious

Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures

Niggaz, say it's the dawn/Don but I'm superstitious

Shit is as dark as it's been, nothin is goin as you predicted

Look, mindstate of a gangster from the 40's

Meet the vicious mind of motown's Berry Gordi

Turn crack rocks into a chain of 40/40's

Sorry my jewlerys so gordy

Slid into the party with my new pair of Maurys

America meet the gangsta Shawn Corey

Hey young world wanna hear a story?

Close your eyes and you could pretend your me

A cut from the cloth of the kennedys

Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genevees

This is the genesis of a nemesis

Mother america's not witnessing

The harlem renescance birthed black buisnesses

This is the tale of lost innocence

As the inncents burn and the turn tables turn and that Al Greens plays

I see my mother's afro as momma taps her toes as she rolls her jays

And my poppa just left the house, in search of the killer of my Uncle Ray

And she's trying to calm my nerves, as I observe this is just one day

And what tommorow has in store we could never be sure so all we can do is

Pray



[Beyonce: Talking]



[Verse 2: Jay-Z]

As I head towrards my home room I observe the rooms though needles on the ground

I hear a car go vrooom drug dealer in the BM with the top down

As the girls start to giggle I ask why you laugh they say ""you too little""

One day you'll understand when you become a man 'bout things you have to get you

Fast foward freeze frame on my pistol

Fist full of dollers ignorence is so blissfull

I didn't choose this life this life chose me

Around here is the shit that you just do

I just left school, the same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue

They had they guns drawn screaming just move

Unless there something else you suggest we can do

He made his way to the trunk, opened it like a hu

A treasure chest was removed

Cops said he'll be back next month

What we called Kurrup he called paying dues

Now when the rules is blurred as they hears a blurr what am I to do

But pray, pray the lord forgive me

Pray guys goodbye for what I'm a go through

Pray



[Beyonce: Talking]



Anyway this whole pressure into drug confession

Flurrishes like beverages hu refreshing

Sweet taste of sin everything I've seen made me everything I am

Bad drug dealer or I victim I beg

Then came the dawn, and I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all that's all that's all baby
Oh no, I'll never give up on you

I never felt that before

But there's always

That's all that's all

Oh no, I'll never give up on you

I never felt that before

Its just American Dreamin'

Oh no, I'll never give up on you

I never felt that before

Its just American Dreamin'

Oh no, I'll never give up on you

I never felt that before

American Dreamin'

But there's always

That's all that's all



This is the s*** you dream about with the homie steamin' out

Back-back-backing them Beemer's out

Seems as our plans to get a grant

Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out

We need it now, we need a town

We need a place to pitch, we need a mound

For now, I'm just a lazy boy

Big dreaming in my la-z-boy

In the clouds of smoke, been playin' this Marvin

Mama forgive me, should be thinkin' bout Harvard

But that's too far away, n****s are starving

Ain't nothin' wrong with aim, just gotta change the target

I got dreams of baggin' snidd-ow the size of pillows

I see pies everytime my eyes clidd-ose

I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those

Life's a b****, I hope to not make it a widow



[Chorus]



Now see, the life's right there

And it seems right there

Its not quite near,

And its not like we're professionals movin' the decimals

Know where to cop? nah! got a connect? no!

Who under heaven know how to be successful

Need a personal Jesus, I'm in depeche mode

They say its celestial, its all in the stars

Like Tony Caruso, how you played the card

Y'all ain't f***ing with me!

The ironies are, had all coast better before he was bars

Now lets start, on your mark

Get set, lets go-get out the car!

Going in circles, its a vicious cycle

This is a crash course, this ain't high school

Wake up, muttley, you're dreamin' again

Your own reality show, the season begins 



[Chorus]



Step one in this process, scramble up in your projects

And head to the heights where big coke is processed

You gotta convince 'em that you not from the precinct

Please speak slow, cause he no speakey no English

If he takes a liking after a couple of trips

If your money is straight, he's goin' give you consignment

You're now in a game where only time can tell

Survive the droughts, I wish you well

Survive the droughts I wish you well?

How sick am I, I wish you health

I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth

I wish you insight so you could see for yourself

You could see the signs, when the jackets is schemin'

And the cops is comin', you could read they mind

You could see from behind, you could redefine

The game as we know it, one dream at a time

I'm American Dreamin'

Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter fact I learned it all

Burnt it all this music is where I bury the ashes at

Flash back not having much, not having that

Holla that my jewish lawyer do enjoy the fruit of within my cash stack

Sweet, And still there's pain
If I would have grew up
To be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same
But since I grew

Up through the game and my influence is the same

And my therapy is music

They ask if you ashamed

And though I wish I could separate

The two things,

I can not

So my answer to you remains

I can walk down the hall of mirrors

In Versailles

And be so satisfied when I look at my self in the eyes

No shames, No sir

Just Big Boats and tearing the cost up

Tight

Coup like I'm wearin the roadster

For Any coup I'm bear hugging the Holster



[Chorus:]

Hov alright, alright and that may not be

What you call perfect

But, but it's my life

The life, The life, The life

Once again it's

The life



[Verse 2:]

So I make no apologies

Crooked policies, so a G a nigga gotta be

We playing our property, no monopoly

So I'll pass go and let my

Nephew follow me

They say the child shall lead

So I take it far as I can

We then shall see

Shall we dance we dance with the devil

For a beat

I pray

To God I ain't

Got two left feet feet

Do the hustle

Put keys in the street

Then

I'm ballroom dancing

Ke-ke'ing in the suite

Sweet . BB's on the feet

Tv's in

The seat

Enemies on the creeps

It's so corrupt

Soak it, it's a lesson

Never fuck up

One day you're up, next day you down long as u stay the

Same

It will come back around



[Chorus:]

Hov alright, alright and that may not be

What you call perfect

But, but it's my life

The life, The life, The life

Once again it's

The life



[Verse 3:]

I'm even better

I'm eating better

Best thing about it is

My niggas eatin

Together

With each endeavor

We reaching levels

Niggas ain't

Seen in like forever

I'm Hyman Roth I make all my partners rich

I can

Vouch for you

If you ain't a part of this

So pardon me as I pave my wrist

As I parlay chips

Hov

Alright, Alright

AMERICAN GANGSTER, GANGSTER

Business like I'm white

But I'm not I'm just bright

So fly with no fear of the

Flight

So if ya'll hear my plight

And if you think you can make it

This far

Without a fight

Couple mistakes here and there

Not always right

But I'm always

Real

That's how I sleep at night



[Chorus:]

Hov alright, alright and that may not be

What you call perfect

But, but it's my life

The life, The life, The life

Once again it's

The life"

Break Out The Red Lights
The city in bright lights
Welcome To The Party Life
These girls dressin' skintight...

Welcome to the 70's-Sweet!



Ordered some Patreezy

While talkin' to this breezy

Brushin' off my three-piece, I make this look too easy

So tall and lanky, my suit?

It should thank me

I make it look good to be this hood, Meyer Lansky

Look what Lucky left me

Gangster, effortlessly

Poppa was a rolling stone-it's in my ancestry

I'm in a whole 'nother league, niggas never catch me

And I sport fly shit, I should win the ESPY



(Baby I, I said I sport fly shit, I should win the Espy...

I'm really in another league, babe...

I got a slick mouth, you might wanna roll with me,)



I'm on her bra strap, she's on my diiiick

Ain't nothin' wrong with that, that's my biiiitch

I be the boss of that, I'm on her shiiiit

So all you niggas fall back, I'll split ya wig

She's my little quarterback... ya dig?

Cause I'm all that in the sack... ya, ya dig?

I spoiled her

Foiled it if you fakin', Jack

She's used to million-dollar vacations

Fuck ya'll gon' do with that?



When you're blue

You got nothin' to do

(Ay, baby, see,...

When you're used to Filet Mignon,)

Head into the party life

(It's kinda hard to go back to Hamburger Helper...)

If you're feelin' low

We got to go

(It's your choice though, baby...)

Get into the party life



Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?

(Yeah, baby...)

Is you headin' to the party life?

(Is you rollin'?

You can stall out or ball out...)

Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?

Is you headin' to the party life?

(Make a choice...

It's so gangster, baby...)

Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?



Sippin' on my vino

Got me cooler than Pacino

When DeNiro put together my real life it's like CASINO

They should pay me for some B-roll

Takin' G-strokes through the ghee-to

When rap-p-p-pid fire's just a neccesary evil

Hola Hovito', cooler than zero

B-low fresh one blade, no chemo

Art with no easel

Please, it's no equal

Ya boy's off the wall, these other niggas is Tito



Oh...

I like the party life

The city in bright lights

These girls dressin' skintight...

(Damn,...

Ay baby, I said I'm, I'm Off The Wall, I'm like a...

Young Michael Jackson, these other niggas is Tito...

Shout out to Randy, Real Talk!)

You got nothin' to do

Head into the party life

(I might let it ride out for like 7 minutes, you can groove to it, whatever)

If you're feelin' low

We got to go

(Let's two-step... aaow!)

Get into the party life

(Guru, turn the lights down, let's keep it smooth...

This that shit you roll up, like a lil' tight J to...

Sip ya lil' wine...)

Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?

Is you headin' to the party life?

Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?

Is you headin' to the party life?

(whatever your vice is, you know?

Whatever YOU like to do... get into yo' comfort zone, baby...

Get into yo' comfort zone... uh huh)



When you're blue

You got nothin' to do

(Head into the party life...)

Head into the party life

If you're feelin' low

We got to go

(I don't even want it to stop, tho, forreal tho...)

Get into the party life



Step into my bedroom

I call it the Red room

C-cause it gets h-h-hot-t-t

I trust you gon' like it

See, why are we talkin' all this fly shit?

C-c-c-c-cause I'm the flyest

Hovito, baby

No equal, baby

So, petite n' gold

Let the beat go

Now I'm eatin' gold, baby

Hovito, baby

No equal, baby

So, petite n' gold

Let the beat go

Now can we go crazy?...

(Ooh!...)

I ain't playing,

Life's short, so I aimed

I ain't waiting for life to start portrayin' em

It's twice as hard to get a job that's paying

So I ain't payin' attention to what you saying

Rain-drops keep falling on my brain

Constant in the drop, all flames

I'm so hot even if the weather change

I don't have no top, I'm insane

Remember darkskinned Jermaine?

Swayed in the rain, I'm sorta kinda the same

Except I'm no lame and you gonna know my name

Before I go to work and feel my pain

Saying, I'm a bad guy, why's that?

Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga, I react

Secretly though, I know you admire that

You wish you had the balls to fire back-

Say hello, uh, uh, hello, uh. uh

I ain't no ordinary nigga

Look around and see what 'ordinary' gets ya

Extraordinary figures

I'm an extra-ordinary nigga

Before my name became Jigga

Before I sang, I had that thang on sippers

Can't complain bout what they ain't gon' give ya

That ain't gon' get you shit, mightaswell give up

Or get up, get out and get something, nigga

Get a job, my nigga, or get to dumping

Only God can judge him, only he without sin

Can tell me if my means can justify my ends

Til' then, I'm just gon' fly in the benz

Wire my friends through Western Union

Sssshhhh... surprising my sister, knockin'

Here comes the bad guy again!

We ain't thugs for the sake of just being thugs

Nobody do dat where we grew at, nigga, DUH!

The poverty line, we not above

So out come the mask and glove cause we ain't feelin' the love

We ain't doing crime for the sake of doing crime

We movin' dimes cause we ain't doin' fine

One out of three of us is locked up doing time

You know what that type of shit can do to a nigga mind?

My mind on my money, money on my mind

If you owe me ten dollars, you ain't giving me nine

Ya'll ain't give me 40 acres and a mule

So I got my Glock 40, now I'm cool

And if Al Sharpton is speaking for me

Somebody get him the word and tell him I don't approve

Tell him I'll remove the curses

If you tell me our schools gon' be perfect

When Jena 6 don't exist

Tell him THAT's when I'll stop saying bitch-BIIITCH!

Let that bitch breathe!
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less

What do I think of success

It sucks too much to stress

I guess I blew up quick, cause friends I grew up with

See me as a primi, but I'm not and my nut's big

I don't know what the fuss is

My career is illustrious

My rep is impeccable

I'm not to be fucked with, with shit

Let that bitch breathe!

I'm way too important to be talking extorting

Asking me for a portion is like asking me for a coffin

Broad daylight I off ya on switch

Ya not too bright, goodnight, long kiss,

Bye-bye, my reply, blah-blah

Blast burner then pass burner, to TyTy

Finish my breakfast, why?

I got an appettite for destruction and you're a small fry

Now where was I

Let that bitch breathe!

I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more

Truth be told, I had more fun when I was piss poor

I'm pissed off, is this what success all about

A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths

All this stress, all I got is this big house

Couple cars, I don't bring half of them shits out

All this ace of spade I drank, just to piss out

I mean I like the taste, could have saved myself six hours

How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu

Hold up, let me move my bowels

I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG tell these boys



[Juan:]

Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga



[Jay-Z:]

I got watches I ain't seen in months

Apartment at the Trump I only slept in it once

Nigga said Hova was over, such dummies

Even if I fell I land on a bunch of money

Y'all ain't got nothing for me

Nas, let that bitch breathe!



[Nas:]

Success, McLaren, women starin'

My villain appearance

Sacred blood of a king

In my vein ain't spillin'

Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill, Romero

Camaro driven

I climax from paper then ask why is life worth livin'

Is it the hunt for the shit that you want

To receive is great but I lust giving

The best jewelers want to make my things

I make Jacob shit on Lorraine, just to make me a chain

Niggas mention of one love, came home to paper in hand

Ain't got to brag about the feds young man

Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments

Google Earth Nas, I got flats in other continents

Worst enemies want to be my best friends

Best friends want to be enemies, like that's what's in

But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den

Take everybody's chips, about to cash them in

Up your catalogue dog, mines worth too much

Like Mike Jack's ATV Pub, Mottola can't touch

Let this bitch breathe!

Home of the heroine,
Error of the hustlers, uh
The world is my custy
New rich porter
The way I flip quarters

Front on all these other rap artists, but me

Momma was a mink wearer, Papa ran numbers

So it's plain to see, where my whole plan come from

American dream, I'm living the life still

The way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill

Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining

40 below timbs on, getting my M's on

My best friends gone, I seen bad days

Still find songs that I hear him on

Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on

I hear his voice in my mind, like, nigga live on

So I get on that fly shit I been on

Spin on corners in enzo with rims on

But for info, puffin on Endo-Nesia

Give me amnesia

I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga

I want the sky,

The world when I'm done

I'm give it to my sons

Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up,

Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done

The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame, a list of hits next to all my names

I came, if the sky should fall

And it all goes tomorrow, and they foreclose on the house and auction off all my cars

Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the beamer

Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardina

In Ibiza I had pizza in the club

Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love

Now they wanna ya boy like Mike in his prime

Billie Jean the goddamn boy ain't mine

And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope

Can't lie they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes

Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's

Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo

Rose gold rose flow, I'm okay though

What Don't kill me makes stronger than before so

Here we go and I'm not domino

When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw

I might break but I don't fold, till I hold the sky in my hand

Yeah that's my goal

And then I bid you Freddy Adu

Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the future

Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle

My name will be viewed such

Here's to the man that refused to give up

I want the sky nigga, Chuuuuuuch"

The King will Come, I'm ready

I'm ready



Now everywhere I go they like Hovi back

Up out the corner office of cul-de-sac

Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat

Get your swag back daddy where your focus at?

Got to admit a lil' bit I was sick of rap

But despite that the boy is back

And I'm so evolved,I'm so involved

I'm showin' growth I'm so in charge

I'm CEO and yeah goin' God

I'm so indebted I should of been debted

Sellin' blow in the park this is knowin' my heart

Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark

I been up in the office you might know him as Clark

Just when you thought the whole world fell apart, I

Take off the blazer loosen up the tie

Step inside the booth Superman is alive

I will be... King of New York

I will be... New York

Not only NYC I'm hip hop's savior

When Kingdom Come, You ready?

Not only NYC I'm hip hop's savior

So after this flow you might owe me a favor



I hear ""Hurry up Hov"" when I'm out in the public

These niggas like that you love it you be it your of it

You breathe it we need it bring it back for the hustlers

Have you dust off the hammer dance can't touch this

C'mon playboys bring your cars back out

Cause your boy Hov is back you know them broads comin' out

Got 'em dancin' on the banquett like they from Bankhead

Fuck crystal so they ask what we drinkin'

I thought dudes were marquess rudoque

So I moved on to don 

And it's much bigger issues in the world I know

But I first had to take care of the world I know

I'm from the bottom so I still feel im from the bottom

Underdog before my cake and still couldn't stop him

Flash Gordon bring my cords and spark the light in the dark

Peter Park Spider-Man all I do is climb the charts art



[Chorus]



Just when they thought it was all over

I put the whole world on my back in broad shoudlers the ball hover

Who you know took over tracks like that

Guess what New York New York we back

And I ain't never been afraid of a drought

Since I was 6 17 they gettin' money down south

Bout it-Bout it Master P

Ask the nigga Pimp C ask my homie Bun B

I run the streets the streets don't run we

Y'all run we chill still waters run deep

I repeat sing along with me

I run the streets the streets don't run we

Ladies sayin' where you been Superman

When niggas spendin' 10 million and media on my hands

The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear

When you need me just throw your Roc signs in the air, yeah

Uh, uh, uh, uh
It's not a diss song, it's just a real song
Feel me?

I heard motherfuckers saying they made Hov

Made Hov say, ""Ok so, make another Hov""

Niggaz wasn't playing they day role

So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo

I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though

I put friends over business end of the day though

But when friends, business interests' day-glow

Ain't nothing left to say though

I guess we forgot what we came fo'

Shoulda stayed in food and beverage

Too much flossing

Too much Sam Ralstein

I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them

Hov have to get the shallow shit up off him

And I ain't even want to be famous

Niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes

And I ain't even know how it came to this

Except that fame is

The worst drug known to man

It's stronger than, heroin

When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""

And still not see, what you've become

I know I'm guilty of it too but, not like them

You lost one



[Chorus: Marsha (Jay-Z)]

Lose one, let go to get one

Left one, lose some to win some (You lost one)

Sorry I'm a champion, sorry I'm a champion

You lost one



I don't think it's meant to be, be

But she loves her work more than she does me

And honestly, at twenty-three

I would probably love my work more than I did she

So B, ain't we

It's me, and her

'Cause what she prefers over me, is work

And that's, where we, differ

So I have to give her

Free, time, even if it hurts

So breathe, mami, it's deserved

You've been put on this earth to be

All you can be, like the reserves

And me? My timing is on me, it's served

So I have to allow she, her, time to serve

The time's now for her

The time she'll mature

And maybe we, can be, we, again like we were

Finally, my time's too short to share

And to ask her now, it ain't fair

So yeah, she lost one



Lose one, let go to get one

Left one, lose some to win some (Oh yeah, she lost one)

Sorry I'm a champion, sorry I'm a champion

You lost one



I never died in the car I bought

So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault

Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought

Place any burden on me, but please, not that lord

Time don't go back, it go forward

Can't run from the pain, go towards it

Some things can't be explained, what caused it?

Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit

Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it

That time, little man I'm nauseous

Your girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift

Almost lost my faith, that restored it

It's like having your life restarted

Can't wait for your child's life, to be a part of it

So now I'm child-like, waiting for a gift

To return, when I lost you, I lost it



Lose one, let go to get one

Left one, lose some to win some (Colleek, I lost one)

Sorry I'm a champion, Colleek, you're a champion

You lost one"

Show young boys how to do this thing
The maturation of Jay-Z-Z . . heh

Check me out . . .



[Verse 1]

30's the new 20 nigga I'm so hostile (Uhh)

Better broad, better automobile (Uhh)

Bet a yard (Naw!) Bet a hundred mil

Then by the songs end I'll probably start another trend

I know ev'ry thing you wann' do

I did all that by the age of twenty-one

By twenty-two, I had that brand new Ac' coupe

I guess you could say that my livin' just begun, I'm--

Young enough to know the right car to buy

Yet grown enough not to put rims on it

I got that six-duece with curtains, so you can't see me

And I didn't even have to put tints on it

I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch

I don't buy out the bar, I bought the nightspot

I got the right stock, I-- got--

Stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops

I know you like FUCK! this is child abuse

Call DYFS, I must just be getting nicer

And young boys ain't ready fa' real

30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so ho-stile



[Chorus 1]

I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck

Baby boy, now I'm all grown up

I used to cruise the used car lot, put crome on the truck

Baby boy, now I'm all grown up

I used to play the block like dat (like dat)

I used to carry knots like dat (like dat)

Now I got Black cards, good credit and such

Baby boy 'cause I'm all grown up



[Verse 2]

30's the new 20 nigga, I'm on fire still

These young boys is like a fire drills (Uhh)

False alarms (Uhh), the next don (Naw)

He ain't got it (Uhh), on to the next one (Young)

Still here (Yeah), still here like Mike--

Gotta stop playin' with these children (Chea)

I'm a bully with the bucks (boots)

Don't let the patent leather shoes fool you young'n

I got the fully in the tux

That was my past, now I'm so grown up

I don't got one gun army

Gotta a sum army to hire a gun army, get ya spun like laundry

And I'll be somewhere under palm trees, calmly listenin' to R&B

When we get the call he's, no longer wit' us, fire ya babysitters

You little fucks fall back fa' real

30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so ho-stile



[Chorus 2]

I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck

Baby boy, now I'm all grown up

I used to cruise the used car lot, put crome on the truck

Baby boy, now I'm all grown up

I used to wear my hoodie like that (like that)

Pile deep in a hooptie like that (like that)

Now I got Black cards, good credit and such

Baby boy 'cause I'm all grown up



[Verse 3]

(heh-heh-heh)

Ya'll roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day

Ya'll youngin's chase, I'm Patron an' it's great

I like South Beach, but I'm in St. Tropez

Ya'll drink Dom, but not Rosé (hey)

Ya chick shop at the mall--

My chick burn it down Bergdorf's

Comin' back with Birkin bags

Ya chick is like, ""What type of purse is that?""

I'm from the era where niggas don't snitch

You from the era where snitchin' is the shit

I'm afraid of the future (why?)

Ya'll respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter

Ya'll go to parties to ice grill

I go to parties to party with nice girls

Young boys gotta chill

30's the new 20 nigga, Im so ho-stile



[Chorus 3]

I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck

Baby boy, now I'm all grown up

I used to cruise the used car lot, put crome on the truck

Baby boy, now I'm all grown up

Ya, we used to ball like that (like that)

Now we own the ball team, holla back (holla back)

Now I got Black cards, good credit and such

Come on bring the chorus in



1 - I'd risk everything

For one kiss, everything

Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)

Anything for you



I'd do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trustin' that

Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours

Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa

Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall

My brother from anotha pop, minus one shot

We Neno and G-Money man, we all we got

From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops

And us gettin mad, throwin' rocks off the roof

Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress

But look at us now man, we're young execs

My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Tah

My nigga Ja, my nigga Gotti

We embody all that's right with the world

No matter how pretty she is, you never likin' my girl

That's how we run, when you ain't around

I'll spank ya son, keep him in line

If you should die, I'll keep him like mine

God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga



Repeat 1

Repeat 1



I know mama, your little baby

But these streets raised me crazy

Product of my environment, nothing can save me

Thanks for letting me bloom for your wisdom for your womb

For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed

For the most important lesson in life was when you said

""Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them""

Thanks for the days you kept me breathing when my asthma was bad

And my chest was weezin', thanks for the look of love

Just as I was leavin'

On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back

That left you grieving'

Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad

As the man, I apologize for my dad

When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do

That wasn't the life meant for you

You're a queen, you deserve the cream

Everything that gleamed, everything that shines

Everything that's mine



Repeat 1

Repeat 1



Check it out, uh, uh

Dear nephews, I'm writing' this with no pen or a pad

And I'm signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad

Don't look back if you fall and you're feeling bad

I'm right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab

If it comes a time when you ain't feelin' your real dad

Put my face on his body don't wait for nobody

Don't follow no nigga, that's hoe shit man

Stand on your own two, do your shit man

The world is yours

Some girls are nice some girls are whores

Don't listen to your crew

Do what works for you

Standin' back from situations gives you the perfect view

You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass

Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said

Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed,

You know my number when it's code red if you're wrong my nigga

You're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

It ain't for everybody 
Welcome to Hollywood baby 
-Take my picture 
You comin with? 

-Let's not even talk about it 

Let's do it 

-Let's go 



[Beyonce:] 

I see your jealousy as you're watching (I see you watching) 

You're watching ( It's all good) 

It's kinda sexy to me (I Love it) 

How you're watching, you're watching 

I see your face (i see your face) 

You want to touch it (you want to touch it) 

Come to my place (come to the crib) 

And let's discuss it (let's chop it up) 

Tonight you'll be (tonight you 'gon be a superstar baby) 

A superstar 

Come let me sign you up (let's get into it) 



[Chorus:] 

Ooh it's the lights (you're blinded by the...) 

Action! (you need that...) 

Hollywood (Uh Uh Uh Uh) 

Ooh it's the lights (you're blinded by the...) 

Satisfaction (you need that...) 

Hollywood (Uh Uh Uh Uh c'mon) 



[Verse 1:] 

Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high rise 

I hide, behind my shades because the fame is blindin my eyes 

My god, I know how Ozzy Oz must have felt when he was outside 

Cuz i have got, i have got to make this stop 

People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart 

It'll change those cuz if they had love for you into strangers 

When the fame starts, it's a chain reaction 

Locomotion like when a train departs 

Stranger things have happened 

Rappin stackin platinum plaques 

Born in Brooklyn, Got a place in Manhattan 

Goin back to Brooklyn to escape the madness 

When your friends is Chris & Gwyneth when your girl is more famous than you 

Then it's time to get all your windows tinted 

Keep your eyes squinted it's gon flash any minute 

The music biz is like musical chairs 

It's about where you stand when the music stop spinnin... 



[Chorus] 



[Beyonce:] 

You got to get it (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 

Do you want it? (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 

But you don't need it (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 

'Til you do, 'til you do (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 



[verse 2:] 

Hey Mister, page sixer 

A-Lister, you're in the midst of 

The ride of your life, but you gotta keep them hits up 

Can't put your guard down, gotta keep your mits up 

Take a sip sir, it's so intoxicating ain't it? 

Try not to get jaded 

Hollywood's been good to ya 

Startin to feel like buzz to ya 

Don't lie, go on fly, you're addicted to the light 

Without the fame, how you gon' survive? 

It's like bein on heroin, you so high 



[Beyonce:] 

And everybodyies warning you about it (I tried to told you) 

And once you taste it you can't live without it (It's addicting) 

Not cuz you choose to not live without it (you sure you want this baby) 

It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (It's a part of you) 

And everybodies warning you about it 

And once you taste it you can't live 



[chorus] 



[verse 3:] 

Wanna be seen now, groupies 

Now you've become what you once despised 

James Dean, John Belushi, blow your whole life trying to live in the lights 

Heroin's following, Marijuane hopping over the edge 

It's like Janis Joplin 

River Pheonix, Jimi Hendrix 

Jimmy Morrison all of them ended by Hollywood 

Thank God for Hollywood 

Hollywood... 

you sure you want this baby? 

Hollywood, it's the most addicting drug in the world 

You want the fame 

You want the lights"

Please explain this shit to me, How is it logical?

Have we forgot our history? lets open our bibles

Its like the disciples dissing Jesus becoming his rivals

Shunning teh one thing that they owe their life to

You let that man hype you to go against your idol

Knowing good and god damn well this what I do

Think I'm in the office I lost my grind

Thats how kids become orphans, YOU LOST YOUR MIND!?

I keep my enemies close

I give 'em enough rope

They put themselves in the air

I just kick away the chair



UH

UH

We gon' see now

UH HUH

We gon' see clown

Dig a hole

Dig a hole

Go 'head, burry yourself

Dig a hole

Dig a hole

Go 'head, Burry yourself



Hov gon' get you, I aint forget your little disrespect

NO Hov, daddy gon' spank your for that shit you said

It's hard to do, when you got nothin to prove

Everbody know you better, you in a lose lose

Even if you win, ultimately you lose

Real niggahz like, ""why Hov talkin to dude""

He's sellin low too

Only time you went plat

My chain was around yout neck, thats an actual fact

So I'm praying that it spills outside of the Booth

Thats when y'all niggahz outside of your truth

Outside of your league, thats not what you do

Niggahz throwing ROC signs outside of your coupe

[Laughs]

Dun look at Hove like he dun somethin wrong to em

He just took what belong to em

Niggahz playing Checkers wid Chess playing Hov

This game is over I dunno if y'all know

You in a hole



We gon' see now

Uh Huh

We gon' see clown

Dig a hole

Dig a hole

Go 'head, burry yourself

Dig a hole

Dig a hole

Go 'head, burry yourself"

People were poor before the hurricane came, for the down pour poured like maryy J sang
every day it rains, so every day the pain, let em ignore them, showed em the rents was the plain...
for life is a chain, cause and effected, niggas on the chain because the effected

its a dirty game so whatever its effective...from weed to selling kane, got put that into effect..shii

wouldn't you loot if you didn't have the loot, babby needed food and u stuck on the roof, helicopter 

swooped down just to get a scoop, through his telescopic lens but he didn't scoop you..

the next 5 days no help ensued, they called you a refuge because you seek refuge..the commander and chief just flew by, stop no he had a couple seats, just through...jet blue he is not, jet blue by the spot, but if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped..hah

that would have been something to watch helicopters doing fly bys to take a couple of shots, couple of portraits that ignored em 

he'd be just another bush surrounded by orkids...poor kids just because they were poor kids, left em on their porches same old story in new orleans...silly rappers, because we got a couple porches, mtv stopped by to film my fortressess, we forget the infortunate, sure pony'd up a meal, but i didn't give my time, so in reality i didn't give a dime or a damn, i just put my moneys' in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded...nutta but a bandid left them folks abandoned, damn...that money that we gave was just a bandaid kiss and said that we're better off then we were before..in synopsis this is my minority report..can't say we better then we are better off then we were before...in synopsis this is my minority report...



So many times i'm coverin my eyes, winking through my fingers , tryin to hide my ..frustration at the way that we treat (seems like we don't even care) 



Turn on the tv...seein the pain..censored, such a shame...just tryin to go on with my life...of that i to am guilty (seems like we don't even care) 



So send a little money, and tell them its alright .... To be able to sleep at night, you will pay that price while some of these folks lost their whole life (seems like we don't even care) Now it wasn't on the nightly news no more, so it really didn't matter to u no more...in the end almost nothing has changed, what the hell...what was that for? 

(seems like we don't even care)"

[Verse One]
Life is but a dream to me
I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up

So I'm about my paper

24/7, 365,366 in a leap year

I don't know why we here

Since we gotta be here

Life is but a beach chair

Went from having shabby clothes

Crossing over Abbey Roads

Hear my angels singing to me

Are you happy HOV?

I just hope im hearing right

Karma's got me feearing life

Colleek are you praying for me

I got deamons in my past

So i got daughters on the way

If the prophecy's correct

Then the child should have to pay

For the since of a father

So i barter my tommorows

Against my yesterdays

In hopes that she'll be OK

And when im no longere here

The shade of face from the flare

I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter

and a shiny new beach chair



[Verse Two]

Life is but a dream to me

Gun shots sing to these

Other guys but lullabys

Don't mean a ting to me

I'm not afraid of dyng

I'm afraid of not trying

Everyday hit every wave

Like im Hawaiian

I don't surf the net

No i never been on myspace

Too busy letting my voice vibrate

Carving out my space

In this world of fly girls

Cutthroats & diamond cut ropes I twirls

Benzs round corners

Where the sun don't shine

I let the wheels give a glimpse

Of hope of one's grind

Some said HOV, how you get so fly

I said from not being afraid to fall out the sky

My physical's shell

So when i say farewell

My soul will find an even

Higher plane to dwell

So fly you shall

So have no fear, just know that

Life is but a beach chair



[Verse Three]

Life is but a dream Can't mimic my life

I'm the thinnest cut slice

Intercut, the winner's cup

With winters rough enough

TO interrupt life

That's why I'm both

The saint & the sinner

Nice

This is Jay everyday

No compromise

No compass comes with this life

Just eyes

So to map it out

You must look inside

Sure books can guid you

But your heart defines you

Chica

You corason is what brought us home

In great shape like Heidi Klum

Maricon, I am on

Permanent Vaca

Life is but a beach chair

This song is like a Hallmark card

Until you read each here

So till she's here

And she declaired

The aire

I will be prepared

A blueprint for you to print

A map so you can back

A guide for your eyes

And so you won't lose scent

I'll make a stink for you to think

I ink these verses full of prose

So you won't get connect out of 2 cent

My last wil and testament I leave my heir

My share of Roc-AFella Records and a shiny new beach chair"

Sean Carter was born December 4th
Weighing in at 10 pounds 8 ounces
He was the last of my 4 children
The only one who didn't give me any pain when i gave birth to him
And that's how i knew that he was a special child



[Jay-Z Verse 1]

They say ""they never really miss you til you dead or you gone""

So on that note i'm leaving after the song

So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long

Atleast let me tell you why i'm this way, Hold on

I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adaness Revees

Who made love under the Siccamore tree 

Which makes me

A more sicker emcee my momma would claim

At 10 pounds when i was born i didn't give her no pain

Although through the years i gave her her fair share

I gave her her first real scare

I made it from birth and i got here

She knows my purpose wasn't purpose

I ain't perfect i care

But i feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear

Now i'm just scratchin the surface cause what's burried under there

Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared

I went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted

But i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted

Hold on



[Jay-Z's Mom:]

Shawn was a very shy child growing up

He was into sports

And a funny story is

At 4 he taught hisself how to ride a bike

A two wheeler at that

Isn't that special?

But, i noticed a chance in him when me and my husband broke up



[Jay-Z Verse 2]

Now all the teachers couldn't reach me

And my momma couldn't beat me

Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me, SO

With that distain in my membrain

Got on my pimp game

Fuck the world my defense came

Then Dahaven introuced me to the game

Spanish Jose introduced me to cane

I'm a hustler now

My gear is in and i'm in the in crowd

And all the wavey light skinned girls is lovin me now

My self esteem went through the roof man i got my swag

Got a volvo from this girl when her man got bagged

Plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had

Supposedly knowin nobody paid Jaz wack ass

I'm geting ahead of myself, by the way, i could rap

That came second to me movin this crack

Gimme a second i swear

I will say about my rap career

Til 96 came niggas i'm here

Good-bye



[Jay-Z's Mom:]

Shawn use to be in the kitchen

Beating on the table and rapping

And um, until the wee hours of the morning

And then i bought him a boom box

And his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts

But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble



[Jay-Z Verse 3]

Good-bye to the game all the spoils, the adreneline rush

Your blood boils you in a spot knowing cops could rush

And you in a drop your so easy to touch

No two days are alike

Except the first and fifteenth pretty much

And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us

Hustlers we don't sleep we rest one eye up

And the drought to find a man when the well dries up

You learn to work the water without workin thirst til die YUP

And niggas get tied up for product

And little brothers ring fingers get cut up

To show mothers they really got em

And this was the stress i live with til i decided

To try this rap shit for a livin

I Pray i'm forgiven

For every bad decision i made

Every sister i played

Cause i'm still paranoid to this day

And it's nobody fault i made the decisions i made

This is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me



If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack

Maybe you'll love me when i fade to black



If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack

Maybe you'll love me when i fade to black

[repeat 2 more times to fade]"

Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar



Now what the hell are you waitin for

After me, there shall be no more

So for one last time, nigga make some noise



[Verse One]

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that

The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at

Can't none of y'all mirror me back

Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime

I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead

Back to take over the globe, now break bread

I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express

Out the country but the blueberry still connect

On the low but the yacht got a triple deck

But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep

Grand openin, grand closin

God your man Hov' cracked the can open again

Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen

just draw off inspiration

Soon you gon' see you can't replace him

with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS



[Chorus] - 1/2



{What the hell are you waiting forrrr?}



[Verse Two]

{*sighs*} Look what you made me do, look what I made for you

Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you

When you first come in the game, they try to play you

Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you

From Marcy to Madison Square

To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)

As fate would have it, Jay's status appears

to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye

When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5

It ain't to play games witchu

It's to aim at you, probably maim you

If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens

Cocksucker take one for your team

And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)

I came, I saw, I conquered

From record sales, to sold out concerts

So muh'fucker if you want this encore

I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore



[Interlude]

OWWWW! It's star time

This man is MADE! He's KILLIN all y'all jive turkeys

Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?

Well if y'all want more of the Jigga man

Then I need y'all to help me, bring him back to stage

Say Hova, c'mon say it!

HO-VA! HO-VA! Are y'all out there? {*crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""*}

Are y'all out there? C'mon, louder!

Yeah, now see that's what I'm talkin bout

They love you Jigga - they love you Jigga!



[Jay-Z]

I like the way this one feel

It's so muh'fuckin soulful man!

(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)

Yeah {*crowd still chanting*} okay



[Verse Three]

So this here is the victory lap

Then I'm lea-vin, that's how you get me back

After a year of them 16's, it's one point two

And that's two point four, and I'm only doin two

You wanted to gain attention new dudes

I can get you BET and TRL too

You wanna be in the public, send your budget

Well fuck it, I ain't budgin!

Young did it to death, you gotta love it

Record companies told me I couldn't cut it

Now look at me, all star-studded

Golfer above par like I putted

All cause the shit I uttered, was utterly ridiculous

How sick is this?

You want to bang, send Kanye change, send Just some dust

Send Hip a grip, then you got' spit

A little somethin like this, WOO!

Tell the whole world the truth is back

You ain't gotta argue about who can rap

Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps

New York, New York! Yeah, where my troopers at?

Where my hustlers, where my boosters at?

I don't care what you do for stacks

I know the world glued your back to the wall

You gotta brawl, do that

I been through that, been shot at, shoot back

Gotta keep a peace/piece like a Buddhist

I ain't a +New Jack+, nobody gon' Wesley Snipe me

It's less than likely, move back

Let I breathe, Jedi Knight

The more space I get the better I write, ohh

Whenever I write, but, if, ever I write

I need the space to say whatever I like, now I just

{And girl I promise you, no substitutions} Just me



[Verse Two]

And I ain't gon' tell you again, let's get ghost in the phantom

You can bring your friend, we can make this a tandem

Or you can come by yourself if you can stand him

Best believe, I sweat out weaves

Give +Afro Puffs+ like R.A.G.E.

Haul-U get a view could move it

Back it on up like a U-Haul truck

Then run and tell them ducks you heard Hovi new shit

He and the boy Phar-real make beautiful music

He is to the East coast what Snoop is

To the West, what 'Face is to Houston

Young Hov' in the house is so necessary

No bra with that blouse, that's so necessary

No panties and jeans, that's so necessary

Now why you frontin on me, is that necessary?

Do I, to you, look like a lame

I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song

I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along

Now it's a duet, and you wet, when you check out

the technique from the 2 tecs and I don't need two lips

To blow this like a trumpet you dumb shit

This is a un-usual musical I conductin

You lookin at the black Warren Buffett so all critics can duck sic

I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it

Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rylin me up

For three years, they had me peein out of a cup

Now they bout to free me up, whatchu think I'm gon' be, what?

Rehabilitated, man I still feel hatred

I'm young black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but

You never had me like Christina Aguiler-y

But catch me down the Westside, drivin like Halle Berry

Or the FDR, in the seat of my car

Screamin out the sunroof death to y'all

You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars

I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head

Change your face or the bullets change all that for you

Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's ""Money, Cash, Hoes""
I'm from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those?

If you grew up with holes in your zapper toes

You'd celebrate the minute you was havin dough

I'm like fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole

If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward

Got beef with radio if I don't play they show

they don't play my hits - well I don't give a shit, SO!

Rap mags try and use my black ass

So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers!

bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor

Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case

So I, pull over to the side of the road

license and registration and step out of the car -

are you carryin a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are""

I ain't steppin out of shit, all my papers legit

""Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""

Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back

And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that

""Aren't you sharp as a tack! You should try out

for lawyer or somethin, somebody important or somethin""

Child I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit

Enough that you won't illegally search my shit

""Well we'll see how smart you are when the canine comes""

Now once upon a time, not too long ago

A nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe

This is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy

But a pussy havin no God damn sense, try an' push me

I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord

Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform

You know the type, loud as a motorbike

But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight

And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin and

he and his boys gon' be yappin to the Captain

And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again

Back through the system with the riff-raff again

Fiends on the floor, scratchin again

Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin them

D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again

Half a mill' for bail cause I'm African

All because this fool was harassin them

{""Lucifer Lucifer, don of de morning..""}



[Jigga] So you need to change your attitude

[Jigga] For they askin what happened to you



[Verse One]

Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him

But he also got a righteous cause for sinnin

Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder-dem

First emergency, doctors performin procedures

Jesus, I ain't tryin to be facetious, but

""Vengeance is mine"" said the Lord

You said it better than all

Leave niggaz on death's door, breathin on

res-por-rators for killin my best, poor haters

On permanent, hi-atus as I skate

in the Maybach Benz, fly this guy leavin

Pumpin ""Brown Sugar"" by D'Angelo

In Los Angeles, like an evangelist

I can introduce you to your maker

Bring you closer to nature

Ashes after they cremate you bastards

Hope you been readin your Psalms and chapters

Payin your tithe, bein good Catholics, I'm comin

[Jigga] So you niggaz change your attitude

[Jigga] For they askin what happened to you



[Verse Two]

Yes, this is holy war

I wet y'all all with the holy water

Spray from Heckler-Koch order

Matic auto-static, child cease to exist

like a sabbatical, I throw couple at you, take six!

Spread love, to all of my dead thugs

I pour out a little Louis, to a head above

Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the earth

'Til that time, it's on and poppin, CHURCH

Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either

Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost

Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral

for stuntin like Evel Knievel

I let you see where that bright light lead you

The more you talk, the more you irkin us

The more you gon' need memorial services

""The Black Album"" second verse, is like

Devil's pie, save some dessert for us



[Interlude]

Man, I gotta get my soul right, uhh

I gotta get these devils out my life, uhh

These cowards gonna make a nigga right, uhh

They won't be happy 'til somebody die, uhh

Oh man, I gotta get my soul right, uhh

'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life, uhh

Every time it seems it's alright

Somebody want they soul to rise

I chase you off of this earth



[Verse Three]

Let me get serious for y'all, one second

I got dreams, of holdin a nine milla, to Bob's killer

Askin him why as my eyes fill up

These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow

Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel you

So, curse the day that birthed the bastard

who caused your church mass, reverts to crash

The first to blast then reverse the curse

The first to date and there you are, Bob Allah

Lord forgive him, we all have sinned

But Bob's a good dude, please let him in

And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge

Please blame it on the son of the mornin', thanks again"

Once again it's the life, yessss
(I don't know why, I.. get so high on)
It's intoxicatin man, y'all don't know why you do what you do
(Get so high on, get so high - high off the life)

[Verse One]

The allure of breakin the law

Is always too much for me to ever ignore

I gotta thing for them big body Benzes, it dulls my senses

In love with a V-Dub engine

Man I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted

Bey Venay kicks, or them Marvin Kaye wrists

My women friend get tennis bracelets

Trips to Venice, get they winters replaced with

the sun, it ain't even fun no more I'm jaded

Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it

I put my feet in the footprints left to me

Without sayin a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy

Man my brother hustled so, naturally

Up next is me, but what perplexes me

Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play

the starrin role in ""Hovito's Way""



[Chorus]

It's just life, I solemnly swear

To change my approach, stop shavin coke

Stay away from hoes, put down the toast

Cause I be doin the most.. oh no!

But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back

It called me right back, man it called me right back - oh no!



[Verse Two]

I'm like a Russian mobster, drinkin distilled vodka

'Til I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real

Pillow-top him like a toupee

Mix the water, with the soda

Turn the pot up make a souflee

All of y'all can get it like group-ays in your 2-way

I'm livin proof that crime do pay

Say hooray to the bad guy, and all the broads

puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game

Puttin 'caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train

All in the name of love

Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came

over the house to take back, everything that they claimed

Or even the worst pain is the distress

Learnin you're the mistress only after that love gets slain

And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust

Now it gets tough to ever love a-gain

But the allure of the game, keeps callin your name

To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain

To all the Christies in every cities and Tiffany Lanes

We all hustlers, in love with the same thang



[Chorus]



[Verse Three]

I never felt more alive than ridin shotgun

In Cline's green 5 until the cops pulled guns

And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need

what the game did to my pulse, with no results

And you can treat your nose and still won't come close

The game is a lightbulb with eleventy-million volts

And I'm just a mark, addicted to the floss

And doors lift from the floor and the tops come off

By any means necessary, whatever the cost

Even if it means lives is lost..

And I can't explain why, I just love to get high

Drink life, smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice

I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times

I may not even be alive

How mean James Dean couldn't escape the allure

Dyin young, leavin a good lookin corpse

Of course



[Chorus]



Once again it's the life

I said it's the life

Once again it's the life - oh no!

(I don't why I) why I (get so high on)

get so (get so high on) uh-huh

(get so high - high off the life!)

Hahahahahahaha - woo!"

[Faith Evans] + (Jay-Z)

Last night I had a dream

Thoughts was racin through my head (it was all a dream)

Felt so real to me

This is what was said..



[Jay-Z]

Had a dream I said, bout who he said?

Bout B.I.G. I said, that's big he said

Dig he said, proceed he said

Indeed I said, so - breathe I did

Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothin

He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this

What I believe to be a yes I re-peated what was said

It came to me like a .. well as even I said

""You feel playboy,"" was the greeting he said

First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?

""More money, more problems, better believe it,"" he said

""Careful what you wish for you might receive it,"" he said

I see I said, jealousy I said

Got the whole industry mad at me I said

Then B.I. said, ""Hov' remind yourself

nobody built like you, you designed yourself""

I agree I said, my one of a kind self

Get stoned every day like Jesus did

What he said, I said, has been said before

""Just keep doin your thing,"" he said, say no more



[Faith Evans]

Was it all a dream - tell me

Was it all a dream, was it a dream

Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

I gotta know {*""It was all a dream""*}

Was it all a dream - was it a dream

Was it all a dream, a dream

Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam



[Notorious B.I.G.]

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine

Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine

Hangin pictures on my wall

Every Saturday, ""Rap Attack,"" Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 

I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped

Smokin weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock 

Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack

with the hat to match 

Remember Rappin' Duke? ""Duh-ha, duh-ha""

You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far

Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight

Time to get paid, blow up like the {**""World Trade""**}

Born sinner, the opposite of a winner

Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner

Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri

Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky

I'm blowin up like you thought I would

Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good

Uhh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga



[Faith Evans]

Was it all a dream - tell me

Was it all a dream, was it a dream

Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

I gotta know {*""It was all a dream""*}

Was it all a dream - was it a dream

Was it all a dream, a dream

Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

Welcome to the.. Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some

Uhh



Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable

Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)

Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable

Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)



[Jay-Z]

Follow the flow, look

They say a midget standin on the giant's shoulder can see much

further than the giant.. (the giant..)

So I got the WHOLE rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see

further than I am.. (than I am..)

And I have been tryin to be patient with they preoccupation

with David and Goliath.. (Goliath..)

But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course

and I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)

But bein tyrant, comin through your environment

Iron mask, nigga iron gas, nigga I am back

With ""The Team,"" no I in that

R.O.C., y'all not eyein that

Y'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone

""The Dynasty,"" no not Ming but Shawn's

Dame careems, nigga it's the gangsta team

Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene

The other reason, we got a gang of green

If there's better at gettin cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga



WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Jeah, jeah



[Chorus]

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable

Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)

Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable

Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)



Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable..



[Jay-Z]

Jeah, look

I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life

Look behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice

Back to the future and gotta slow up for the present

I'm fast, niggaz can't get past my past

How they propose to deal with my perfect present?

When I unwrap ""The Gift & the Curse"" in one session

Ain't no livin person can test him

Only two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him

Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it

But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it

If you did it I done it before, you get I had it

Got mad at it and don't want it no more

And that goes for everything from flippin that raw

Flippin whores, flippin vocal chords, don't get it twisted

Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice

Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)



[Chorus]



[Jay-Z]

Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone

The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back

You cats overfelt yourself

You couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel

In my absence cats get, absent-minded

Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em

why I'm in the position that I am

changin the game, my game could nail Madonna

Well after I'm gone, they'll honor

history in the makin, Pistol Pete

leave competition shakin without missin the beat

Chasin the hi-hat all over the track

The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!

And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget

The watch face so blue like it's holdin it's breath

Can't see me skill for skill or check for check

It's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck

Live and correct I will bring it to your set

I got now, I don't care who got next

Rapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart

Your flow all y'all usin is mine, you're all useless

You ain't a factor, who are you foolin?

You all are faggots, you takin it backwards (takin it backwards)

I'm tryin to progress with this rap shit

Nigga, nigga your whole career is a accident

Who was gassin 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride

Through the sky I

Use to play the hall up fifth floor me and my boys we

All poor getting high I

seen the worst of the worst I deserve every blessing

I received I'm from the dirt

I planted my seed on unfertile land Myrtle Park

Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand and

Still I grew some how I knew the sun will shine through

And touch my soul take hold of my hand

Look man a tree grows in Brooklyn

Talking:( To old Nell, Sigel street I ain't forget you)



Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck

Nosey neighbors and haters keep their face on stuck

Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up

Behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck

Girls fighting over Rollie young boys hype things up

Niggas fighting over Cold young boys light things up

All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up

Remember Lil' Eddie man how he light mean up

Then they wonder why we light green up

Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't

I lean up ain't the L or the refer that steam up

It's my head stress to the point I get a fever

Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids

That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em

For the rest of their life fucking wings fried

Vegetable rice(gotta be kidding)

No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night

Our kids eating lunch at night

In their beds all bunched in tight

No less than three or four(you know how it go)

Two by the foot two by the headboard

Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)

Thats how I feel for them

And we gotta grip the shorties on the block

All they do is smoke weed and drink forties

Cop their quarties

Enough to get the latest ROC, newest glock, and old Jordies



[Chorus]

Some how some way

We gonna make it up out the hood someday

Some how some way

We gonna make it up out this life

Some how some way

We gonna make it up out the hood one day

Some way we gonna make it up out this life



[Scarface]

Right here another lil' story bout this click I claimed

Another chapter based on how I get that game

Hanging round my neighborhood and bang my street

Sit and watch the passer-bys play my sweep

South-side sunny side

Blocks I run South Vegas, South Paul

Nigga all got guns

Over here we got this poor (?) get that there

We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that there

Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps

Working inside a slump house starving to death

Serving these nigga flippers, quarter-ounces and

Zippers agents snapping your picture neighbors

Plotting to get ya

Situations is critic I was out here to get it

Living it like a savage cause nigga I gotta have it

And holding back all the mothers for a minute

Pumping hard dog

Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all dog

Love being willied and your creek gonna rise

I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise

(Some how some way)

(Some how some way)

I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out the hood some day

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out this life

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out the hood some day

Some way we gotta make it up out this life

What I believe to be a yes I re-peated what was said

It came to me like a .. well as even I said

""You feel playboy,"" was the greeting he said

First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?

""More money, more problems, better believe it,"" he said

""Careful what you wish for you might receive it,"" he said

I see I said, jealousy I said

Got the whole industry mad at me I said

Then B.I. said, ""Hov' remind yourself

nobody built like you, you designed yourself""

I agree I said, my one of a kind self

Get stoned every day like Jesus did

What he said, I said, has been said before

""Just keep doin your thing,"" he said, say no more

Was it all a dream - tell me

Was it all a dream, a dream

Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam



[Notorious B.I.G.]

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine

Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine

Hangin pictures on my wall

Every Saturday, ""Rap Attack,"" Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 

I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped

Smokin weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock 

Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack

with the hat to match 

Remember Rappin' Duke? ""Duh-ha, duh-ha""

You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far

Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight

Time to get paid, blow up like the {**""World Trade""**}

Born sinner, the opposite of a winner

Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner

Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri

Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky

I'm blowin up like you thought I would

Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good

Uhh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga



[Faith Evans]

Was it all a dream - tell me

Was it all a dream, was it a dream

Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

Welcome to the.. Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some

Uhh



Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable

Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)

Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable

Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)



[Jay-Z]

Follow the flow, look

They say a midget standin on the giant's shoulder can see much

further than the giant.. (the giant..)

So I got the WHOLE rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see

further than I am.. (than I am..)

And I have been tryin to be patient with they preoccupation

with David and Goliath.. (Goliath..)

But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course

and I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)

But bein tyrant, comin through your environment

Iron mask, nigga iron gas, nigga I am back

With ""The Team,"" no I in that

R.O.C., y'all not eyein that

Y'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone

""The Dynasty,"" no not Ming but Shawn's

Dame careems, nigga it's the gangsta team

Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene

The other reason, we got a gang of green

If there's better at gettin cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga



WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Jeah, jeah



[Chorus]

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable

Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)

Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable

Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)



Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable..



[Jay-Z]

Jeah, look

I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life

Look behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice

Back to the future and gotta slow up for the present

I'm fast, niggaz can't get past my past

How they propose to deal with my perfect present?

When I unwrap ""The Gift & the Curse"" in one session

Ain't no livin person can test him

Only two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him

Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it

But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it

If you did it I done it before, you get I had it

Got mad at it and don't want it no more

And that goes for everything from flippin that raw

Flippin whores, flippin vocal chords, don't get it twisted

Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice

Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)



[Chorus]



[Jay-Z]

Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone

The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back

You cats overfelt yourself

You couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel

In my absence cats get, absent-minded

Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em

why I'm in the position that I am

changin the game, my game could nail Madonna

Well after I'm gone, they'll honor

history in the makin, Pistol Pete

leave competition shakin without missin the beat

Chasin the hi-hat all over the track

The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!

And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget

The watch face so blue like it's holdin it's breath

Can't see me skill for skill or check for check

It's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck

Live and correct I will bring it to your set

I got now, I don't care who got next

Rapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart

Your flow all y'all usin is mine, you're all useless

You ain't a factor, who are you foolin?

You all are faggots, you takin it backwards (takin it backwards)

I'm tryin to progress with this rap shit

Nigga, nigga your whole career is a accident

Who was gassin 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

(Please believe that) Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some how some way

We gotta make it up out this life

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out this life

Some way we gotta make it up out this life



[Jay-Z]

Weather we dribble out this motherfucker

Rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker

Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker

Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker

Some day the cops will kill a motherfucker

I don't always want to be this drug dealing

Motherfucker damn

Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride

Through the sky I

Use to play the hall up fifth floor me and my boys we

All poor getting high I

seen the worst of the worst I deserve every blessing

I received I'm from the dirt

I planted my seed on unfertile land Myrtle Park

Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand and

Still I grew some how I knew the sun will shine through

And touch my soul take hold of my hand

Look man a tree grows in Brooklyn



[Chorus]

Some how some way

I gotta make it up out the hood someday

Some how some way

I gotta make it up out this life

Some way I gotta make it up out this hood someday



[Beanie Sigel]

Talking:( To old Nell, Sigel street I ain't forget you)



Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck

Nosey neighbors and haters keep their face on stuck

Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up

Behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck

Girls fighting over Rollie young boys hype things up

Niggas fighting over Cold young boys light things up

All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up

Remember Lil' Eddie man how he light mean up

Then they wonder why we light green up

Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't

I lean up ain't the L or the refer that steam up

It's my head stress to the point I get a fever

Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids

That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em

For the rest of their life fucking wings fried

Vegetable rice(gotta be kidding)

No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night

Our kids eating lunch at night

In their beds all bunched in tight

No less than three or four(you know how it go)

Two by the foot two by the headboard

Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)

Thats how I feel for them

And we gotta grip the shorties on the block

All they do is smoke weed and drink forties

Cop their quarties

Enough to get the latest ROC, newest glock, and old Jordies



[Chorus]

Some how some way

We gonna make it up out the hood someday

Some how some way

We gonna make it up out this life

Some how some way

We gonna make it up out the hood one day

Some way we gonna make it up out this life



[Scarface]

Right here another lil' story bout this click I claimed

Another chapter based on how I get that game

Hanging round my neighborhood and bang my street

Sit and watch the passer-bys play my sweep

South-side sunny side

Blocks I run South Vegas, South Paul

Nigga all got guns

Over here we got this poor (?) get that there

We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that there

Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps

Working inside a slump house starving to death

Serving these nigga flippers, quarter-ounces and

Zippers agents snapping your picture neighbors

Plotting to get ya

Situations is critic I was out here to get it

Living it like a savage cause nigga I gotta have it

And holding back all the mothers for a minute

Pumping hard dog

Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all dog

Love being willied and your creek gonna rise

I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise

(Some how some way)

(Some how some way)

I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise



[Chorus]

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out the hood some day

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out this life

Some how some way

We gotta make it up out the hood some day

Some way we gotta make it up out this life

Jay-Z this, Jay-Z that
Jay-Z that, Jay-Z this (Jay-Z won't give me no money)
Get off Jay-Z dick
What y'all niggas get front page articles, y'all mention Jay-Z name

(This thing on?) Jay-Z, Jay-Z, in Jay-Z news

I understand what y'all trying to do

I brought the flutes this time, though

I unleashed the flutes on them, guru

Gimme some more music in the headphone

Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening

Let's do this thing (let's do it right this time)

C'mon



H, O V A

I got my mojo back baby, oh behave

Naw, naw, don't be afraid

Y'all and your articles, hard to spit at Jay

Y'all from afar threw thoughts my way

What you thought, I would naught have nothing to say? Nope!

Y'all fell into the booby trap

I set the trap just to see dude react, and now

And now you'se can't leave

You opened the door god, I'm at you annually

And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez

I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is

But you can't give cred to anything dude says

Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head

(Shortyyyy!) It's time to wake up the dead

You sound a little naive in them articles that I read



[Hook] (x2)

H, O V A

The Blueprint 2 baby, on the way

H, O V A

I got my mojo back baby, oh behave



[Jay-Z]

Can't y'all, see that he's fake, the rap version of TD jakes

Prophesizing on your CDs and tapes

Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes

And this is with whom you want to place your faith?

I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine

When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line

Donating proceeds off every ticket sold

When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?

Ain't I supposed to be absorbed myself?

Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help

They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude

To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects

These dudes is all politics, depositing checks

they put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip

And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype

Cause the nigga wear a coofie, it don't mean that he bright

Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice

It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write

Is it ""Oochie Wally Wally"" or is it ""One Mic""?

Is it ""Black Girl Lost"" or shorty owe you for ice?

I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit

Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat

But I will not lose, for even in defeat

There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens it up for me

When the grass is cut, the snakes will show

I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though

Saving me the hassle of speaking to half of these assholes

And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa

I'm back before you had a chance to miss me

My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history

Who you know flow vicious as me?

Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov

I get the spoils cause the victor is me (me, nigga)

You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be

The street dreamin, all y'all niggas living through me

I gave you life when niggas was forgetting you emcee

I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me

You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee

I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen God you a flea

And the little homey Jungle is a garden to me

What's the problem B? You not as hard as me

Nigga hard as we, nigga R O C, nigga

That's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga

I won't rest till you on one knee

You want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga

Until you on one knee, you want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga

Nobody can read you dudes like we do

Don't let 'em gas you like Jigga is ass and won't clap you

Trust me on this one - I'll detach you

Mind from spirit, body from soul

They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole

No, you're not on my level get your brakes tweaked

Nigga; you a - LAAAAAAAME!

Youse the fag model for Karl Kani/Esco ads

Went from, Nasty Nas to Esco's trash

Had a spark when you started but now you're just garbage

Fell from top ten to not mentioned at all

to your bodyguard's ""Oochie Wally"" verse better than yours

Matter fact you had the worst flow on the whole fuckin song

but I know - the sun don't shine, then son don't shine

That's why your - LAAAAAAAME! - career come to a end

There's only so long fake thugs can pretend

Nigga; you ain't live it you witnessed it from your folks pad

You scribbled in your notepad and created your life

I showed you your first tec on tour with Large Professor

(Me, that's who!) Then I heard your album bout your tec on the dresser

So yeah I sampled your voice, you was usin it wrong

You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song

And you ain't get a coin nigga you was gettin fucked and

I know who I paid God, Serchlite Publishing

Use your - BRAAAAAAAIN! You said you been in this ten

I've been in it five - smarten up Nas

Four albums in ten years nigga? I can divide

That's one every let's say two, two of them shits was due

One was - NAHHH, the other was ""Illmatic""

That's a one hot album every ten year average

And that's so - LAAAAAAAME! Nigga switch up your flow

Your shit is garbage, but you try and kick knowledge?

(Get the fuck outta here) You niggaz gon' learn to respect the king

Don't be the next contestant on that Summer Jam screen

Because you know who (who) did you know what (what)

with you know who (yeah) but just keep that between me and you for now

A wise man told me don't argue with fools

Cause people from a distance can't tell who is who

So stop with that childish shit, nigga I'm grown

Please leave it alone - don't throw rocks at the throne

Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you

I don't know why your advisors ain't forewarn you

Please, not Jay, he's, not for play

I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin and gimmicks

I will end it, all that yappin be finished

You are not deep, you made your bed now sleep

Don't make me expose you to them folks that don't know you

Nigga I know you well, all the stolen jew-els

Twinkletoes you breakin my heart

You can't fuck with me - go play somewhere, I'm busy

And all you other cats throwin shots at Jigga

Even though a nigga got move like a crook move

We was together on the block since free lunch

We shoulda been together havin 4 Seasons brunch

We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather

So now we travel first class to change the forecast

Never in bunches, just me and you

I loved your point of view cause you held no punches

Still I left you for months on end

It's been months since I checked back in

Well somewhere in a small town, somewhere lockin a mall down

Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down

I can understand why you want a divorce now

Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it

Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with

You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6

We was so happy poor but when we got rich

That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped

Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit

Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it

It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick

I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me

Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me

Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy

And then they got fussy and they don't remember that

And I don't remember you..

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone

Word back home is that you had a special friend

So what was oh so special then?

You have given away without gettin at me

That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?

How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?

I know the way a nigga livin was whack

But you don't get a nigga back like that!

Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that

You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that

You don't throw away what we had, just like that

I was just fuckin them girls, I was gon' get right back

They say you can't turn a bad girl good

But once a good girl's goin bad, she's gone forever..

And more forever

Shit I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever

The theme song to +The Sopranos+

plays in the key of life on my, mental piano

Got a strange way of seein life like

I'm Stevie Wonder with, beads under the doo-rag

Intuition is there even when my vision's impaired, yeah

Knowin I can go, just switchin a spare

On the highway of life, nigga it's sharp in my sight

Oh! Keen senses ever since I was a, teen on the benches

everytime somebody like Enus was mentioned

I would turn green, me, bein in the trenches

Him, livin adventureous not worryin about expenditures

I'm bravin temperatures below zero, no hero

No father figure, you gotta pardon a nigga

But I'm starvin my niggaz, and the weight loss in my figure

is startin to darken my heart, bout to get to my liver

Watch it my niggaz, I'm tryin to be calm but I'm gon' get richer

through any means, with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture

Never read the Qu'ran or Islamic scriptures

Only psalms I read was on the arms of my niggaz

Tattooed so I carry on like I'm non-religious

Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures

Niggaz, say it's the dawn/Don but I'm superstitious

Shit is as dark as it's been, nothin is goin as you predicted

I move with biscuits, stop the harder niggaz actin too suspicious

This is, food for thought, you do the dishes"

[Jay-Z]
Geah.. whassup?
Where's all my street niggaz, project niggaz
Real niggaz, worldwide

Let's reflect.. e'rybody got a story

We all ghetto B - here's mine 

Geah



See I was -- born in sewage, born to make bomb music

Flow tight like I was born Jewish

Used the streets as a conduit - I kept arms 

38 longs inside my mom's Buick

At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news

Iron cuffs - arms through it; or stuffed with embalmin fluid

Shit, I'm goin through it - mom dukes too

Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it

My life is gettin too wild

I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it

Bout to lose it; voices screamin ""Don't do it!""

It's like '93, '94, bout the year 

that Big and Mag dropped; and ""Illmatic"" rocked 

outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked

Everybody doin 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block

like ""Damn; I'ma be a failure""

Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug - paraphenalia

Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us

Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts

Tryin figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin

So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!

It gets worse, baby momma water burst

Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on

Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb

Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be -- soon



[Chorus: Jay-Z]

This can't be life, this can't be love

This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

This can't be life, this can't be love

This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us



[Beanie Sigel]

Chill dog

Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother

Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother

Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another

I'm thinkin damn; how my older sister gon' make me tougher

When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real

I'm tired of tryin to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills

Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real

Y'all niggaz thinkin what y'all readin in The Source is real

What my life like, you lookin at the source, it's real

What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real

Passin judgment, you niggaz second-guessin Beans

Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Amin

Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an

I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine

Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body

Make 'em feel feel hell on earth before Allah drop thee

I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me

Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me

There's only three things that make Mac not act like Beans

Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin

My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog

Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog

I come back in the afterlife

Like fuck it I done touched hell twice; what's the meanin?



[Chorus]



[Scarface]

Yeah.. uhh..

Now as I walk into the studio, to do this with Jig'

I got a phone call from one of my nigs

Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids

And when I heard that I just broke into tears

And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is

But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib

So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news

Now we both depressed, countin our blessings cause Brad's two

Prayin for young souls to laugh atlife through the stars

Lovin your kids just like you was ours

And I'm hurtin for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours

I just know that heaven'll open these doors

And ain't no bright side to losin lifel; but you can view it like this 

God's got open hands homey, he in the midst.. of good company

Who loves all and hates not one

And one day you gon' be wit your son

I could've rapped about my hard times on this song

But heaven knows I woulda been wrong

I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love 

It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us

This can't be life



[Chorus]

Uh huh
Is y'all ready?
Is y'all ready??

HOOK 2X:

Holla!

If you real and you know you a G

Holla!

Deep in these streets when you pumpin that D

Holla!

Be in your hood screamin fuck police

Holla!

You keep a gun and you bust for beef



[Verse 1]

Niggas say I'm focused now, they know that's my style

But dogg, I'm on the block with that coke and a smile

I still got the crack heads I.D.

And they know, I collect for the first and fifteenth

I still take cabs to that capsule spot

For them 31 illusions and them purple tops

And the game aint change, niggas is taught different

I'm raised off one rule, never get caught slippin

That's why I eat, sleep, shit with my gat

Bag up, take a piss, fuck a bitch with my gat

And I done sold it all from crack to marijuana

You can't deny it, I'm in hoods like Tom Warner

Beat cop, take away, I keep my shit

They don't know I deliver off the beeps I get

And you snitch ass niggas wanna peep my shit

But I'ma show you how deep into these streets I get



HOOK



[Verse 2]

See what this game made, and *of age I came*

And you up and coming rappers know you young to this game

*I went from Marcy to Hollywood, I'm back again*

I don't need no applaud, to clap again

Let alone, no award, from rap to win

Talk drama, get yourself wrapped up in

Severe head trauma, get beat with the nine lime-a

Cut your hand off if you fuckin with my product

That slayed shit, I'm on the grave shift

We all know fucked up money don't pay rent

You short with my ones, you short one thumb

You can't, come up short where the fuck I'm from

We got, dues to pay, new tools to spray

Who's to say, Bleek won't make news today

You know the ooze'll spray if you refuse to pay

And I move the yae nigga day by day

What's the problem shorty?

Yeah whattup man

I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man

I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me



[Beanie Sigel]

Alright; hold on - Hova, line one



[Jay-Z]

Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it

You find a dude in town, you send him a short message

Say, ""Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around

but I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown

I get that butter all night

cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike

They keep buyin hard white

And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price

FYI, I never been robbed in my life""

Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and

let her introduce you 'round town like her man

Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent

then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up

Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit

Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them

Still there Brooklyn?



[Shorty]

Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one



[Jay-Z]

Make out a check for eight hundred dollars

Jigga Man, holla {*click*, *dial tone*}



[Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy

[Beans] Yeah I feel that

[Chris] I know you well connected dog

Let me holla at somebody real

[Beans] Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on

Bleek, line two



[Memphis Bleek]

Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word

I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd

You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first

If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first

You new in town, no red and blue in town, there's gangs

Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change

The strong move quiet, the weak start riots

We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired

With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish

and other niggaz who gettin it - DEAD IT

Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse

He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved

Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it

Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic

900-Hustler, you pass it around

Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out

{*click*, *classical type music plays*}

[MDKHN] I know this nigga ain't just put.. put me on hold man

This bullshit-ass elevator music

[Beans] Free, pick up line five



[Freeway]

First things first, watch what you say out your mouth

when you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers

Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch

when you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers

Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out

if a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya

Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state

Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (hoe!)

Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)

You stoppin dough when we clutchin the gats?

I know you heard ""Friend or Foe,"" this ain't different from that

Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like

Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo

until you up stay away from them dykes and whores

Three smuts, two straights and a dyke

can pause one-three rumbles two streaks and a pipe for sure

And if it's tight, then he might come back for more

Nine and four, everyday back and forth

Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler

Pass the number til you're stackin balls

Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more

I take cash or write the check out to F-R

two E's, that'll be two G's

And forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga

My whole crew up in this muh'fucker

We spray corners, stand there like you got a cape on ya, fine

You'll be wearing a black suit a long time

The priest is like, ""God's got him

He never did nuttin to nobody but them boys shot him""

Brandish iron, outlandish buyin

Bentley Coupes, not braggin just simply the truth

We all from the ghetto, only difference, we go back

Back up in D&D on this Primo track, listen

""You can love me or hate me.."" ""..Jay-Z""

""Roc-a-Fella lock the whole block down""



[Jay-Z]

Wednesday's I'm up in Shine, Cheetah's Monday night

So I'm cruisin in the car with this boozy broad

She said, ""Jigga-Man you rich, take the doo-rag off""

Hit a U-turn; ma I'm droppin you back off

Front of the club, ""Jigga why you do that for?""

Thug nigga til the end, tell a friend bitch

Won't change for no paper plus I been rich

Eighty-eight been hustlin, linen been crushin em

Women been fuckin them HUH?

You see I live for the love of the street

Rap to the ruggedest beats

Hall closet cluttered with heat

We tote guns to the Grammy's, pop bottles on the White House lawn

Guess I'm just the same old Shawn



Chorus



[Jay-Z]

I'm from the M-to-the-A-baby-R-C-Y

So it's hard for me to let the larceny die

Niggaz see me in the streets with no bodyguards

just two big guns that'll body your squad

Could niggaz be scheamin on me? Probably are

Think Jigga's a joke nigga? Hardy har

I spit Brook-Brook-Brooklyn every time I bust

Radio's gotta play me though I cuss too much

Magazine said I'm shallow, I never learned to swim

Still they put me on they cover cause I earn for them

Soon as I sell too much, watch them turn on him

cause that seem to be the shit that'll earn for them

I spit that murder-murder-murderous everytime a verbalist

iller than Verbal Kint is or O-Dog in ""Menace""

I'm ill, start to finish, I rip apart contenders

I'm hot.. hehehehe..

{*Sound of a camera taking a picture*}
[Jay]Millenium flow
[MTV]Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse

[Jay]This is {bullshit} y'all

[MTV]in New York City for the first day in the trial of 

[Jay]I'm gone {*car speeds off*}

[MTV]the State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z

[Jay]Uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh

[MTV]Whatever the verdict in this trial may be

the effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide



[Jay-Z]

Aiyyo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice

or witness to me killin the track

Testify 'til me spillin the smack

Now they got me for traffickin, racketeerin, audio crack

{Hook:}They call me Dope Man, Dope Man

I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man

Ghetto spokes-man

A broke man, approachin the bench with intent

to bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man

Evidence stemmin from ninety-six

They say the world ain't recovered from his fix

While they was usin cut I was on some other shit

Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it

Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised

Listenin to testimony about my foul ways

Exhibit A: ""Reasonable Doubt""

They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out



[MTV]You can feel the tension building here

as an unprecedented number of people have turned out

for what may be the ""Trial of the Century""

{Hook}



[Jay-Z]

How come, you label your brand of dope

""Volume 1"" and spread it through the slums?

Fed it to the young with total disregard

Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge

And how could you, turn right around

and release a lethal dosage called ""Volume 2""

And is true you operate the criminal enterprise

known as Roc-a-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?

And do you deny you're responsible for the demise

of record execs, and do you object?

Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects

Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan

And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen

Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons

And we ain't gon' talk about Murder, Inc.

That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link



[MTV]The State is seeking the maximum penalty

and with the overwhelming amount of evidence

the D.A.'s presented, things aren't looking good

{Hook}

[MTV]Despite the grim outlook at this point

the rapper has been known to emerge triumphant

in the face of adversity

{Hook}

[MTV]Jay-Z is taking the stand



[Jay-Z]

Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air

Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear

A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance

Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands

But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up

Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up

Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks

Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors

Keep us spiralin, goin backwards

At age nine, saw my first hate crime

Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line

Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine

Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined

Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine

Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine

The soul of Mumia in this modern day time



[MTV]While the jury is inside deliberating

outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation

{Hook}

[MTV]Well the verdict has just been announced: NOT GUILTY!

It is complete pandemonium out here! {Hook; Serena keeps speaking}

People are cheering and hugging - there he is

Jay-Z is exiting the courtroom right now

There is a swarm of cameras surrounding him {*pop bulbs flashing*}

and people are just rushing up to him

Let's try and make our way over there, Jay-Z! Jay-Z!

{*sounds of cameras keep flashing*, *music fades*}"

Yo, yo

This is for my niggaz down in Houston on candy paint

All my niggaz in the Dirty South, Miami mayne

All my niggaz in the A-T-L throwin dem bones

All them thugs that send slugs through your clothes; holla at me

It's for the black culture, Spanish chicks with the sweet chocha

Spanish cats with the ki's of cocoa

All the haters eat a dick they wanna see you brok-er

I hope the heat stroke ya, the misery is over

All my deep smokers, I hope the leaf choke ya

Hope you'll never be sober I'ma toast to myself

I hope the Crist' get me, spiralin into a tizzy

So pissy, swervin on the road dizzy

May God protect my soul, angels walk with me

First do the flow sickly, niggaz is so shifty

The fo'-fo' is like a force field, you won't get me

I brought some folk with me, Brooklyn is loc'n with me

What the fuck?



Chorus: Juvenile (repeat 2X)



You know, we ride

All day, all night

Pop Crist, shoot dice

Fuck hoes, for life



[Jay-Z]

This is for my chicks that get dough for takin off they clothes

All them money makin honeys that slide down the poles

All my educated chicks who grade is 4.0

All the baby mamas across the globe; aiyyo

I like my women friends feminine

I like my hoes on ""X"" like Eminem.. shit!

I like em bow-legged, never coke-headed

With a dough fetish - the drive to go get it

I like they toes proper, I like they clothes Prada

I like they shoes Gucci, I like new coochie

I fucked a few groupies, in a few hoopties

I got em iceberg shit they thought I knew Snoopy

I cop them Roc-a-Wear, my mamis dedicated

They never tell me no, the most they said is ""not here""

I got they ears studded, both wrists baguetted

I got a main chick, a mistress, and a young bitch

Forget it I'm the don



Chorus



[Jay-Z]

Wha-What?

This is for my dice shooters, cats doin life

By the time I get this kite to ya, I hope you doin alright

Who got em platinum up? Who got the chicks in the truck?

Too much to sit comfortably, they lappin up

Who shit is big pimpin? See the flow different

I drop heavy then I let the four-fifth flip em

I keep rappers talkin to kids, Jigga ""Sixth Sense-d"" em

Don't mention my name and lames in the same sentence

You see I'm so thorough, take on your whole borough

Be so careful I hear the whistle from the fo'-fo' barrel

Keep the flow Hovah; icy neck, cold shoulder

Who click is closest to La Costra Nostra?

It's ""The Roc""

[Bun B]

Nigga it's the - big Southern rap impresario

Comin straight up out the black bar-rio

Makes a mill' up off a sorry hoe

Then sit back and peep my sce-nawr-e-oh

Oops, my bad, that's my scenario

No I can't fuck a scary hoe

Now every time, every place, everywhere we go

Hoes start pointin - they say, ""There he go!""

Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo' heat than a little bit

We don't pull it out over little shit

And if you catch a lick when I spit, then it won't be a little hit

Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo' vocab

Don't be surprised if yo' hoe stab out with me

and you see us comin down on yo' slab

Livin ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it

But nigga if you hatin I

then you wait while I get yo' bitch butt-naked, just break it

You gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on

Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin to the track 

Timbaland let me spit my pro's on

Pump it up in the pro-zone

That's the track that we breakin these hoes on

Ain't the track that we flow's on

But when shit get hot, then the glock start poppin like ozone

We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man

Fo' real it don't get no bigger man

Don't trip, let's flip, gettin throwed on the flip

Gettin blowed with the motherfuckin Jigga Man, fool



Chorus Two: Bun B

We be.. big pimpin down in P.A.T.

[Pimp C]

Uhh.. smokin out, throwin up, keepin lean up in my cup

All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck

Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall

If he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't fuck witch'all

If I wasn't rappin baby, I would still be ridin Mercedes

This is educated thug MU-SIC, niggaz
Life's a battle, mean streets eat you alive
Blocks'll have you, tryin to maintain your course

through the potholes and gravel

Hot holes and what-have-you, tryin to clock dough

Foes tryin to pop shots through you by code

Pigs tryin to grab you and lock up your soul

Through the Hot Apple, nighttime shots crackle

(bucka bucka bucka) Fiends tryin to gaffle you

Not only cokeheads but the Feds in the Mercuray Topaz

after you, up the avenue

Tryin to give you big numbers, you got math to do

Tryin to make you miss summer, shit, that ain't cool

I caught smaller cases tryin to get cap or two

Up against the wall, tryin to pass through

Ghost-like, hear the cries from the tortured souls

Most nights, I hold my toast tight, and it goes like

Cocktails thrown in your living room, KA-BOOM

I'm so confrontational;

they shoulda never let me go on probation yo

I'm a hustler; except that..

no correctional facilities can correct that

I took a step back, I viewed myself, seen where my head was at

It's where that dough is homey, gotta get that

Gotta get away, some try but head back

Uhh, street smart niggaz got left back

Some died, they left stacks

Me, I ball right, and on top of that I'm dog nice

I held tears back, I gathered myself and stared back

I'm from where you don't crack, the weak don't live

You gotta bounce back homey, the streets don't give

I take and rape villages, who gon' stop him?

Not Rudy Guiliani, not Hillary Rodham

Still I still pop him

Shit I grassy knoll and hilltop him, it's all political now

I think big when I spit at you now

Between my dog and the figures, the four gonna get'cha

Between life and death, they killed my spirit

So what little life I got left, y'all can expect me to ball

I ? myself, teacher said I was a lost cause

cause I used to roam them halls

Still I spit knowledge, dropped out of high school, skipped college

Who woulda thought I'd make it ""Big"" like Ms. Wallace?

1 - I'd risk everything

For one kiss, everything

Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)

Anything for you



I'd do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trustin' that

Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours

Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa

Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall

My brother from anotha pop, minus one shot

We Neno and G-Money man, we all we got

From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops

And us gettin mad, throwin' rocks off the roof

Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress

But look at us now man, we're young execs

My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Tah

My nigga Ja, my nigga Gotti

We embody all that's right with the world

No matter how pretty she is, you never likin' my girl

That's how we run, when you ain't around

I'll spank ya son, keep him in line

If you should die, I'll keep him like mine

God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga



Repeat 1

Repeat 1



I know mama, your little baby

But these streets raised me crazy

Product of my environment, nothing can save me

Thanks for letting me bloom for your wisdom for your womb

For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed

For the most important lesson in life was when you said

""Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them""

Thanks for the days you kept me breathing when my asthma was bad

And my chest was weezin', thanks for the look of love

Just as I was leavin'

On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back

That left you grieving'

Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad

As the man, I apologize for my dad

When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do

That wasn't the life meant for you

You're a queen, you deserve the cream

Everything that gleamed, everything that shines

Everything that's mine



Repeat 1

Repeat 1



Check it out, uh, uh

Dear nephews, I'm writing' this with no pen or a pad

And I'm signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad

Don't look back if you fall and you're feeling bad

I'm right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab

If it comes a time when you ain't feelin' your real dad

Put my face on his body don't wait for nobody

Don't follow no nigga, that's hoe shit man

Stand on your own two, do your shit man

The world is yours

Some girls are nice some girls are whores

Don't listen to your crew

Do what works for you

Standin' back from situations gives you the perfect view

You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass

Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said

Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed,

You know my number when it's code red if you're wrong my nigga

You're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

Greyhound bitch, stay down bitch

Bout to set up shop with Jay, round this bitch

Half a brick of yea, bout to lay down this bitch

(til November?) Nah, I'm here to like slay down this bitch

What you think? I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch

Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch

I'm tryin to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch

Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six

Roll the windows down and, weight round this bitch

But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch

Gotta talk to the natives, let em know I'm here 

for all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters

I got jobs for ya, drop stars for ya

More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya

Money providentials hope that's not a problem for ya

If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (That's right!)



Chorus: Foxy, Jay-Z



[F]Gotta get that paper dog

[J]Gotta get that paper dog

[J]When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?



[Jay-Z]

I got my two guns, I came to scoop ones

A down ass bitch and she down to click

Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with

And my plan is, not to leave this town til I'm rich

Gotta find a nigga sellin all them ounces and shit

Tell them get down with the click or get found in a ditch

See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit

Not to hit em, just to let em know the sound of shit

Return later that evening in the club with Fox

And I got the snub nosed for those that love to box

I'm in search of them young niggaz that hug the block

all day, til it's like gray outside

Shoot dice talkin shit all day outside

And even when it's hot, they outside

Let em know, how it's gon' go, Bonnie n Clyde

And aiyyo, you will want me on your side



Chorus



[Jay-Z]

Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best

I ain't got it to give but I got it to test

And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest

is your time, I gotta move this in a, week or less

For the next couple of days I brought her all I posess

The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS

Twin to drive in the passenger with a TV rest

For my top draft picks I cop the new GS

Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team

Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed em the cream

Picked em up in the afternoons and told em some things

You know the regular shit you do when you moldin them teens

Yo, never lay your head where you holdin them things

From family, to your business, nothing goes in between

Never feared no man, put four in his Beem

Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?

Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted

Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo

Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass

with no mask, look at the camera like what?

Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed

To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy

Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal

If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids

I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola ?bid?

And walk the streets up in ? ? like I don't fuckin care

If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs

Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children

when I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building

Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores

Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores

I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way

Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray

As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall

Takin shots of Louie til I fall

Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove

and kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move

My team, you would think was on Thorazine

How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing



[Beanie Sigel]

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now

Pick out a quiet town and tie it down

Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now

Beanie Mac I supply it now

My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats

Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps

Bag enough coke to last a few weeks

In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats

You really wanna test my name? And test my game?

Until you have me, test my aim?

Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles

Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule

Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin

Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin

Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin

Cop off the lot never see me at the auction

Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin

Out on the strip, until I reach the margin

Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct

Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend

Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans



[Jadakiss]

Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box

Come down on appeal then I'm killin your pops

You feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX

If this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot

You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family

Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami

Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper

Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper

I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag

you gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it

Lot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce

Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce

They got me where I can't be without my large gat

Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat

Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline

Doin the speed limit or pushin red lines

Six months in the county or fed time

I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime

Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga

ever had beef with, son is a bastard

Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X.

Ruffryder you heard? We got the game mastered



I told you the pain was comin

You wouldn't listen

You tried to play me like a joke?

Now who got the last laugh?

Now take these bullets with you to hell



[Sauce Money]

You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit

So many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick

Picture me fallin off, I'm camera shy

Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die

What's the difference? Either way I'm stunnin your crew

I fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin to lose

Somethin to prove? Spit it, we can have a sprayoff

I lay off wet niggaz and kill em on my day off

Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off

Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off

Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews

Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews

Flow hot like a heatwave bitch

Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with

I'm a meal stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin

for you Phil Jackson niggaz on that Bull



[Styles]

I don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are

I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car

I don't care about your block and whoever you shot

I don't care about your album and whenever it drop

I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked

I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash

Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz

Shootin backwards, just for practice

Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket

Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you

Tell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you

I tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock

My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock

I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven

You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me

I ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella

Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella



[Jay-Z]

I know pop you can't stand us cause you cock them hammers

Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma

Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta

Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna

Whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners

Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon

Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed

Get brained in the four dot six Range

Shit main, switch lanes

every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine

Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain

Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that

You don't wanna owe that man

He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak man

Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more

I just sit on my money til I'm above the law

How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses

We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga

Multiple cars and divas with D-classes

Iceberg sweat with I.B. on the elastic

Shit, beyotch! What the fuck, ya heard me?

Put some more beat on that joint"

In the middle of a war rockin a vest

Who's the illest shorty alive, I confess

I take nine to the chest and I swear to the heaven sky's, I bless

The mics until the day I rest, till they can feel what I feel

I'ma try my best, and if you real like I real

you can provide the rest

Anything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the heart

I'm playing my part, stretched out, just about the best out

Any nigga realer than me, is in a messhall with their chest out

Any rapper with less clout, sell more records than me

We extort them as soon as they record 'em, Bleek

My name is clear, back when a shorty used to braid my hair

On the project stairs, Once I drop to a ceaser Ma I don't need ya

>From the block to the hot two-seaters

On the two Jew-el's I blew more money than Latrell, who else?

They don't know you, think they know you too well, you jell

Like Flubber I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set

Press you're brakes, Feds wanna investigate, Mr. I don't cop nothin

Less than eight, and anything involved with my name

Regardless of the fame

It's hard, I can't even walk through Harlem again,

Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express

My boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress

To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man fuck ya

I suggest let you live right? Negative, I swear

It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife

Close you're casket tight

Take you're last two deep breaths and pass the mic 

To Jay-Z nigga, That's Right!!



Bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball

Uh uh
So So Def
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z]



[Jermaine Dupri]

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes

With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

[Jay-Z]

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings

With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

[Jermaine Dupri]

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam

And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

[Jay-Z]

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang

When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang



[Jermaine Dupri]

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us

Cause all across the ball we burn it up

Drop a little paper, baby toss it up

Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up

See the money ain't a thang



[Jay-Z]

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe

Jigga's style is love, X and O

Save all your accolades, just the dough

My game is wide, all lames aside

Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet

Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye

Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky

Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it

Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young

See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up

Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'

Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up

Multi til I close up, it's all basic

I been spending hundreds since they had small faces

Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas

Me and J.D. got it locked crazy

Where you at haters?



[Chorus]



[Jermaine Dupri]

My cake thick, I live the life

Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night

I make the big moves, do the big things

Take small groups, turn them into big names

The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match

Cats say I'm the shit man

The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew

Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do

Get more burn than a candle

Too hot to hold, too much to handle

In the black C-low, he know if she look

She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'

I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly

In the safest shit you could never buy

Know why? Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing

I don't know about y'all but every night I swing



[Chorus]



[Jay-Z]

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'

And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill

Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin

Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction

Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some

Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey

Platinum, spend your whole life in the day

What's down is a bet, roll the dice



[Jermaine Dupri]

Yeah, yeah, so let's play 

So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel

It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level

Where I'm at, your check, you better double that

And personally your raps is where the trouble at

I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain

In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game

Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain

Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy



[Chorus]



[Jermaine Dupri]

So So Def, Roc-A-Fella, collabo'

You know, all we do is..

What you think? I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch

Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch

I'm tryin to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch

Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six

Roll the windows down and, weight round this bitch

But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch

Gotta talk to the natives, let em know I'm here 

for all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters

I got jobs for ya, drop stars for ya

More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya

Money providentials hope that's not a problem for ya

If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (That's right!)



Chorus: Foxy, Jay-Z



[F]Gotta get that paper dog

[F]Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh!

[J]Gotta get that paper dog

[J]Gotta have that grab that paper dog!

[F]Gotta get that paper dog

[F]Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that

[J]Gotta get that paper dog

[J]When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?



[Jay-Z]

I got my two guns, I came to scoop ones

A down ass bitch and she down to click

Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with

And my plan is, not to leave this town til I'm rich

Gotta find a nigga sellin all them ounces and shit

Tell them get down with the click or get found in a ditch

See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit

Not to hit em, just to let em know the sound of shit

Return later that evening in the club with Fox

And I got the snub nosed for those that love to box

I'm in search of them young niggaz that hug the block

all day, til it's like gray outside

Shoot dice talkin shit all day outside

And even when it's hot, they outside

Let em know, how it's gon' go, Bonnie n Clyde

And aiyyo, you will want me on your side



Chorus



[Jay-Z]

Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best

I ain't got it to give but I got it to test

And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest

is your time, I gotta move this in a, week or less

For the next couple of days I brought her all I posess

The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS

Twin to drive in the passenger with a TV rest

For my top draft picks I cop the new GS

Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team

Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed em the cream

Picked em up in the afternoons and told em some things

You know the regular shit you do when you moldin them teens

Yo, never lay your head where you holdin them things

From family, to your business, nothing goes in between

Never feared no man, put four in his Beem

Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?

[Sheek]
Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted

Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo

Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass

with no mask, look at the camera like what?

Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed

To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy

Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal

If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids

I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola ?bid?

And walk the streets up in ? ? like I don't fuckin care

If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs

Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children

when I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building

Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores

Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores

I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way

Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray

As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall

Takin shots of Louie til I fall

Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove

and kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move

My team, you would think was on Thorazine

How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing



[Beanie Sigel]

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now

Pick out a quiet town and tie it down

Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now

Beanie Mac I supply it now

My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats

Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps

Bag enough coke to last a few weeks

In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats

You really wanna test my name? And test my game?

Until you have me, test my aim?

Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles

Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule

Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin

Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin

Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin

Cop off the lot never see me at the auction

Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin

Out on the strip, until I reach the margin

Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct

Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend

Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans



[Jadakiss]

Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box

Come down on appeal then I'm killin your pops

You feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX

If this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot

You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family

Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami

Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper

Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper

I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag

you gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it

Lot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce

Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce

They got me where I can't be without my large gat

Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat

Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline

Doin the speed limit or pushin red lines

Six months in the county or fed time

I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime

Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga

ever had beef with, son is a bastard

Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X.

Ruffryder you heard? We got the game mastered



I told you the pain was comin

You wouldn't listen

You tried to play me like a joke?

Now who got the last laugh?

Now take these bullets with you to hell



[Sauce Money]

You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit

So many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick

Picture me fallin off, I'm camera shy

Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die

What's the difference? Either way I'm stunnin your crew

I fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin to lose

Somethin to prove? Spit it, we can have a sprayoff

I lay off wet niggaz and kill em on my day off

Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off

Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off

Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews

Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews

Flow hot like a heatwave bitch

Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with

I'm a meal stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin

for you Phil Jackson niggaz on that Bull



[Styles]

I don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are

I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car

I don't care about your block and whoever you shot

I don't care about your album and whenever it drop

I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked

I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash

Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz

Shootin backwards, just for practice

Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket

Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you

Tell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you

I tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock

My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock

I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven

You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me

I ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella

Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella



[Jay-Z]

I know pop you can't stand us cause you cock them hammers

Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma

Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta

Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna

Whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners

Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon

Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed

Get brained in the four dot six Range

Shit main, switch lanes

every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine

Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain

Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that

You don't wanna owe that man

He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak man

Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more

I just sit on my money til I'm above the law

How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses

We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga

Multiple cars and divas with D-classes

Iceberg sweat with I.B. on the elastic

Shit, beyotch! What the fuck, ya heard me?

Put some more beat on that joint"

I need a ho in my life to blow on my dice

So we can make our points twice and skate out a town

I need that glow in my ice, E-Class

Ladies screamin Jigga you know we ease that, flowin out like Jees-ass

Jay-Z and me holdin the mic

so when you like you find MC's so impolite

And me I'm so into nice, got cats on the corner like

Don't me and Jigga be flowin alike? 

Nah, Not in your life ain't nobody copin like

Mr. Jay-Z, shit you're crazy

I'm hot like the six maybe, Deep dish with the great seats

I flow greater than you're navigator

I drop in you're town, block you're data

Pimps all comin through with a hot pair of gators

And a crew with rocks the size of craters

Memphis Bleek:

In the middle of a war rockin a vest

Who's the illest shorty alive, I confess

I take nine to the chest and I swear to the heaven sky's, I bless

The mics until the day I rest, till they can feel what I feel

I'ma try my best, and if you real like I real

you can provide the rest

Anything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the heart

I'm playing my part, stretched out, just about the best out

Any nigga realer than me, is in a messhall with their chest out

Any rapper with less clout, sell more records than me

We extort them as soon as they record 'em, Bleek

My name is clear, back when a shorty used to braid my hair

On the project stairs, Once I drop to a ceaser Ma I don't need ya

>From the block to the hot two-seaters

Get ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke

Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc

It's Alright, you heard? It's Alright, Check



On the two Jew-el's I blew more money than Latrell, who else?

They don't know you, think they know you too well, you jell

Like Flubber I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set

Press you're brakes, Feds wanna investigate, Mr. I don't cop nothin

Less than eight, and anything involved with my name

Regardless of the fame

It's hard, I can't even walk through Harlem again,

Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express

My boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress

To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man fuck ya

I suggest let you live right? Negative, I swear

It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife

Close you're casket tight

Take you're last two deep breaths and pass the mic 

To Jay-Z nigga, That's Right!!



Bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball

Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss

It's Alright, you heard?, It's Alright, Holla back

Get ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke

There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?
How can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga 
he never even met that he dont even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

Y'all dont even know every day I'm livin with stress

Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest

Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless

I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest

You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?

I'try not to brush against they chest

You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped

Swear to everything when I leave this earth

It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt

You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine

We'll lose two lives, yours and mines

Gimme any amount of time dont let Ms. Carter grieve

at the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve

Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me

and I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged

Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God 

And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars...Lucky Me



[Chorus: Karen Anderson]



You only know what you see, 

You dont understand what it takes to be me.



I hate all girls with alterior motives

That's why I'm twenty plus years old, no sons no daughters

Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters

Hear the hate in my voice right? I hate that you noticed

Niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own

Hate a nigga like that faggot, get your own

Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome

Knowing one day Im'a have to flip, c'mon

You know the shit don't stop 'til the Crist don't pop

And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock

I'm trapped the whole worlds against me in fact,

It aint no turning back. Bring It On

Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much

Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?

Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us

Steady looking for flaws through us.... Lucky Me



[Chorus: Karen Anderson, Jay-Z]



You only know what you see, 

You dont understand what it takes to be me

You only know what you see, 

(Since I was 4 years old, I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold)

You dont understand what it takes to be me 

(And now that I've arrived

I see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold)



Nigga see you in the street, pretend to be friendly

But I know any type of success breeds envy

I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me

Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny

But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive 

Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up

And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up

Dont grieve for me my art remains

like a dart from the speaker to your heart

Spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal

Plan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life

Though I can't see past the girls greed to call her wife

Next time your thinking heist better be precise

Cause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here

I have no regrets even though I wanna see grow

My godsons Boogie, Sonny and Rimo

Bustin my toast off the roof drinkin 90 proof til spring

Real niggaz do real things, check



We started out makin, small time bacon

Two little niggaz bakin, talkin bout whippin cakes

Get clothin and big cheddar, hopin it gets better

We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever

In front of your buildin clockin, thought I was makin a killin

Right in front of your children, eightball in my side pocket

They was corrupt too, disrespectin the fiends I used to

look up to, take it or leave it, fuck you

In different parts of the planet, Oakland to New York

I'm hollerin Lifetimes, he hollerin Life's Too $hort

Parallel lives and jew-els held high

To the Range, to the Rove, get exchanged, for your souls

You know how the game goes, slang to get G's

and speak in Chinese everybody gains the same dough

Get your shit scarred fuckin with my sick squad

So now you own a record label, I got one too

We on a roll now, can't nobody stop our crew

You can treat us like convicts, you know we got records

On the shelf and on the charts the double deckers

The fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me

You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook?

I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways

so I can get paid, everday

I see the same old shit, I see in the streets

I know you think I'm sellin keys but I only sell beats

Dopefiend music, it's drug related

You can buy it on the corner get a radio and play it

It always sounds better when you turn it up loud

Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about

I know these gay ass record labels keep fuckin niggaz

It's just like in the streets main, how much you get?

[Too $hort]

That's right, I been a hustler for a long time

Always got the right beats, never saying wrong rhymes

I started off with nothing ended up with everything

Now we sip Hennessee in first class on every plane

Ask Jay-Z, he know what I'm sayin

Always see me at the bank and yes I'm goin again

There ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy

Fine women, a big house, a truck and a Caddy

Now peep, how sweet, niggaz lives can get

Put beef aside, the East and Westside connect

$hort Dawg, and Jigga with the, fo'-fo' flow

I got love for y'all motherfuckers y'all just don't know

I know y'all got a thing for them rag six-fo's

I like the five speed drops pop the clutch then go

If you want it, keep ballin, and if you jealous stop

I want Biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'Pac

How real is that?

[Pain In Da Ass] 
[*gunshots*] OKAY, I'M RELOADED!!! 
You motherfuckers, think you big time? 
Fuckin with Jay-Z, you gon' die, big time!

Here come the ""Pain""! [*gunshots*]



[Jay-Z]

Jigga... (Jigga), Bigga... (Bigga)

Nigga, how you figure... (how you figure)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, aiyyo



Peep the style and the way the cops sweat us (uh-huh)

The number one question is can the Feds get us (uh-huh)

I got vendettas in dice games against ass betters (uh-huh)

and niggaz who pump wheels and drive Jettas

Take that witcha..



[Notorious B.I.G.]

.. hit ya, back split ya

Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles

Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle

Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle

Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated 

Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related

Most hate it..



[Jay-Z]

.. can't fade it

While y'all pump Willie, I run up in stunts silly

Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me 

But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli 

Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin soft on him 

What's ya name?



[Notorious B.I.G.]

.. Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra

Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet

Tryin to push 700's, they ain't made them yet

Rolex and bracelets is frostbit; rings too

Niggaz 'round the way call me Igloo Stix (Who?)

Motherfucker!



[Chorus]

Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers

(Where you from?) Brooklyn, goin out for all

Marcy - that's right - you don't stop

Bed-Stuy.. you won't stop, nigga!



[Jay-Z]

What, what, what?

Jay-Z, Big' Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers

Brooklyn represent y'all, hit you fold

You crazy, think your little bit of rhymes can play me?

I'm from Marcy, I'm varsity, chump, you're JV

(Jigga) Jay-Z



[Notorious B.I.G.]

.. and Bigga baby!

My Bed-Stuy flow's malicious, delicious

Fuck three wishes, made my road to riches

from 62's, gem stars, my moms dishes

Gram choppin, police van dockin

D's at my doors knockin



[Jay-Z]

What? Keep rockin

No more, Mister, Nice Guy, I twist your shit 

the fuck back with them pistols, blazin

Hot like cajun

Hotter than even holdin work at the Days Inn

with New York plates outside

Get up outta there, fuck your ride



[Notorious B.I.G.]

Keep your hands high, shit gets steeper

Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank Wright

Leave the keys to your In-tegra (That's right)

Chill homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me

You're holdin more drugs than a pharmacy, you ain't harmin me

So pardon me, pass the safe, before I blaze the place 

and here's six shots just in case

(Brooklyn... Brooklyn... Brooklyn...)



[Chorus]

Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers

(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin out to all

(Crown Heights...) You don't stop

(Brownsville...) You won't stop, nigga!

(Brooklyn... Brooklyn... Brooklyn...)

Hah hah! Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers

(Where we from?) Brooklyn goin out to all

(Bushwick...) You don't stop

(Fort Greene...) You won't stop, niggaz!



[Jay-Z]

Yeah, yeah, yeah

For nine six, the only MC with a flu

Yeah I rhyme sick, I be what you're tryin to do

Made a fortune off Peru, extradite, china white heron

Nigga please, like short sleeves I bear arms

Stay out my way from here on (CLEAR?) Gone!



[Notoriuos B.I.G.]

Me and Gutter had two spots

The two for five dollar hits, the blue tops

Gotta go, Coolio mean it's gettin ""Too Hot""

If Fay' had twins, she'd probably have two-Pac's

Get it? .. Tu-pac's



[Jay-Z]

Time to separate the pros from the cons

The platinum from the bronze

That butter soft shit from that leather on the Fonz

A S1 diamond from a eye class don

A Cham' Dom' sipper from a Rosay nigga, huh?!

Brook-Nam, sippin on 



[Notorious B.I.G.]

Cristal forever, play the crib when it's mink weather

The M.A.F.I.A. keep canons in they Marc Buchanans

Usually cuatro cinco, the shell sink slow, tossin ya

Mad slugs through your Nautica, I'm warnin ya

(Hah, what the fuck?)



[Chorus]

Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers

(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin out to all

(Flatbush...) You don't stop

(Redhook...) You won't stop, nigga!

(Brooklyn... Brooklyn... Brooklyn...)

Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers

(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin out to all

(East New York...) You don't stop

(Clinton Hill...) You won't stop, nigga!

{*""Is Brooklyn in the house?""*}



[Outro]

Uhh, Roc-A-Fella, y'all, Junior M.A.F.I.A.

I'm feelin it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin it feel the Lex pushin up on the set
I'm feelin it through the high that you get from the lie
Feelin it if you feel it raise your l in the sky

[Verse 1:]



I keep it realer than most I know your feelin it

Cristal on ice I like to toast I keep on spillin it

Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this

On my back the fliest clothes lookin ill and shit

Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch 

And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick

Since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but 

Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher

We paid the price to circular success they turned my mic up

I'm 'bout to hit these niggas wit some shit that a light they life up

If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged

Nobody will fall cause everyone would be each others crutches 

I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it

These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it

Jiggy jigger lookin gully in the joint 

If y'all niggas ain't talkin 'bout large money what's the point?



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]



Even if it ain't sunny hey I ain't complainin 

I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplanin what shorty

(Where you disappear son?)

Maintainin puttin myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in

I'm livin the ill streets blues got you hunger painin

Nothin to gain and a whole lot to lose you still singin fool

I'm thorough in every boro my name be ringin

Warmin it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and 

Ya Feelin it? to all the girls I bought the girdle to conceal my bricks

No doubt they can vouch my life is real as shit 

95 south and poppy on the hill and shit

And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed wit shit

And all the thorough ass niggas that I hustle wit 

Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit

These fake rappers cant really know I'm lovin it ya feelin it



[Chorus x2]



[Verse 3:]



What y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay high? 

The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch

I keep it tight for all the nights my mom prayed I'd stop 

Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot

Those nightmares mom

Those dreams you say you got give me the chills

But these mils make me hot y'all feel me

Enough to stop the illin right?

But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 

I'm so confused

OK I'm gettin weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself

Look I don't need that now 

It just once in a blue moon when there's nothin to do and

The tension's too thick for my sober mind to cut through

I get to zonin, me and the chick on the island and we're bonin'

I free my mind sometimes I here myself moanin

Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone man

It got me goin shit

None of my friends speak
We're all trying to win, but then again
Maybe it's for the best though, 'cause when they're seeing too much
You know they're trying to get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldn't understand the

mechanics

And the workings of the underworld, granted

Nine to five is how to survive, I ain't trying to survive

I'm trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot

Life ills, poison my body

I used to say 'fuck mic skills,' and never prayed to God, I prayed to

Gotti

That's right it's wicked, that's life I live it

Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, endz

I break bread with the late heads, picking their brains for angles on

all the evils that the game'll do

It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us

And now we're lethal, infected with D'Evils...



We used to fight for building blocks

Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing

The closest of friends when we first started

But grew apart as the money grew, and soon grew black-hearted

Thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers

He never learned so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother

My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese

She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties

About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced

So I kept feeding her money 'til her shit started to make sense

Who could ever forsee, we used to stay up all night at slumber parties

now I'm trying to rock this bitch to sleep

All the years we were real close

Now I see his fears through her tears, know she's wishing we were still

close

Don't cry, it is the (beat?)

In time, I'll take away your miseries and make 'em mine, D'Evils...



My flesh, no nigga could test

My soul is possessed by D'Evils in the form of diamonds and lexuses

The exorcist, got me doing skits like Homie

You don't know me, but the whole world owe me

Strip!

Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life

So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothing nice

Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly

But now this higher learning got the Remy in me

Liquors invaded my kidneys

Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me

I can't be held accountable, D'Evils beating me down, boo

Got me running with guys, making G's, telling lies that sound true

Come test me, I never cower

For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers

Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die

And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'Evils..."

Yo whassup everybody this is Mariah Davis, Mad Wednesday's

Wait a minute; I see my man over there Jay-Z
Jay-Z, Dam Deass let me hear that lil' tape of yours, and it's fat
Why don't you come up here and kick a lil' freestyle

Put that champagne down, and kick a lil' freestyle for me tonight



[Jay-Z]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) [repeat 3X]

Y'all motherfuckers musta hear that Tribe Called Quest, let's do it again

Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) [repeat 3X]

Well I'm gone... check this out

Too much West coast dick-lickin, and too many niggaz on a mission

Doin your best Jay-Z rendition

Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions

that you're just a fish in a pool of sharks nigga, listen

Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a hoe

I'ma call you a hoe, too many bitches are shady

Too many ladies give these niggaz too many chances

Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is

Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances

No question; Jay-Z got too many answers

I been around this block, too many times

Rocked, too many rhymes, cocked, too many nines, too

To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together

Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever

I don't follow any guidelines cause too many niggaz ride mine

so I change styles every two rhymes, hah, what the fuck

That's 22 too's for y'all motherfuckers out there, yaknahmean?

Shall I continue? Check it out, what?



Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) [repeat 3X]

Well I'm gone... yo, yo, yo

Copped to reach my quota, push rock, roll up smooth like on ya

Whole groove like hold-up, swoll up

Too many faggot niggaz, clockin my spendin

Exercisin you're, gay like minds like Richard Simmons

If you could catch Jay right, on the late night

without the eight right, maybe you could test my weight, right

I dip, speak quicker than you ever seen

adminster pain, next the minister's screamin your name

At your wake as I peak in, look in your casket

feelin sarcastic, ""Look at him, still sleepin""

You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty

Mines thinkin longevity until I'm seventy

Livin heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?

Nigga ya broke, what the fuck you gon' tell me?



(""Oooooooooooh!"")



Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a fat track (aight)

Now this is comin on your new album, on Roc-A-Fella records in ninety-six

(no doubt no doubt) well, it is definitely the bomb

But you know I do wanna say somethin to you, I know

you've been havin a lot of problems with the law

But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%

Mad Wednesday's, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dang Dash

Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back anytime

(Hah, thanks a lot)

Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute

Ace, turn that music down

I smell some reefer, now you see?

That's why, our people don't have anything

Because we don't know how to go in places and act properly

(""Hey shut the fuck up!"")

Wait a minute wait a minute who told me shut the eff up?

Who told me to shut the eff up? Get him out of here

I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out

Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech

Thank you, he's out of here now, now like I was sayin

We gotta build our own business, we gotta get our own

record companies goin like Roc-A-Fella Records..."

Sunshine, geyeah
I sold it all from crack to o-pium, in third person
I don't wanna see em, so I'm rehearsin
with my peoples high to GM, from a remote lo-cation

in the BM, scopin the whole situation like, ""Dayamm!""

Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cre-am

but one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean

It's difficult to read em, the windows to his soul

are half closed, I put the key in

Pulled off slow, hopin my people flee-in

Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in

Coppers was watchin us through nighttime binoculars

This time they got us on tape, exchangin dope for dollars

Make me wanna, holler back at the crib in the sauna

Prayin my people bailed out like Time/Warner

Awaitin call, from his kin not the coroner

Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner

Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind

How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets

This time... stress... givin this shit up... fuck



[Chorus One:]



This is the number one rule for your set

In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

On the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget

In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

This is the number one rule for your set

In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

And through our travels we get seperated, never forget

In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets



As sure as this, Earth is turning souls burning

in search of higher learning turning in every direction seeking direction

My moms cryin cause her insides are dyin

her son tryin her patience, keep her heart racin

A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit

but it's this game love, I'm caught up all in it

They make it so you can't prevent it, never give it

you gotta take it, can't fake it I keep it authentic

My hand got this pistol shakin, cause I sense danger

like Camp Crystal Lake and

don't wanna shoot him, but I got him, trapped

within this infrared dot, bout to hot him and, hit rock bottom

No answers to these trick questions, no time shit stressin

My life found I got ta live for the right now

Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands

once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets



[Chorus Two:]



You used to hold me, told me that I was the best

Anything in this world I want I could posess

All that made me want is all that I could get

In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets... (when I was young)

[repeat 2X]



I found myself reminiscin, remember this one

when he was here he was crazy nice with his son

I miss him, long as I'm livin he's livin through memories

He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies

In heaven lookin over me, or in hell, keepin it cozy

I'm comin life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be

Remember Newton, mutual friend well me and him feudin

On your life I tried to talk to him

But you know niggaz, think they guns can stop foe niggaz

Frontin like they're, Big Willie but really old niggaz

Hoe niggaz, this year I'm sho' niggaz think I'm slippin

I'm bought to send you a roommate, no bullshittin

for my hustle's goin too well to hit him

You was right niggaz want you to be miserable wit em

Anyway, I ain't tryin to hear it, I think I'm touched

this whole verse I been talkin to your spirit, a little too much
