You say I coulda treated you better or whatever, but
I don't know, I think I did alright
Know what I'm sayin'?

And you know how you get

Drawin' conclusions like you got a Parsons degree or somethin'

I coulda treated you better, that's crazy

Nope



Lean in, lean in soda, Fanta, fantasizin'

That's not love you're in, it's more like compromisin'

I move mountains for you, fuck that social climbin'

Lean into me, lean into me

Yeah, lean in, lean into me



Pussy ain't makin' me tweak, ended up stayin' a week

She pretty but ghetto, pretty but rough, just like Virginia Beach

I wanna get back to the days that you loved me for nothin' but what you could see

You bust down the Jubilee, I swapped it and made you go factory, wait

You put some pain in me, I wanna get back to the major league

She wanna grab on the throttle, I wanna get back in the driver's seat

That nigga spent his last check on your car and you got it and drove it to me

Asked me if I coulda treated you better, but no



Lean in soda, Fanta, fantasizin'

That's not love you're in, it's more like compromisin'

I move mountains for you, fuck that social climbin'

Lean into me, lean into me

Lean in, lean into me



Yeah, yeah

Yeah

Grr, grr

Yeah



Our texts feelin' like a fencin' match, your temper shorter and I'm sensin' that

You keep talkin' 'bout some, ""Period,"" but where you 'bout to end the sentence at?

'Cause you been goin' off on my ass, then I tell your ass where I'm at

And you act like I'm not supposed to mention that

I introduce you to my friends' girlfriends, you ain't interested in makin' friends

Talkin' 'bout you wanna cook for a nigga in the kitchen, can you make amends?

Least we know you got the cakes on you, girl, you should prolly stick to bakin' then

Workin' this crop like the rubber chute, I swear that I'm not tryna smother you

I got to know a whole other you, but let's not forget how I discovered you

We ain't even gotta mention that, any nigga try and trouble you

He gon' find out that it's on-site like W-W-W

On site like dot-com, put a baby in you, a hot mom

Yeah, ask me if I coulda treated you better, but no

Not at all, not at all



I bet our mother would be proud of you, ooh (Mother would be proud)"

Sent more than your father ever sent

Spent more than your baby father did

Ayy, you my baby, so I gotta put you in the crib

I'm just doin' what that punk should have did (Thank you Lord)

She prayin' for me while I'm on the road

Prayin' for me while I hold her close

Prayin' that there's not no other girl

I'm prayin' that these girls'll never know

She prayin' asking God for a sign

I gave a fuck 'cause he said the economy was full

It was not full

He said, ""Economy was—""

He said, ""There was no first class, so we're sitting in economy""

I get up on that plane

I see so many seats in first class

Twelve, fourteen seats

Bruh

I sat in the back of the plane

Fucking crazy

And then, I go on that wack-ass vacation

The chef is feeding us the same meal every day like I was in jail still or something

I'm like, ""Why are we eating jerk chicken and oxtail every single day, can we switch it up?""

No, the oxtail was fire though, but can we switch it up?

I can't eat that shit every day, what?

You wanted to cry

You were lookin' for something

Man, this shit damn near big as the—



Big as the what? Big as the what? Big as the what?

Big as the Super Bowl

But the difference is it's just two guys playin' shit that they did in the studio

Niggas usually send they verses back to me and they be terrible, just like a two-year old

I love a dinner with some fine women

When they start debatin' about who the G.O.A.T

I'm like ""Go 'head, say it then, who the G.O.A.T.?

""Who the G.O.A.T.? Who the G.O.A.T.? Who the G.O.A.T.?""

Dissectin' my words and start lookin' too deep

I still wanna get me a song with YB

Can't trust everything that you saw on IG

Just know if I diss you, I'd make sure you know that I hit you like I'm on your caller ID

I'm namin' the album The Fall Off, it's pretty ironic 'cause it ain't no fall off for me

Still in this bitch gettin' bigger, they waitin' on the kid to come drop like a father to be

Love when they argue the hardest MC

Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?

We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammed Ali

Huh, yeah, yeah, huh-huh, yeah, Muhammed Ali

The one that they call when they shit ain't connectin' no more, feel like I got a job in IT

Rhymin' with me is the biggest mistake

The Spider-Man meme is me lookin' at Drake

Hate how the gang gotta wait for the boss, man, this shit like a prison escape

Everybody steppers, well fuck it, then everybody breakfast and I'm 'bout to clear up my plate (Huh, huh, huh)

When I show up, it's motion picture blockbuster

The G.O.A.T. with the golden pin, the top toucher

She call my number, leave her hangin', she got dry-cleaned

She got a Android, her messages is lime green

I search one name, and end up seein' twenty tings

Nadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen, Charlene, Pauline, Claudine

Man, I pack 'em in this phone like some sardines

And they send me naked pictures, it's the small things

You niggas is still takin' pictures on a dog stream

My youngers richer than you rappers and they all stream

I really hate that you been sellin' them some false dreams

Man, if your pub was up for sale, I buy the whole thing

Will they ever give me flowers? Well, of course not

They don't wanna have that talk, 'cause it's a sore spot

They know The Boy the one they gotta boycott

I told Jim and Jammer I use a GRAMMY as a door stop

Girl gave me some head because I need it

And if I fuck with you, then after I might eat it, wait

Niggas talkin' 'bout when this gon' be repeated

What the fuck bro? I'm one away from Michael

(6ix)



You bitches really get carried away

Makin' mistakes, then you beg me to stay

Got me wiggin' on you like I'm Arrogant Tae

You got my mind in a terrible place

Whipped and chained you like American slaves

Act like you not used to Sheraton stays

I met the nigga you thought could replace

How were there even comparisons made?

Bitch, next time, I swear on my grandmother grave

I'm slimin' you for them kid choices you made



Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slimin' you out



Ayy, this ain't the littest I could get on you bitches

Send wires on wires on wires like Idris

You lucky that I don't take back what was given

I could have you on payment plan 'til you're hundred and fifty

And my slime right here, she got some bars for y'all niggas

So I'ma fall back and let SZA talk her shit for a minute



Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slime



Damn, these niggas got me so twisted

How the fuck you so real, but play bitch on my line?

I can feel what you're spinnin'

Got too much pride to let no burnt nigga slime me out

Pull up, go write about

My night, got time, let's discuss all those lies about

Frontin' out here like you diggin' me out

And I ain't even cummin', I'm in and out

And you ain't 'bout the shit you rappin' about

And I can spin a ho, I'm airin' it out

I'm goin' off like a sawed-off

You tell these hoes you ain't cuddlin'

But with me, you know you doin' all that shit

You tellin' these hoes you ain't trickin' off

But with me, you know I'm gon' get it all

How you niggas get so carried away?

Trippin' when that dick is barely third place

Fucked out of pity, it's cute that you lame

Dip 'cause it's mid, I can't fake like it's hangin'



Slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out

Oh-woah, woah



Yeah

January, you pretend to see life clearly, yearly

February is the time that you put the evil eye and the pride aside

For the fantasy of gettin' married, very scary

March got you already second guessin' titles

April, spring is here and just like a spring, you start to spiral

May brings some warmer days, poolside, gettin' very tan

June have you movin' ice cold, goin' back and forth with a married man

July, that's when I found out you lied

August, it was ""baby"" this, ""baby"" that like you had your tubes tied

September, we fallin' off, but I'm still the man you tryna win over

October is all about me 'cause your turn should've been over

November got you moodboardin' for next year and you're single

December the gift-givin' month and now you wanna rekindle our year

Tryna build trust, showin' me your DMs, how they tryna bag you

Ironic how the news I got about you ended up bein' bad news

Get a nigga hit for fifty racks, girl, the beef cost like it's wagyu

Get a nigga hit, I'll make his ass see the light like a half-moon

Shout to QC, pretty sure I made Pee M's like it's past noon

All I really know is W's and M's, life lookin' like a bathroom

All I really know is M bags like I drove through and ordered fast food

Sayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings, who the fuck even asked you?

Seven bodyguards just in case somebody really wanna try and crash through

Don't know why I listen to you when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half-truths

If I don't pay your rent, it end up like an old hairstyle, girl, it's past due

If I don't—



Ah-ah-ah, that's as far as I got"

The girl that the boy cherishes workin' late night at the Pyramid, and it ain't right

Ain't something I can make right

Never say ""never,"" just say what it is

Act like you need some insurance on it

We didn't get here on accident

Don't make me bring out them racks again

Your two best friends are some savages

Swearin' it's different, not genuine

Movin' like Snoopy and Charlie Brown

Too many reasons why

I can't picture you with him

I swear that I wanted you back thеn

Waitin' on you like a backend

This can't be the shit that you doin' to me

All of them nights you was slidin' around

Told me what niggas was doin' to you

There's no way

Was man enough to tell you you was wrong

Man enough to not put it in a song

For the world to sing along

Man enough, I coulda told you on my own

Man enough to admit that

Paragraph I sent last night, yeah, I probably shoulda never sent that

And when you layin' on your stomach, only time I ever wanna get my lick back

How the outsiders know the inside? They was never supposed to get that, nah



And that's just so embarrassin'

I want to die, to die

You a trophy to me like the Larry

In Miami and the owls with me like they just put my ass in Gryffindor

Mouth dry over twenty that I never bother gettin' no prescription for

Steez sayin' that you miss me and I won't say it to you, but I miss you more

Said we got each other back and then you put the knife in it like the kitchen drawer

Way I'm feelin' on this album, really took it easy on you, coulda written more

If the shoe was on the other foot and it was me, it woulda been guerilla war

Since you know I got a soft spot for you, this has turned into a civil war

Artists hittin' on you, broke as fuck, I swear them niggas probably live in Singapore

The athlete that you rollin' with, I saw his game last night, he didn't score

Fuck, I gotta say a little more

Show you spots you never been before

It's fucked up that we was goin' once and now you're goin' twice like a biddin' war

Why you act like just 'cause I go to the strip club, girl, that I don't love you?

You still listenin' to R Kelly in the whip, baby girl, and I don't judge you

I still got some love deep inside of me

Please drag it out of me

You just might

Just might get that G-Wagon out of me

Please drag it out of me, please drag it out

Rollie gang, patty gang, rich baby daddy gang

I'm with Red like I'm at a Cincinnati game

Hood bitch, tat her gang 'fore she tat her name

Real bitch, held me down 'fore I had a name

Heard there's money on my head, what is that to me?

I put a hundred bands on him, he put a rack on me

We from two different worlds, but it's a match to me

The bend it over only time she turn her back on me (For real)



Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)

Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (Ho)

Hands on your knees (Ho), hands on your knees (Ow)

Shake that ass for Drake (Yup), now, shake that ass for me

Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)

Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees

Hands on your knees, hands on your knees

Shake that ass for Drake (Yeah), now, shake that ass for me



Your man so good and you deserve that in your suffering

I need a dick and conversation, can you cover me?

I had a feeling this is more than what we both say

I had a feeling this is more than a feeling

I can't let you get away

Feels good, but it can't be love

Ain't a damn thing that I do

Ain't a damn thing, oh



Bend that ass over (Ooh), let that coochie breathe (Ooh)

Shake that ass, bitch (Ooh), hands on your knees (Ooh)

Hands on your knees (All been there), hands on your knees

Shake that ass for Drake (Uh), now, shake that ass for me

Bend that ass over (Yeah), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)

Shake that ass, bitch (Yeah), hands on your knees (Hands on your)

Hands on your knees (Hands on your), hands on your knees (Yeah)

Shake that ass for Drake, now, shake that ass for me (Shake, shake, shake)



You like my voice, I turn you on

Red weave, it match my thong

He heard about me, know my song

I drive him crazy, can't leave me 'lone

Foreign trucks, I pull up

Thirty inches to my butt

Nails done, I'm fine as fuck

Niggas tryna see what's up



I'm lucky

I'm lucky

I'm lucky

I'm lucky



Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)

Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (Ho)

Hands on your knees (Ho), hands on your knees (Ow)

Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees

Hands on your knees, hands on your knees

Shake that ass for Drake (Yeah), now, shake that ass for me



You know the root of it

You know the lies and you know the truth of it

I see the future and I can see you in it

Girl, I'm not stupid, so don't play no stupid shit

I swear, poppin' my shit come with consequences

Post nut clarity, I came to my senses

I knew it was love when it started as a friendship

Askin' 'bout a baby, we should probably get a Frenchie

And take care of the dog

Take care of the dog

Until the dog days are over

The dog days are done

And you know I'm the one, I'm the one

The dog days are over, dog days are done

And you know I'm—



We was fuckin' night after night, I'll change your life

You ain't even know how to suck it right, I taught you right

You ain't even heard of Grace Bay 'til I bought the flight

You ain't even know how cold you was 'til I bought you ice

You can't even look at him the same, we a different type

You just text me trippin', I reply, ""Have a safe flight""

Wanna stick around for the ride, baby, hol' on tight"

Ayy, what?
It's so, is it real?
Yeah, ayy
Give a fuck if they remember

I was in the cold, windows froze, I was sleepin' in the whip tryna get a fucking grip

I remember

Didn't have no hoes tryna go, all these rappers lil' broed me, fuck, fuck

Fuck 'em, I remember

Way before they had a fuckin' DM, I was whippin' in the Ac' like that shit was European

I remember

I remember drivin' Holland Tunnel for a label meetin', thinkin' 'bout more cake than a funnel

I remember

Now these niggas don't remember

I know Neeks remember, I know Jay remember, Chubbs'll make them boys remember

Dead broke, splittin' pennies with my members

Fuck a spread, we was splittin' chicken tenders (I-I-I—)

'Member I was sleepin' in the basement, watchin' Tigger in the basement, I was tryna get a placement

I remember

Days in the East with the bros, watchin' Tristan and Devoe while they runnin' up the score

I remember

TT was headed to the league, I was sleepin' up at Metalworks tryna plant a seed

I remember

Rollin' through the city, gettin' beats, always peepin' out the streets 'cause I was beefin' with the bleeks

I remember

I was tryna get a portion, tryna make a fortune

B-Town with Candy, I'm tryna be her boyfriend

3 AM at Y2, runnin' off endorphins

Start adoptin' my brothers' beefs like a orphan

I was still on Rose when it's pourin' and stormin'

This shit is not rewardin', I do not feel important

I wanna see some scratch from the shit that I'm recordin'

In Memphis smokin' Blacks, tryna act like I enjoy them (I-I-I—)

Maurice François Girbaud what I'm sportin'

And Mos Def gave me like a rap for performin'

Crib I got now make me think of when I had to put some money on a mortgage



This don't feel like home anymore

It's just wall, doors, and floors

That only I can afford

Remember when it used to mean more, mean more

I got money in the top drawer

That ain't much, but we not poor

You're mine and I'm yours

Like a broke couple, we don't wanna court, for sure



I remember pullin' up at TAO, seein' Quincy Jones, nigga talkin' to me like he proud

I remember

I remember Mike designed the owl, then he sued the fucking guys, and he duckin' until now

I remember (I-I-I—)

'Member Reesie stayin' at the house, then she left me for my dawg like she never took the vow

I remember

My cousin Ryan fronted me a pound and I couldn't even flip it, had to bring it back around

I remember

I remember printin' up our T-shirts with Kyle, we in love with the same girl, beefin' like a cow

I would pick them shits up, nigga wouldn't even smile

Nigga better crack a smile 'fore we do a nigga foul

To keep it real, I wasn't really gangster 'til now

I was livin' on a cloud, I was quiet as a mouse

I was in the club gettin' lost in the crowd

Wasn't doin' what I wanted to, I do what was allowed

I remember fightin' over Monica with Jason

I remember only knowin' Andre and Jason

I remember buyin' all the iceberg from Jason

That's three different Jasons, my life like The Matrix (I-I-I—)

Even got on 106 & Park with Replacement

My mama was my manager, my uncle was my agent

Dr. Dre'll send a nigga home, that took patience

Four GRAMMY's to my name, a hundred nominations

Esperanza Spalding was gettin' all the praises

I'm tryna keep it humble, I'm tryna keep it gracious

Who give a fuck Michelle Obama put you on her playlist?

Then we never hear from you again like you was taken

Who the CEO of Universal? They mistaken

'Cause Google sayin' Lucian, but that just doesn't make sense

Who fillin' up the piggy bank? Who bringin' home the bacon?

This shit don't come on vinyl, I'm still record-breakin'

How could I forget? How could I forget?

I was on a Greyhound way before the jet

Buffalo, New York was like the furthest I could get

At the Walden Galleria tryna make the money stretch (I-I-I—)

Student Price Card and a Yorkdale connect

Whole time, Courtne Smith was keepin' me in check

Try and find an inch of the city I ain't stepped in

If it's war, I'll lay my life down for the set then



Yeah

And I put that shit on Mads and that nigga was my best friend

Yeah

And I put that shit on Johnny Bling, that nigga was my best friend

Tweakin' on vacation with me
You set limitations with me
Why do I get treated different?

I don't know how you run the bases with me

Then say nothing sacred with me

Why do I get treated different?

Sun is setting on the Atlantic, I bet a full moon is gonna show

Wondering what rocks your boat

What keeps your heavy heart afloat

I don't know, I don't know



Bipolar baby, seems like it just went undiagnosed

Blocked me on everything, that's so immature, so unprovoked, I

Don't even know why



Had to plans to understand ya

Mariana you broke my faith

Why you gotta listen to the propaganda?

Wе just broke the ice, and now you'rе both leaving

I was being kind, I don't understand ya

You should let your sister be the voice of reason

Either it's your text that I'm misreading

Or it's just your actions are misleading

Don't know how they do things in Pristina

I just know the tension is increasing

It's plenty people dead to me still breathing

Plenty other ways to get over people

You ain't had to step on me to gain freedom

No, no, you remind me of someone I think you know

You know and I know things that she didn't know

I'm not the same person I was five drinks ago

You tried to grease me, but we're not in Mykonos

I don't get hurt much, but I'm not invincible

Bidin' my time with you, then things got political

Oh, I read your last text, you're gettin' bold

Tellin' me what rocks your boat, what keeps your heavy heart afloat

I don't know



Bipolar baby, seems like it just went undiagnosed

Blocked me on everything, that's so immature, so unprovoked, I

Don't even know why

Don't know why



I adore

I adore you

Baby, I adore you

If I mentioned the pride before the fall

'Cause I wanna risk it all for you

What they say 'bout the writings on the wall?

No clue

One, one-one, one
Ayy, yeah
Look
The most decorated, competition decimated

My drive is dedicated, your drive is designated

Niggas got you to the spot and then you separated

Reasons for it speculated, we know how it escalated

Rarely celebrated, grade eleven educated

Radio is king again, Billboard got me regulated

Wanna makе it fair for you, numbers that I generatеd

Do right and kill everything, people knew that death awaited

Taylor Swift the only nigga that I ever rated

Only one could make me drop the album just a little later

Rest of y'all, I treat you like you never made it

Leave your label devastated

Even when you pad the stats, period, I never hated

Even when you stab me in the back, the vest is metal-plated

Tryna see a B inside my circle like I'm gettin' graded

Man, all this luggage in the lobby like I'm gettin' traded

Every time you need me for a boost, I never hesitated

Every time that Yeezy called a truce, he had my head inflated

Thinkin' we gon' finally peace it up and get to levitatin'

Realize that everything premeditated

Everyone was good with me, then everyone expression faded

Tickin' time bomb and they beggin' me to detonate it

If I press this red button, dog, everybody Heaven Gated

Press this red button, dog, and everything forever changes

Word to M-Dolla, she the only one could maybe save it

Should've hit you first, but, sis, you know about the shit I've taken

Niggas think it's sweet, but I am not a diabetic patient

No

I will start blackin' over here like it's segregation

I will fuckin' double-cross you niggas like it's meditation

I'll give you a hard pill to swallow, this your medication

I will fuckin' pop up on your ass like a revelation

I could tell you better than I show you, this a demonstration

I will fuckin' leave you in the dirt like some vegetation

Chemicals is mixin' in my brain and killin' hesitation

I will fuckin' force a few shots like a vaccination

Niggas fuckin' call me up to cap, this not a graduation

I will fuckin' put your ass on pause like I'm Pastor Mason

I will set alarms off and cause a whole evacuation

I'll fuckin'—, I'll fuckin'—

I'll get to you ten years from now like procrastination

I'll fuckin' find out wherever y'all are celebratin'

Pull up, park my Phantom on the curb like I'm Larry David

And then we'll see who's really crazy

Yeah, right back
I walked in the studio, Noel said ""I thought that you quit?""
I said ""Nah, I'm quittin' again 'cause I started again""
Gotta wait on that
This like the storm before the calm, we'll get to the vacation later

For real

Ayy

Look

Look



This is the decompress before the intermission

Done a lot of postgame talkin', but this one different

I told Lee to put him in the car, but don't pistol whip him

And definitely do not shoot his ass 'til you get permission

People got a heavy misread on my disposition

Talkin' loose, then hit me up after on some ""Please, Drake listen, listen""

Energy they bringin' is inconsistent

I got two Virgil Benzes, one that I'm whippin' right now

And the other one, I'm keepin' in mint condition

And niggas bound to slip eventually like they sent permission

Imagine us gettin' our validation from an ex-musician searchin' for recognition

Same story every time, they heckle in repetition

I'm top of the mountain, these niggas still down at base camp, they plannin' they expedition

Y'all the type to catch a charge, head to the deposition

And act like the rapper named after the sex position

But let me tell you 'bout my brother, though

Let me tell you 'bout my brother, though, for real

Let me tell you 'bout my brother

Man, let me tell you 'bout my brother, though

My brother a tool toter, my brother a tombstoner

Diamonds and violence made us bond, we grew closer

Brother a clip loader, my brother a sick soldier

That nigga stick'll it to you for real, he a lint roller

My brother a aim botter, I bought him a Range Rover

My brother a flame thrower

It's like he playin' EDM, that nigga a chain smoker

Niggas want smoke with us, I promise, it's game over

Get your ass twist right here, he a kane roller

And then you niggas whine to J Prince, like some grape growers

Man, what the—?



Got it to here with that shit

Let me tell you 'bout my brother, though

Yeah

I mean, enough about me (Conductor)

Let me tell you 'bout my brother, though



'Cause I'll backhand you boys with my writing hand

You niggas do your shootin' on the web, you Spider-Man

My brother robbin' it down to you junes like Iron Man

My brother make your ace disappear like a slight of hand

My brother carry bundles and extensions like hair stores

It's me, him, and a white ting, we movin' like Paramore

He into some shit that they call internal affairs for

I'm someone he care for, I'm someone he there for

My brother put some holes in your top, you a Air Force

I should charge for interviews, they want me to share more

A ticket just to check in with the boy, like the airport

This the part of the story you wasn't prepared for

Let me tell you 'bout my brother, though

My brother say I'm better than everyone, he biased as fuck

Blood is thicker than water, nigga, his iron is up

And if you keep eyein' me down, trust me, his iron is up

Your last album was buns, you niggas Hawaiian as fuck

Niggas so down bad, they makin' alliances up

Cliquein' up with haters that was thinkin' of signin' to us

Knowin' good and well, that when I drop, they inspired as fuck

Secret admirers too embarrassed, they hide in the cut

CN Towerin' over you niggas, I'm giant as fuck

Wait on whoever to say whatever, they quiet as fuck

The city don't love you like that and they fryin' you up

I can't wait for the day that you choose to retire your stuff

Takin' off the sneakers 'cause you tired of tyin' 'em up

That one day you wake up and tell 'em ""Enough is enough""

That's how you gon' find out you not Kobe Bryant to us

Man, you not Kobe Bryant to us, at all

And if them hoes really love you, then them hoes, they lyin' to us

They say they miss when you got 'em wet and you dryin' them up

Also don't doubt that you sent them here, and they spyin' on us

Man, either way, nigga, beware of the dog, deep in my character flaws (Conductor)

Humble back in 2012, now I give arrogant bars

I remember blue streak with Neeks, we sharin' Lacoste

Now we go for dinner and we joke about sharin' the cost

Got me a ranch in the H, fuck all the carryin' cause

Boy, I'm on top of the cake, just like some caramel sauce

Fuck all the settlin' down, these boys married in-laws

I go for dinner, they wife is there and she starin' across

God forbid I take her and they suffer a terrible loss, yeah

But enough about me

To all the super triggered women talkin' down on me

Relax, drink some water, act like you somebody daughter

Can't get a tan from your phone light

Baby, it's late June, open the blinds, get out The Shade Room

Maybe you could stop gettin' involved in some shit when you not involved

Or maybe you go for a walk somewhere that is not a mall

What's your baby's shoe size? Could tell by the laces, they tight

Aw, you only focus on the steps that I'm taking in life

And then you got the ones who claim a guy that's everyone's nigga

Leave for a month to Colombia and now everything bigger

Even your attitude is bigger, your appetite growing

Your nigga is not even a starting QB

That nigga on the field before the game, he just practicin' throwing

What happened to sellin' real estate? Where all that shit was goin'?

All your fuckin' captions lately talkin' 'bout happy and glowin'

All of that snappin' and posin'

Whole time, he jealous of your past, who the fuck was your last?

Askin' questions 'bout niggas, and you get slapped in the face if you happen to know him

Domestic abuse, that man is not a man for you, he's a pathetic excuse

Lyin' through your teeth, scared of lettin' your skeletons loose

But you stick around, 'cause who's out there that's better for you?

Plus he paid the surgeon so your ass could get a caboose

But he wants you covering it up, so your dresses is loose

Plus it's the only thing they see when you get introduced

Now you on a flight to Bogotá just to get it reduced, good Lord

More weeks of recovery clinics, front like you love every minute

You gettin' pushed to the brink, you sittin' at double your limit

Meanwhile, that nigga out in my city fuckin' on bitches

If they even mention me and showin' me love, then it's finished

Jealous-ass niggas

Damn

Then you got the ones that travel 'cross the globe

Everything is paid, they don't need a man

Don't listen to Drake, never been a fan

You got a million hoes, yeah, I understand

I'm never fuckin' you, so take that out your plans

I'm good on all you niggas 'til a ring is on my hand

Then I search your name, find you on the 'Gram

Click the Linktree and see you suckin' dick on cam, what the fuck?



Oh, hell no

It can't be

Not Mrs. Independent, dude

Nah

So, uh



To all the ladies wonderin' why

Drake can't rap like that same old guy

It's 'cause I don't know how anymore

I don't know how, yeah

I've had my beliefs tested, my faith broken in half

I try to joke and I laugh

But I just don't know how anymore, love

I just don't know how, yeah



To all the ladies on my case with a look on they face

Allow me to put these bums right back in they place

For all the niggas who act twelve

The fake gangsters with a MAC-12

The ones that only hit your phone up when it's past twelve

Baddies not the only ones worried 'bout strikin' a pose

You orderin' one bottle to split between five of the bros

All your boos think it's Halloween and they went ghost

That's when you go Miami on the 'Gram and you rent boats

And now they thinkin' you sweet with the bread like French toast

You boys becomin' detectives, but ain't in no trench coats

I would never guess that you niggas is this crazy

She took dick in Ibiza, you turn into Dick Tracy

You niggas so jaded

Actin' Hulk tough, but you only turn green because your necklace is gold-plated

She settled for an NBA star that's through playin'

Instead, she got an NBA fan that's 2K-in'

She lookin' for high ground, hate bein' tied down

She loved you for the first year, but those feelings died down

She livin' in downtown, you live with your parents still

You don't own a steering wheel, so you can't even drive down

You downloaded the My Mercedes app for some time now

To track when she ride 'round

You know where she goin' before she there, it raise eyebrows

You hackin' her iCloud, you committing cyber crimes

You niggas is out of line

She's finally movin' on, she's only said it a thousand times

You sold her a dream, talkin' that give you the world shit

Her friends wanna get her back on that diamonds and pearl shit

I mean, it was girls there, but it wasn't a girls trip

She met a guy

She met a guy that ain't just gettin' by, a better guy

She 'bout to spread her wings and you just gotta let her fly

You know you can't control a Gemini, that's facts

She like, ""Shh, quiet, everybody, the game started

My new boo hoopin' tonight and he said he play at the Garden

He said if I ain't watching, then that nigga ain't startin'""

She point to the guy that she talkin' 'bout and it's James Harden



Damn, dog

Lost your, lost your girl to The Sniper, huh?

13, good God

I feel for you, bro

Look



So, to all the ladies wonderin' why

Drake can't rap like that same old guy

It's 'cause I don't know how anymore

I really hate the fact I make this shit sound effortless

Black America love to remind me what my mama look like

As if I'd ever fuckin' forget

I'm never enough

Much to their dismay, I'm levelin' up, yeah

There's too much treasure to hunt, there's too many hoes in the spot

The ratio seven to one

Livin' for right now 'cause I really think heaven's a front

Nadia died in Dubai

I waited on a spirit to come by for like seventeen months

That shit didn't visit me once, damn

She wanted a better life

She wanted some opportunity, we wasn't given a bunch

Her ex would eat away at her soul, that nigga a munch

The last message she sent to my phone's about keeping in touch

So pardon me questioning God and not believing in much

It's Wick, man, don't listen to Wikipedia

Capo a wicked nigga, I pray it don't hit the media

They say, ""Drake, you gettin' harder, funny is getting easier""

Rappers are slick comedians, and they get disobedient

And they don't stay in they lane, it's like niggas hit the median

Boat say he the recipe, I must be the key ingredient

Capo might wick a man down with evil deviance

They gon' have to talk to Ouija boards like heebie jeebian

Like the large was too big for you, you'll need a medium

Just to send a message to somebody you loved previous

Empty clips, yeah"

Everything pure
(You've got to change your evil ways, if you wanna keep that—)



Yeah, I got some evil ways

Even through the glasses, you can see the gaze

To find your way up to the top, this shit gon' be a maze

Volkswagon, shit the way I'm runnin' Beatles' plays

Yeah, and we linkin' like we freed the slaves

I conquered hell, I walked thе 'Ville and set my feet ablaze

My hеart hardens every year like sneakers that Adidas made

I never did the VMAs, I'm not in need of praise

All praise to the born sinners Jesus saves

My brothers runnin' through the 6ix like the green berets

Beefin' with a block that's five hundred feet away

Wheel of fortune, shit, the way they say they need a K

Nah, uh, I only need a raise

And a safe to stash these Frito Lays

Times was hard, I watched my mama robbin' hard just to get Peter paid

And now my paper folded like when teachers don't want classmates to see your grade

Time is speedin' now, I see the greys pokin' out this beard, but it's weird 'cause I feel like I ain't even age (Yeah)

Y'all seize the rage, feet firmly planted for these precious flowers I've been handed, watch me be the vase

Man, I'm livin' out Carlito's way

You niggas ain't gettin' no bread, you in a keto phase

Wisdom comin' out my mouth like some teethin' pain

My whip used to have the seat displays where S.M.A.C.K. DVD would play

Zopiclone baby, I can't rest without the sleepin' aids

Bought this nigga jewels, these shits is light, let's get it reappraised

I bet you see the price and you gon' be amazed

And broski didn't do it, he like a piece of art, judge, he was framed

Some feed the J's to receive a wage

Coke got they nose bleedin' like the seats where you can't see the stage

High up in arenas where they see their faves

AKA me and Drizzy Drake, we the wave

Uh, yeah, we the wave

Like Christian Combs with a brush in his hand once the grease is laid

Shit is 360 like the label deal you signed to get your people paid

Me, I got tickets like a meter maid

And 21 my nigga like he celebrate a legal age

Next time I get in Rosalia face

I hope she tell her people that we need some space

Niggas think I won't get 'em hit but like like an Indian marriage, it could be arranged

Diss me, and you just may see us on your block like the street parade

At the top, playin' keeper way with the crown

Our life's an open book, come and read a page

Drake pulled a white bitch that's goin' both ways, she like the queen of spades

I'm startin' to think they percs is fake, they weed is laced

For thinkin' it's a game, if it's a game, these streets would be the Bushido's blade

Razor to his face and he ain't need a shave

I stay out of beef, see niggas' DNA get rearrangedI'm with Drizzy in Atlanta, so many hitters with that nigga, they could be the Braves

Young angel goin' through his demon phase

Hard to blame 'em, Lord knows this game could be depraved

Scary Hours undefeated, y'all should be afraid

Yeah, y'all should be afraid



Ooh, ways, if you wanna to keep that guy

You've got to change your evil ways, if you wanna keep that

You broke my heart, you broke my heart



It hurts

I put careers on shelves like Amazon distribution center help

Really hate to call lil' broski for the dirty work, I'd rather do it by myself, grrah, grrah, grrah

My tour route'll leave a lazy nigga dizzy

Got more tracks than when a hair salon is busy

Flow for days like that River Mississippi

Freaky nigga like I sing with Pretty Ricky

Huh? Yeah, yeah

Got the adlibs from Smiggy

Nails done, but my trigger finger itchy

Clutchin' on a blicky, shit is gettin' tricky

Pushed to the edge like Vert

On Instagram, diggin' up dirt

You wanted smoke with me first

Down bad boys, sad boys, I been representin' since birth

Yeah, I would die bad 'bout you, but I'm 'bout to have you down worse

I introduce you to my friends' girlfriends, you ain't interested in makin' friends

Talkin' 'bout you wanna cook for a nigga in the kitchen, can you make amends?

Least we know you got the cakes on you, girl, you should prolly stick to bakin' then

Workin' this crop like the rubber chute, I swear that I'm not tryna smother you

I got to know a whole other you, but let's not forget how I discovered you

We ain't even gotta mention that, any nigga try and trouble you

He gon' find out that it's on-site like W-W-W

Give a fuck if they remember

I was in the cold, windows froze, I was sleepin' in the whip tryna get a fucking grip

I remember

Didn't have no hoes tryna go, all these rappers lil' broed me, fuck, fuck

Fuck 'em, I remember

Way before they had a fuckin' DM, I was whippin' in the Ac' like that shit was European

I remember

I remember drivin' Holland Tunnel for a label meetin', thinkin' 'bout more cake than a funnel

I remember

Now these niggas don't remember

I know Neeks remember, I know Jay remember, Chubbs'll make them boys remember

Dead broke, splittin' pennies with my members

Fuck a spread, we was splittin' chicken tenders (I-I-I—)

'Member I was sleepin' in the basement, watchin' Tigger in the basement, I was tryna get a placement

I remember

Days in the East with the bros, watchin' Tristan and Devoe while they runnin' up the score

I remember

TT was headed to the league, I was sleepin' up at Metalworks tryna plant a seed

I remember

Rollin' through the city, gettin' beats, always peepin' out the streets 'cause I was beefin' with the bleeks

I remember

I was tryna get a portion, tryna make a fortune

B-Town with Candy, I'm tryna be her boyfriend

3 AM at Y2, runnin' off endorphins

Start adoptin' my brothers' beefs like a orphan

I was still on Rose when it's pourin' and stormin'

This shit is not rewardin', I do not feel important

I wanna see some scratch from the shit that I'm recordin'

In Memphis smokin' Blacks, tryna act like I enjoy them (I-I-I—)

Maurice François Girbaud what I'm sportin'

And Mos Def gave me like a rap for performin'

This don't feel like home anymore

It's just wall, doors, and floors

That only I can afford

Remember when it used to mean more, mean more

I got money in the top drawer

'Member Reesie stayin' at the house, then she left me for my dawg like she never took the vow

I remember

I would pick them shits up, nigga wouldn't even smile

You know where this shit 'bout to go, 'cause nobody touchin' the flow

They say you alone at the top, but it's gotta be lonely below

You boys gettin' ready to diss, but don't even mention the O

And don't even mention a foe unless you boys tryna go broke



Ah damn, man, you niggas is the worst

Savage snatch you out ya crib, then drop you in a hearse

Baby, please, when we nervous, stop reachin' in your purse

Nigga went and bought a house when he coulda bought a verse

Niggas dumb as fuck, imagine if I did that stupid shit when I was comin' up

My crib feel like a hedge fund, I be in here just thumbin' up

Know I'm SN1, 'til I'm done fuckin' London up

Niggas make me nauseous, I had enough of broke boys

I can't talk to broke boys, yeah, I can't talk to broke boys

I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys, wait, yeah

I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys, wait

All you niggas make me sick

All you niggas rappin' 'bout the bricks and the licks

Then I hear in real life you livin' with your bitch

I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys

I can't talk to broke boys

I don't want no convo I don't got no time for

Niggas postin' mansion, livin' in a condo

Y'all be make believin', I can't not relate to you

I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys

I cannot believe y'all was dissin' on the old boy

I can't even think on how you came up with that flow, boy

Please talk to someone else 'cause I can't talk to broke boy

I can't talk to broke boy, I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys

I can't talk to broke boys, nah, nah, I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to—

Look

Long way from sentimental

Meet Thomazzo and Ernesto

Short rigatoni with the pesto

These verses are my manifesto

Hallways got an echo

Me and Smigs on the loose in the city, you know how the rest go

Casual sex, I'm like, ""Fuck a dress code""

The first martini is an espresso

Chill shot glasses with prosecco

Niggas so ignorant in our hood, they be like, ""Why thе fuck you makin' techno?""

I'm worldwide and this is just another cargo jеt flow, I had to let go

Life insurance policies, you niggas 'bout to need the gecko

I got some meaner threats, though

Me, Spider-Man, and Leonardo, I'm back tomorrow

I had the chopper to a wedding out in Monaco or Monte Carlo

I'm losin' track of where we all go

I wouldn't trade my life for none of y'alls, it's an embargo

Fifty-nine bags on the 767, this is heavy cargo

Yeah

Fifty-nine bags on the—, ayy

Swedish jail cell smellin' like some Carby Musk

For your birthday, your boyfriend got a party bus

Bottle signs, club lines, should've come with us

We left that shit in '09 when we was comin' up

I mean, these just my suggestions of course

I'm ridin' here fresh off divorce

And I'm tryna look in her eyes, maybe express my remorse

If she want a rebound with me, I'm down to go get her some boards

I'm here for the moral support

Whippin' the Vespa off of six tequilas

Big Benjamins like the Pittsburgh Steelers

Drake, you got it

Robert Kraft sent the jet for us, that shit was patriotic

You would think we live in Baltimore, the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product

Teachin' niggas how to mind they business, and my latest stuff

Might be the only teacher that gets paid enough

That's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods

You niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris

If we don't like you, you payin' tax and tariffs

Come to the 6 and I'm like the actin' sheriff, deputy

First got to America, niggas wouldn't check for me

No chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy

They underestimated my trajectory

But now they gotta pay that shit direct to me

I send the label bills, bills, bills like the other two women standing next to Bey, that shit was just—

Independent women is lovin' the new appearance

Matter of time before I go net a Bey like a Paris

Like, ""Honey, you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus""

I got my head in the clouds, I'm serious

The lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods

Promise you'll get that shit when the sky clears

This shit designed for divine ears

My favorite two words from you white boys is, ""Sign here""

And then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers

Swear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years

And then we 'bout to kick this shit in high gear

Eight karats like vegetarians, nigga, the earrings are droopy

Contract Lord of the Rings, think it's a script for the movie

Shout out TVGUCCI, my cousin is spooky

I swear you don't even mean what y'all say like y'all dubbin' a movie

Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie

He claim we don't got a problem but

No, boo, it is like you comin' for sushi

We might pop up on 'em at will like Suzuki

Kawasaki, sushi, saké, the money grow on trees like shiitake

They tried to get spicy with me, so I wonder how they gon' stop me

I'm really on a roll like hamachi

The fuck would y'all really do without me?

For your birthday, your man got a table at Hibachi

Last time I ate there, Wayne was doin' numbers off the cup like Yahtzee

And Paris Hilton was steady duckin' the paparazzi

Quavo might've sent me a song that he called ""Versace""

I really can't remember it properly

All I know is that God got me, I'm sittin' on large properties

Treat me like a newborn, Lucian not droppin' me

I'm goin' Pink Floyd, you niggas cannot rock with me

She could be givin' me head and somehow you not toppin' me

Niggas see the 6ix God pass, they high-fivin' me

Need to be high-sixin' me

Swear niggas highkey sick of me

They wifey on my head 'cause I vibe differently

Feel like an AMBER Alert the way that I can take her to the mall and she find Tiffany

I'm like a cup holder the way that these dimes stick to me

They should've been in the fountain based on what y'all wishin' me



Know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah

Million-dollar spot (Brr, brr)

That's how motherfuckers in CMB play it

Middle of the ocean (Blatt)

Just like that (Shine, shine)

All dark fresh green water

Land that thing

With 'bout a hundred hoes

We up and we livin' like that, boy

Fresh fly fish like, you understand me, like, real G shit

You hear me? A neighborhood superstar

It's bigger than anything

You know, we start from the bottom, then we come to the top

Get to the top and we stay up there

You hear me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)

We look down and we'll be down, but we stayin' up

And we rise up, we stay on 'em, you heard me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)

Big Florida water, big water ocean

On that type of time

You understand me?

Rich nigga, rich life, you understand me?

Come from the bottom, but we come from the bottom (Rich life)

But we understand the bottom 'cause we come from it

And we live with it (You understand?)

Go to our grave 'bout this here, boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)"

Takin' less L's, makin' more M's

Put her Skims on, now she actin' like she Kim

Take it to the paint, take it to the rim

You look good on camera, baby, let's go make a film



Big diamonds, Big Puns, VS1's

Long guns, home runs, I'm the don

I can hang in the trenches with no one

Plenty switches with extensions, it's no fun

Givin' out spankings

Ridin' with lil'— 'cause he shoot without thinkin'

Baptize a nigga, send him home in a blanket

Upgrade a bitch and put some diamonds in her anklet

Better not get no throw up on my seat, I know you drinkin'

You ain't fuck no rapper, you a dinosaur, you ancient

I like fried rice, you better cook like you an Asian

Wrote a lot of verses, but I never wrote no statement

I been in them rooms, I never did no contemplatin'

This bitch wanna argue, I ain't doin' no debatin'

Seen her with her nigga, waved my hand, I'm like, ""Hey, friend,""

Lookin' at the Shade Room, that shit be entertainin'

Dissin' on his album and it flopped, he deserved it

Come up out that booth and bring that energy in person

Got so many hits, it wouldn't be fair to do no verses

I could really go five hours in the stadium

What happened to that nigga claiming OVO? We traded him

Thought I was a popstar, I'm Slaughter Gang, I baited 'em

Walk around like Prince 'cause I got a lot of lady friends

Used to be in 'Sauga out at Sega City Playdium

Skatin' through this album like a Montreal Canadien

Way that I ran shit, you'd think I was Iranian

Niggas see my deal, look at they deal and now they hate the kid

Fuck, let me kick it basic

Niggas ain't got love for the boy, so they fake it

Crack a couple jokes to some bitches on some snake shit

But if I send a verse to they ass, then they'll take it

Shoot a video, arm around me like we aces

Or pop out at my shows, jump around with me on stages

Probably why these hoes love to shower me with praises

Might've fucked a rapper, girl, but you ain't fucked Drake yet

So now what's the problem?
Don't go hiding again
Tired of asking where you been
You left so abruptly

I guess it's fuck me

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

I'm the first evеr antisocial socialite

Have me workin' 'til it's 2049

And get hate when I tell you, ""Oh, some other time""

Like I really got some other time

You just tell me, ""Never mind""

Know I sound crazy to a lazy mind

Know it'll be a different kind

Shout out to the people workin' nine to five

I be workin' nine to nine

And the six upside down, it's a nine

You already know the vibe

And they leave 'cause of pride, but they comin' back every time

The devils that I recognize, most of them got pretty eyes

Titties and some plans of just gettin' by, that's the way they live or die

Easy to judge, but, girl, who am I?

Truth or dare, I'ma take a double dare

Truth is a suicide

I would rather live a lie, keep you on the outside

Introduce you to the guys

Have you throwin' up the south side like you're one of mine

But you're not one of mine

You belong to everybody else when you're bored in your free time

Shit could make a thug cry, play it like a tough guy

Couldn't even land in the Hamptons, they didn't have the stairs for the shit I fly

Swear it's like a metaphor, I can't even get down from the shit I climb

Can't even get down from the shit I climb

Yeah, girl, you're my size

Make me tell you one time

We was on the front line, shit was in my bloodline

Waitin' for the sunshine

But the sun never shines on me, on me

Sleepin' in the whip sometimes, girl, I was sleepin' upright

Henny, red cup life, broski kept it tucked tight

Niggas talkin' bad shit about what they gon' do to mine

Aw, now their tongues tied

We was smokin', watched the sun climb

I would trap until my thumbs cried

Tryna change it all in one line

Never seen a thug cry

Love, it's been a long time

Bet you never seen a thug cry

Hit me on my hotline

And no, ma, I'm not fine at all



Don't go hiding again

Tired of asking where you been

You left so abruptly

I guess it's fuck me

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

Tell me, what did I do wrong?

It's a deep one

You say I changed, I say that I millions, I did

The toughest act to follow's back on tour

Off-road Maybach, Pyrex trap

Virgil came back through the boy, damn

That's somethin' to me, niggas really had they back turned to me

I ain't talkin' my assistant when I say niggas down to pack somethin' for me

Then they thought they had the trap set for me

How you really think that went for me?

Niggas gotta do a fact check for me

When everything is put to rest

And everybody takes a breath

And everything gets addressed

It's you alone with your regrets

All that pumpin' up your chest

All that talk about the best

You know how sticky it gets



Like, we weren't supposed to come up with something this clean

Like something happened"

Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortune on me

I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me

My parents divorce is on me

My therapist's voice is making the choices for me

And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me

My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me

No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour

How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?

How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?

How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?

Windows of opportunity let me go through the doors

This the part where I don't ever say ""Pardon me"" anymore

This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore

This the part where all my partners know what we in it for

This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war

Picture me rolling through downtown in a A4

Picture my signature on a pair of some J 4s

Picture me carin' what niggas sayin' on Wi-Fi they don't pay for

Knew I needed love, but I think I value the hate more

To push towards things that I prayed for

Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for

And don't you dare hit me back with no ""K, sure""

Soon as I tell you that you the one I would wait for

You too saucy, too flossy, you moved in and moved off me

All to be with niggas who just startin' to move bossy

Maybe I just handled you too softly

Them boys got no Kelis in they blood

If your whole heart wasn't in it, I know a piece of it was

Posted that pic you sent me, it wasn't recent enough

How I'm supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough

You love getting T'd up

Love showin' the cakes, you know that they eat it up

Love touching the road as soon as it's heatin' up

Invited you over, you said that you showin' up

All them spelling mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck

All them other mistakes, let's let it be what it was

Them niggas just can't understand it

I want you to change my mind, I'm praying you pulling up

Know who you be around, I know that they teaming up

Telling you you better off leavin' me in the dust

People don't wanna see me succeed, this shit come with that
Even when I come back, I don't know if it's gonna be me that's gonna be coming back

Soon as I left, I had to make peace with that

Dropped out of school 'cause nobody was teaching that

The Best Western is where a nigga was sleeping at

Daemen College booking me to pull up and speak the facts

Even if they make a movie 'bout us, this shit'll be hard to re-enact

Dislocated shoulder, it's hard to be always reaching back

All these IOU's, it's hard for me to be keeping track

Friends that dedicated they life to just keepin' me intact

Hard to pay 40, pay Noel, pay Niko back

All the nights I needed to vent to someone and CJ sat

All the nights Chubbs was pulling up where I need him at

All the times Mark was making sure that my luggage packed

At times he had to double back (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

I mean, even with his salary, you can't put no prices on that

There is no salary cap, there is no payin' him back, for real

I wonder what it could've been if I had snakes in the mix

Actually, I never wanna know 'cause we made it like this

Shots gotta fly either way, now I make it or miss

Overtime, I was all good, we take it in shifts

What would you do if it wasn't this? That's a hard one

The finish line is where I like to pull up and start from

Pain is just a place that I go to get the bars from

I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied

I be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line

And I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline

Sometime it's louder than the voice I got in my mind

I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time

Like, how they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?

They've been tryna push a narrative since '09

And they even had my ass convinced a couple times

But that ain't even the half, I had tougher times

Only look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes

And it's whatever with them niggas on the other side

We got problems we could never really put aside

I cracked the door 'fore I saw her put my foot inside

I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die

So now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die (Yeah)

My hard work doesn't just pay off, it pays all the family debts off

I'm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff

Houses paid off, label paid off

My soul for the money wasn't the trade-off

Unlike most of you boys that fade off

I feel guilty taking some days off

Please don't google my net worth, the numbers are way off

I mean if you comparin' it to what I really made off with

I'm more like Bernie with all the earnest that they came off

Trust me it was nothin' light, holmes

They tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home

I know you love me

Can't picture bein' a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on

Unless Kawhi wanna run it back

Other than that, the strings'll be unattached

Certified Lover Boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that

Y'all music is watered down, will you love 'em back?

And you know what I'm on, blowing past ya, owning masters

Said you're like a father figure to me, but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard

Oh of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more

Soft spot for all the ones that came before, I can't ignore it

I'm always tryna rekindle

From the bottom the to the top, man, what's it like in the middle?

From the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter

To my dogs in the game who wasn't pick of the litter

Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi

Whatever's in me, it's takin' over

I gotta bust it down, break it open

Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'



Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'

Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in

Now we rollin'

Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'

Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in

Now we rollin'



Look

Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing

Back when the house that I own now was my home screen

Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team

Runnin' missions

Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians

Back when hotlines were still flippin'

Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different

Transitions, plans switchin', ambition

Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera

Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla

I always had a little somethin' extra

Back when Corey was our sole investor

And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya

Look, I ain't no baller

Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller

My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers

And easin' tensions

Keepin' family out of East Detention

And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center

Spots we got no business enterin'

Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye

I had to find a way to get someone's attention



Then we rollin', then we rollin'

Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in

Now we rollin'

Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'

Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in

Now we rollin'"

Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
""Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?""
(June, you're a genius)

I said, ""I respect it, no problem""

I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway

Know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, my hand's always open, for real



Ayy

Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game

Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain

Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain

Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix

Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist

Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids

Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live

Brought a few Ws to the 6ix

Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is

Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit

Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit

Other times, I question if compliments are legit

Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch

Tryna make good on the promises that I give

Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit

Register the business in my brother's name

Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things

Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland

Always move right so my watch is on the other hand

She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan

People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand

My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands

Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans

Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can

I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands

I decide what to see next like it's on demand

I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans

I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman

I will split heads and break necks for my little man

6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man

But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man

Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?

Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?

Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'

How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?

How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?

How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?

How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again

How you got a manager you met after you got the win?

Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end

Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends

Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then

You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been

Than when others should've been

Got a nigga starin' at the game like, ""Damn, coach, put him in""

But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again

Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been

And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in

And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend

And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge

It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men

It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends

It's because you niggas never learn when to say when

Yeah



For real

Facts, you know what I'm sayin'?

Hahaha, yeah"

This song I've been writing, oh, for a few months
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)



Yeah

Yeah

Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that

I was here when you was asking where the love at

Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back

I was wishin' on a star when I was that

I've been fortunate enough to have it my way

I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say

'Member when we used to park up in my driveway

I always told it how it was, I never shy away

This life is really something you get lost in

I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends

I had friends that only had half of they heart in

It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then

But I treated you like gold, I was all in

Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in

Burnin' incense in your new apartment

But you got no sense when it come to

Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that

How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?

I'll be better off without you, and we know that

You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back

Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap

You sold me up the river, but I rowed back

You put me on the road without a roadmap

I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts



You got some liquor at the house?

Yeah

Go get a shot, let's do a shot together

I don't see it

Okay, hahaha



Ayy

Being here wasn't in the plans

I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram

I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam

I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am

Even when being real is out of fashion

Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'

I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting

I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen

Lost you to the game, I gotta face that

Really think I lost you like a ways back

Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair

I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there

You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair

We started this from the bottom, now you alone there

Shit, you treat it like it's home there

Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share

I still love you to my last days

I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced

I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case

I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face

It could've went left on a couple bad days

When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place

See me these days, I never got on a sad face

See me these days, I

Lost you to the game, and I see why

It was always you and I without the T-Y

This is not one of them stories that got three sides

This is not one of them stories you could rewind

Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap

You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back

You wrote me off and then you never wrote back

I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts



Yes, sir

(Baby)

Hold on, hold on

(Let me tell you something about me)

(I really do know, I know who I wanna be)

Woo

Lord, I already passed on all that (Woo)

I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail

Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy

I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy

Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG

If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly

Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat

Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC

Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those

Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos

The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchy

Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy

Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries

Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy

I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats

Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less

I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress

'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts

Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa

Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza

Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings

You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action

Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings

The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'

Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz

Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas

OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers

Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla

And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga

Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up

As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time

To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side

Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside

4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside

Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside

Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside

Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names

Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting

Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name

Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

But I ain't finished though

It's been a minute though

And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris

Luckilly, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen

I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi

Shit I seen it, you just ain't inside

And I feel like lately I went from top 5 to remaining 5

My favourite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive

And they tryna bring us down me, Weezy and Stunna

We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer

And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass

Then I'll probably give her my number

Yeah, I throw my dollars up high

And they land on the stage, dance on

We got company coming over

Would it kill you to put some pants on

Dreams money can buy

They told me it's like a high, it wasn't a lie

Forgettin' who I was on the other side of

Young nigga switchin' up the program right now

Tryna put the power in my own hands right now

I'm about to ride through the old hood right now

Got too much pride for my own good right now

Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up

So I could fall through like old times and hit it up



I'm tired but I invited myself to hold on

Those nights when you need someone else call me over

You can be the one to take control call me over

When I get there, you already know, call me



Call on me, call on me

Call on me, Birmingham call on me, call on me

Call on me

Call on me, call on me

Call on me

Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me

I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me

I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives

And shit I set aside to make sure my people are gettin' by

Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil

You know it's real when your niggas will take the fall for you

All loyal so you keep egging me on

And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled

Last night I tried some raw oysters

Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit

That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit

That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written

That boy did it on purpose

That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you

You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after

And if I left shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper

No offense cause I don't know that nigga

I'm focused on makin' records and gettin' bigger

Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk

Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home

I heard they talkin' crazy, I was out of town

You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around

But when I'm here, not a sound

That'll make me snap, jot it down

Go in the booth and lay a body down

Know some Somalis that say we got it wallahi

Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby

And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll

Let that man live, they say ""Okay if you say so""

See whatever I say goes

I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco

No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though

I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow

We all do it for the art so I can never hate though

Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load

How the game turn into the Drake show?

Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?

They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action

And then you never notice they missin'

On some Hunger Games shit I would die for my district

Jennifer Lawrence you can really get it

I mean forreal, girl you know I had to do it for yah

You know I had to do it for yah

You know I had to

Oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end

So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off

This on some ""old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit
For my niggas, though
You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?

The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me

So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety

I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards

You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper

Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter

Yeah, that's cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga

Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just being frank with you

I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with you?

Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget

Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it

Damn, this shit could go on a tape

Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break

Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook

That's why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake

Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?

Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team

Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas

Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas

For real

Some nobody started feelin' himself

A couple somebodies started killin' themself

A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf

I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help

I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation

Bad press during the summer over allegations

I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money

That's why I ain't got time for a nigga who's time is comin'

A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement

And I'm the only nigga still known for the music

I swear, fuck them niggas this year

I made Forbes list, nigga

Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous

Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans

But if I stay in the shit, there's a bunch of corpses

And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans

Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings

Eat it like I'm seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's

Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Easy and Cocoa

This shit for Kareem, this shit for Jaevon

This shit for Julius, Milly Mill

Boy we do this shit for real

All them boys in my will

All them boys is my Wills

Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil

Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill

If anything happen to papi, might pop a nigga for real

Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase

But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates

My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race

It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe

Niggas treat me like I've been here for ten

Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again

I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryin' to win here again

A young nigga tryin' to win here again

Man, what's up?



Yeah

A young nigga tryin' to win here again

If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in

I got her drinkin' with your boy

I got her fucked up, shorty

Why you never come to where I stay?

Always hiding out in your New York condo

Why you never come to where I stay?

If anybody knows, girl you know, I know

Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?

Why are we rushing and forcing it, this isn't making sense

Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl

Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl

Let me at least show you my side of things, man

Aw man, aw man

Aw, man



Me and you are playing house, start thinking that I'm losing touch

Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up

When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is

Start to think I got to get it how I live

We too busy for a wedding or a kid

If I'm working then I know you working

Keep in touch with other women, cuz you make me nervous

I empower girls that don't deserve it

I don't mean to do that shit on purpose

It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is

The dream is over, I just get lost up in the 6



And you never come to where stay

You just rather stay up in your New York condo

You don't ever come to where stay

If anybody knows, girl you know, I know

Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?

You know how sticky these situation can get

You go up higher than me some days

You know what I think we could be some day

Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning

On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip

I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them

Drizzy still got some '06 in him

IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on

All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on

It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game

See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane

Pay yourself and owe yourself

Before you come to my city just know yourself

Know where you at

I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at

The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga



But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is

That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like

The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..

Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all

We went through errythang...

I remember you loved Jodeci

I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…



Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out

I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op

We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop

Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC

I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not

I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot

Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga

I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas

Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga

I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas

You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga

I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga

Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails

And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel

That five star in your city, they know where we at

I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga



Jodeci's back

You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back

I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none

The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga

(Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms)

Jodeci's back

Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back

I paint pictures and flip words

Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole)



Roof top, hoes turnt up

Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up

Wonder where she is, fuck could she be?

She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak

Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak

Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me

Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas

Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas

Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain

Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame

Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame

'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no

Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters

I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest

Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started

I'm artistic, you niggas is autistic, retarded

Started, hold your applause

Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?

David and Goliath, takin' on the giants

No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole

No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars

Tappin' into '94 Nas

Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre

Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy

Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours

Just to get their dollar signed

Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'

Trenchcoat flow, bottom line

To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine

Flow dumber than your projections

This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet

Your covers keep perplexin' me

Maybe it's too complex for me

But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?

'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less to me

You legends know that we rap

They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, ""Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?""
They said, ""Fucking right, they were the first to go""
It's nothing personal

It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though

They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up

With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore

They might have loved you before

But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you""

It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year

Tell me, who did I leave behind?

You think it got to me, I can just read your mind

You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now

I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit

No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit

No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss

And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit

Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun

They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come

I'm never scared, they never real, I never run

When all is said and done, more is always said than done

And I was told once, things will change

By a nigga named Tip when my deal came

Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange

Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names

Rochelle, Jordan

Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand

How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?

How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?

Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all

Remember how I used to feel at the start of it

And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale

And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it

Yeah, just lie to my ears

Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear

Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas

And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home



Tell me, who did I leave behind?

You think it got to me, I can just read your mind

You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now

Uh, but believe I remember it all



My mother is back to who she was years ago

It's like a new page me and her are beginning on

I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand

'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on

She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth

But I'd never break the promises I made to myself

And I would never make up names for myself

Then change the names that I just gave to myself

Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?""

I used to brag about it to my friends

And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat

And maybe that's all they do is just pretend

Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it

Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it

Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love

'Cause I thought it was all I needed

Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along

And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit

They trip off the amount of people that I brought along

But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit

Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids

I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live

I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did

Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home



Tell me, who did I leave behind?

You think it got to me, I can just read your mind

You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now

Uh, but believe I remember it all



Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?

But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel

Yeah, uh

'Cause those other men are practice

And this ain't no time for actin'

And this ain't no time for games

And this ain't no time for uncertainty

And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home

And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone

This is why I've been saying

No new friends, no, no, no

You know how this shit goes

This is not four years ago

Time escapes me

Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow

I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home

All my young boys 'round me saying, ""Get money and fuck these hoes""

Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you

I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening

I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself

I need someone I leave through the front door with

'Cause we don't wanna hide no more

Plus you're not shy no more

Neither of us wanna play the side no more

No, I'm not alone

Even though nothing was the same

Let me get your ass alone

Let me make you say my name

Say my name



Say my name, say my name

When no one is around you

Say, ""Baby, I love you""

If you ain't running games

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta

Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what's up witcha?

I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it

I took some sense and made a nickel of it

I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers

With those lips that all that lipstick covers

You're never too grown up to miss and hug her

And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers

I'm on some Marvin Gay shit, a bunch of distant lovers

This ain't the life that I'm used to

Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to

Did you forget me?

Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me

And fear that I won't remember, I wish you could still accept me for me

I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad

The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have

I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags

Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Bad

In one nigga, amazing shit

I got that Courtney Love for ya, that crazy shit

I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit

And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit

Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains

The seats for these Heat games

I really think you stare at yourself and you see things

La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed

To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit

Fuck is up?

Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices

23 and goin' through a midlife crisis

But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife

And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it

Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach

To be far from hood, but to understand the streets

I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech

Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach

Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it

Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment

And, baby, I'll never forget none of that

Missing out on my years

It's time when I wish I was where I was

Back when I used to wish I was here

Missing out on my days

Scrolling through life and fishing for praise

Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways

I'm tryna see who's there on the other end of the shade

Most times it's just somebody that's underage

That's probably just alone and afraid

And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain

I always hear people complain about the place that they live

That all the people here fake and they got nothin' to give

'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit

That makes another city seem more exciting than it is

I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome

Then she finally got to Rome

And all she did was post pictures for people at home

'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known

I know another girl that's cryin' out for help

But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""

I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone

I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown

To post later and make it look like she still on the go

Look at the way we live

I wasn't hiding my kid from the world

I was hiding the world from my kid

From empty souls who just wake up and looked to debate

Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate

Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs

The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call

They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""

You know a wise man once said nothin' at all

I'm exhausted and drained I can't even pretend

All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch

All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end

I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

If they come to Hidden Hills then I know they know the deal

I be out here on my own, I'm just tryna set the tone

I've been kicked when I was down, none of that shit matter now

Niggas think they run the town 'til we run 'em out of town

And they gotta relocate, gotta defend where they stay

Everything will be okay, man just stay up out my way



Skit around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes

If I touch studio then we got one

I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know

But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one

Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold

Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from

I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke



Ayo blast that shit back-

Blast that shit back if you blastin'

Yeah, yeah



Back and forth to Italy, my comment section killin' me

I swear I get so passionate, y'all do not know the half of it

I grew up with the reps, them boys be crashin' it and splashin' in

And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident

I'm- I'm still in the studio at 6:45

And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived

And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride

You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside

I've been kicked when I was down, none of that shit matter now

They be throwin' in the towel, I do yellowtail Ital

They be watchin' what they say, especially when it's to my face

No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh
Yeah

Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from

Price tags on making the world feel some

They don't have enough to satisfy a real one

Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done

Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us

Louisville hush money for my young gunners

Rick Pitino, I take them to strip clubs and casinos

Stack of c-notes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo

Worms, I just opened up a can of those

My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's Rose

Two girls that I rope like I'm Indiana Jones

I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose

Yeah, fuck that I got to up the ante

California girls sweeter than pieces of candy

Had me all up on a Nipsey hood and go link up with Sammy

Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family

Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble

Life too short I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle

My uncle tried to change the energy with stones and crystals

But it's gonna take more than that for me to control my issues

I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell

Every title doing numbers like I'm Miss Adele

Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell

I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves



No more, no more

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah

No more, no more

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh



Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these

Crime family like the Genovese

You don't want drama, capisce?

My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid

I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief

I find it funny how I keep on talking and commas increase

I'm standing at the top of where you niggas are climbing to reach

I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets

Subtle reminders are key, Gs

Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic

And everyone that wants the worst for me's asking what happened

Backstabbed so many times I started walking backwards

Like Charlemagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches

Bury me and I'll be born again

I walk in godly form amongst the mortal man

I got some real demons across the border fence

And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again

Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird

Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doing dirty work

Hit 'em back and say we'll link back on the 33rd

When I say that they cursing me, it ain't dirty words

Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue

I don't know who's protecting me but we hit it off

Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna' pick me off

I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (yeah)

Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax

My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts

This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats

Based off of that, they gotta run me the max

They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks

They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps

When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that

If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back

I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt

You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map

Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent

I promise it fell in my lap

My money is young, my problems are old

I promise I'm bridgin' the gap

First album 26, I ain't need no deal (real)

Already a hood legend, I ain't need no Shyne (woo!)

First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah

Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments

Dope boys, Off-White, lookin' like soft white on 'em

Heh, you know what I'm sayin'?

We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'

Live every word that I'm rappin'

Say I lost 90 bricks and it happened

You probably wouldn't believe

Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action

I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am

God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?

I'm what Meech shoulda been

I'm what Supreme didn't become

Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it

Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses

Only rest that I do is ""Where the rest of my commas""

Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes

When life comin' at you from all angles and sides

And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside

It really boils down to how you plan to survive

Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em

Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?

Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom

And they recognize the bathroom

All hell starts to break loose in my texts

I only tell lies to who I gotta protect

I would rather have you remember me how we met

I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect

But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step

That ain't what I'm 'bout

I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt

If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without

They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without

Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house

My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the south



Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?

Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?

Is there more? Yeah



Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice

The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap in the truth

Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot

Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs

I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?

I'll let you bring a thousand recruits

My peers are a talented group

But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two

Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops

There's still nothin' they could really do

It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due

Whenever it's time to recoup

Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal

In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?""

I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die

What you got? Time on your hands or time on your side?

Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?

Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?

Yachts on 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies

Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties

And all of these fortunate times

And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?

Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?

Like healin' my soul, like family time



Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?

Is there more?



Passion, instant

Sweat beads, feel me (feel me)

Cupid's shot me

My heartbeat's racing (my heartbeat's racing)

Tempt me, drive me (tempt me)

Feels so exciting

Thought of highly (highly)

It's yours entirely

I'll be, I'll be more than a lover

More than a woman

More than your lover for you"

Late night, like left eye

I’m creepin’, assuming the worst ‘cause I haven’t heard from you all weekend

Your silence is driving me up the wall, up the wall

I cannot tell if you’re ducking calls or missing calls ‘cause

You’ve been so patient

I drink on the job and smoke on the job

So I don’t know how serious you take it

Can’t offer much more, you’ve heard it before

I wanna make you a priority

I wanna let you know there’s more to me

I wanna have your faith restored in me

Put your feet in this water, don’t wanna get your hair wet

We’ve hooked up a couple times, we ain’t took it there yet

You broke up with your man and ain’t been with nobody else

You like, “Fuck these niggas,” rather keep it to yourself

He did you wrong, he left you down bad

Now you can’t trust nobody

You said, “Do anything, but just don’t lie to me”

I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me

Umm, pulled up to the shorty, we got drugs

And when it’s time to duck it, we can go

Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed

She not my lover like Billie Jean but the kid is mine

Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time, and all it took was one time

Shit, we only met two times, two times

And both times were nothing like the new times

Now it's rough times

I'm out here on front lines just trying to make sure that I see him sometimes

It's breaking my spirit

Single father, I hate when I hear it

I used to challenge my parents on every album

Now I'm embarrassed to tell them I ended up as a co-parent

Always promised the family unit

I wanted it to be different because I've been through it

But this is the harsh truth now

Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now

I don't want you worry about whose house you live at

Or who loves you more, or who's not there

Who did what to who 'fore you got here

Now, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now

Realize I got to think for two now, I gotta make it, I better make it

I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated

This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated

I can't forget the looks on they faces

Got the news in Miami that we all now got ones that we raisin'

Tell Gelo bring some, uh, Rosé and Baccarat out for our cheers to the next generation

But this champagne toast is short-lived

I got an empty crib in my empty crib

I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick

I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts

Your mother say you growing so fast that they don't even really fit

But man, you know, I still had to get it for my boy though, you know

You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip

He probably coulda did stand-up

But at the same time he's a stand up

And that's how you gonna be when it's time to man up

October baby for irony sake, of course

I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours

And believe me, I can't wait to get a hunnid more

Sorry I'm vintage, tryna cover ground

They said that in two weeks you're supposed to come in town

Hopefully by the time you hear this me and your mother will have come around instead of always cutting each other down



God willing, I got a good feeling

You got a good spirit

We'll talk more when you hear this

It's a joke, but you say you real

I don't understand

On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs

We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls

Swear to god, shout to Buffalo

Never ducking low

I don't stop, man I'm stuck on go

Always hug the row, fuck a opp

Make his body roll, yeah a lot of those

Started out doing college shows, Calipari flow

Then I popped like you never seen

We were everything

I went off in the '16, give me '17



Want a lot, can't have everything

Can't have everything

Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything



Bad attitude, telling who to calm down

Tryna' cool it all down

Who's calling my name, who's involved now

Tell me who I gotta down

I do a song now, man even though there's way less to prove to you now

Man, everything went around is comin' back around

Y'all better hit the ground, god damn

Be forever unfinished

Yeah, it's opened, in't it?

Had me all for a minute

Had you all since beginning

Damn, I must be coaching 'cause I'm not playin' with them

Can you not see the difference?

I mean, I keep the fucking lights on in the building

Man, my record deal should be 500 million, god damn



Can't have everything, can't have everything

Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything



Finally got my mind in a free state

Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak

I gave them back a clean plate

Same niggas pree-ing cause they hate to see the team straight

Same niggas beaking always ducking my release date

That's when the phone starts ringing like a wingstraight

Two faced nigga back around with the three face damn

Oh, triple double, Russ face

Watch with the bust face

Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face

Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face

Y'all fucking hilarious

Y'all really think you niggas teamin' up and scaring us

Y'all niggas is arrogant

Y'all sleep at the Sheraton

All that shit embarrassing

Tell your big homie I'm all for going there again

He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance

All that's in my account at the Bank Of America

All that Drake hysteria

Six side, east side, all that for my area



You know hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days

I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel

As well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust

But that attitude will just hold you back in this life

And you will continue to feel alienated

Give some thought to this because I'm confident in you

And I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals

Much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days

When others go low, we go high"

'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

I still have my guard up

Blame this thing I'm part of

Trying to avoid more confrontation

I just gotta try harder

Taking the time to clear my mind 'cause

Soon as I'm able to let that go



Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

We love y'all too!

We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life

You need devotion

Saturday to Saturday

You see that I've been going through it

Hoping everything's okay

I just want to let you know

Everything these days is textual

I just want to get a little sexual, with you

Because I remember way, way, back

With the waves under the wavecap

You were someone else's wife in fact

You didn't even look at me like that

Then it all just switched, over time

Gotta let me know something

Wonder how you've been

I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was

These streets got so familiar

Malibu coast where I meditate

Book a plane home then I hesitate

Scared to see what I left behind

It's weighing heavy on my mind and

I can't help but wonder how you've been baby

What are you on?

Gotta let me know something

Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes

I don't want to have to go to funerals

I gotta start sleepin' at the studio

I don't have no time to be no Romeo

All the love I need is at the rodeo

All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah

All the girls I know are there with Ian Throw

Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?

Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes

Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on a rotary phone

I take a glass, it don't mean, ""Nah, don't go with me home.""

Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome

I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on

Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves

I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views

Saw a side of myself that I just never knew

I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do

Steady doin' double shifts

1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click

More blessings because I'm generous

Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us

Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet

She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it

Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it

Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it

Scary whenever I close my eyes at night

Wakin' up to public statements about my private life

I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights

But you can rest assure that my mind is right

Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days

Never stick around to see shit change

Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'

Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'

Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV

To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'

I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this

Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense

Especially people that want to lecture me, and frame it like they just want the best for me

Or they check for me, whatever splits it up

So there's more for them and there's less for me

They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me

No one's done it successfully

7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me

Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery

Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me

That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency

Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally

Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly

If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me

You overnight celebrity, you one day star

Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity

I am a reflection of all of your insecurities

Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping

Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me

There's real ones around me

I want to make sure they learn from me

I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety

He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency

My life is set around competition and currency

Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery

Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me

I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary

Guess that's what they say you need family for

Cause I can't depend on you anymore



Always saw you for what you could've been

Ever since you met me

Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley

I always saw you for what you could've been

And even when it's business with you it's personal again

I knew you before you made ends meet now we're meeting our ends



And its all because you chose a side

You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me

Guess it wasn't time

And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine



You're so predictable I hate people like you

Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you

How you supposed to figure what I'm going through

You can't even figure out what's going on with you

You judge 'fore you met me yeah it figures

I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas

With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong

Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on

I don't know what's going on



And its all because you chose a side

You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me

Guess it wasn't time

And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine



You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align

My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right

When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice

But you always had something to say every other time

Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way

I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage

Someone up there must just love testing my patience

Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment

Forgiveness for your ways

If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised

Same way I'm right here still feeling the wave

Same way I'm realizing on a day to day



All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore

How do you not check on me when things go wrong

Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer

Much closer

All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore

Guess that's what they say you need family for

Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Much closer



Anytime people want to start problems

For real are you done

You know who mans are

I'm not afraid no gyal heart man

And I'm not afraid of no catty

And I'm not afraid of no waste neither

So anybody who want it can get it

Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it

He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement

He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment

Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission

We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him

Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know

Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show

I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those

I mean you boys not even coming close

I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration

You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places

Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear

Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care

No tender love and care and no love and affection

I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it

I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson

Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together

Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester

40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure

A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded

A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation

Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day

You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday

You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'

You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless

You get the message over and over like it was urgent

And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person

The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in

And did it with a purpose

Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships

Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension

A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned

Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention

It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder

The most successful rapper 35 and under

I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under

That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded

Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin

She violated, I sent her back where it all started

How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment

Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness

Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east

Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite

Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free

I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me

You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique

Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats

I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat

Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE

The best ever, don't ever question, you know better

But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together

Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it

Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled

Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal

Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement

To talk loosely, I really do this

Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit

Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it

Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it

To busy face screwin' on waste movements

You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'

First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it

And they still take to it

Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid

And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it

But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful

But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want

Get high when I want

Yeah, that's right

Yeah"

Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?

Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?

I don't want you here with someone else

I don't wanna do this with no one else

I used to know you back when you was young

Your brother brought me through, you saw me

That made me think of you so differently

I miss the feeling of you missing me

Act like he's really the one to get through it with you

Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women

I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it

Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision

Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment

Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me

That mean a lot to me

Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me

This year for Christmas I just want apologies

Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'

Syd had a baby and treated me different

Erica sued me and opened a business

Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different

Wonder what they'd do put in my position

I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?

Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions

I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven

Tryna satisfy everybody

It's like they can't get enough

Until enough is enough

And that is too much

You tip the scale when I weigh my options

West Palm girls are spoiled rotten

Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'

I'll kill somebody if they give you problems

Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'

Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet

I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit

Sell my secrets and get top dollar

Sell my secrets for a Range Rover

Opportunity and temptation

They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation

Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'

Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?

Since take care, I've been caretakin'

At second chances, that ain't how you livin'

Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven



Yeah

I know"

But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it

I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort

But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together

Yeah, not here to fight wars

But niggas wanna talk high scores

PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche

And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were to die for

But I got bigger fish to fry

I'm talking bigger shit than you and I

Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine

And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified

Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night

Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement

I just got me the Mercedes Pullman

You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google

Back in the city, shit is getting brutal

These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies

They've been dropping out on both sides

We ain't in it, we just ghost ride

The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines

I thought you wanted yours like I want mine

I guess you just making moves on your own time

But just know it'll be January in no time

And your absence is very concerning

It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning

Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30

Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey

I got a club in the Raptors arena

Championships, celebrations during regular seasons

Paternity testing for women that I never slept with

I'm legally obligated if they request it

So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson

Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction

Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting

Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum

I just listened to Closer To My Dreams

Wide eyed and uneducated at 19

I can't rap like that, all young and naive

Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe

Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience

I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it

4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious

You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it

I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways

Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away

Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start

And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing

Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion

Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming

They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden

Now you the one getting buckets

They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches

Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to

And women that you seen on TV look better in person

And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes from there

But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action

The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually

What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?

Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?

We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?

Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?

My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf

And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves

Papi champú, young pablito de sies dios

6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I

And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?

Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena

But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know"

Shout out to the G's from the ends

We don't love no girls from the ends

I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again

I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog

It's just apparent every year

Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror

Lookin' at myself like, there it is there

Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo

I ain't tryna chance it

I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State

Or Grambling

Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'

Watch the way I handle it, uh

Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit

She know I'm the man with it, uh

With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton

I ain't playin' with it

Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then

Make sure the plane got a phone now

You gotta remind 'em about where you been

About all of the money that done came and went

About the two cents I ain't never spent

When they say you're too famous to pack a gat

I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from

Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone

Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone

Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone

Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones

Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns

Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron

Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6

Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry

You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry

I was only five but still remember the drought in '87

Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em

I ain't got no time

Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence

I'm fuckin' her mind

I got, mind control over Deebo

Parmesan my panino

Promethazine over Pinot

And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch



I ain't felt the pressure in a little while

It's gonna take some getting used to

This is nothin' for the radio,

but they'll still play it though

Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake,

that's just the way it go

Heavy airplay all day with no chorus

We keep it thorough, nigga,

rap like this for all of my borough niggas

I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga

I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga

Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga

I could go a hour on this beat, nigga

I'm just as famous as my mentor

But that's still the boss, don't get sent for

Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for

Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more

Hot temper, scary outcome

That always let they mouth run

Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it

Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit

Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup



Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV

Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me

Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me

I'll compromise if I have to,

I gotta stay with the family

Not even talkin' to Nicki,

communication is breakin'

I dropped the ball on some personal shit,

I need to embrace it

I'm honest, I make mistakes,

I'd be the second to admit it

Think that's why I need her in my life,

to check me when I'm trippin'

On a mission tryna shift the culture

Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit

Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'

All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments

Fuck what you think, I'm too busy,

that's why you leave a message

Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive

That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure

Like aye, B I got your CD,

you get an E for effort

I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless

I don't change like credentials,

you know you see the necklace

My life's a completed checklist

I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now

Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now

That's real



How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento

I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo

The family all that matters,

I'm just out here with my kinfolk

Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow

This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo

I sip the [?] and listen to Cappadonna

The Fresh Prince just had dinner with Tatiana, no lie

All these 90's fantasies on my mind

The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time

I might come through without security to check if you're fine

That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO

Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""

You don't have to prove shit to know and except yourself

And if you end up needing some extra help, then I can help

You know, back on your feet and shit

Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?

Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese

And I wouldn't change a thing if you payed me, now real nigga wassup 

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?



If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there.

Are you enjoyin' yourselves?

If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational.

Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears,

shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years.

It don't mean that we can't have a good life.

Niggas talk more than bitches these days

Who could get the pussy quicker these days

Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days

Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days

Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story

My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry""

Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury

Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'

But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money

Y'all don't even really check for me

You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl

You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl

Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call

When the last time you did somethin' for the first time? You done done it all

I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days

Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days

Broken telephone for every single conversation

Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores

You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop

Whose jewels got rocks,

Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop

Same old pimp,

Drake you know ain't nothing's changed with these funny style niggas

We done put out of the game

I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave

And its back to L.A.,

Open the mail, staring at the check

Enough to make you throw up

Man it's gross what I net

I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib

I swear I could be Serena when she playing with her left

Oh, where I reside it looks like a resort inside

Nigga, where your shit from?

I imported mine

Bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh

Fuck you bitch, I'm on that high

My momma probably hear that and be mortified

This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura

5 a.m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside

For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized

Yeah, back and forth across the border line

Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime

Gone all the time, even the important times

I should let you know ahead of time I'm coming back on my worst behavior

With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us

That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us

So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?

Darling you, you give but you cannot take love





I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive

Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance

I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping

I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different

Started realizing a couple places I could take it

I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement

I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation

And influence a generation that's lacking in patience

I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience

Just me and my old man getting back to basics

We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted

When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing

Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas

We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us

We even talked about you and our couple of moments

He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups

You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone

Looking like you came from the 70's on your own

My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is

Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?

You don't even know what you want from love anymore

I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored

But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?

Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?



I love me, I love me enough for the both of us

That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us

So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?

Darling you, you give but you cannot take love



Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures

Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage

When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit

A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it

Cause that night I played her three songs

Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on

Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz

Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off

Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria

Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria

Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music

When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it

The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree

I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me

Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?

Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't

Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz

Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision

Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions

When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven

It seem like you don't want this love anymore

I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore

But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?

Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?



I love me, I love me enough for the both of us

That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us

She just wanna run around the city and make memories

That she can barely remember

And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power

She just wanna run over my feelings

Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler

And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power

She used to say: ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""

Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself

But when it falls apart, I'm always still down

To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground

Wish you would learn to love people and use things

And not the other way around

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is

She call and tell me be here before the sun up

I be dressed before we hung up

I take Eglinton to 401 east

And exit at Markham road in the east end

Where all the pretty girls are sleeping

My license been expired I renew it after the weekend

Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends

Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness

I hate stoppin' for gas this late

Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'

Summer is comin' know you could feel it

20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it

Won't knock on your door

My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours""

I got the pedal to the floor

I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'



Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there

It could all be so simple

Talkin' that shit with your back to me

Just know it always get back to me

And she way too attached to me

Hate when they get too attached to me

I got to get on the bus and get back on the road

Get what I can out the country

And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold

Can't even drive with the top off

I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer

I just might bring in some girls from Miami

Stuck in the house, need to get out more

I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising

Most people in my position get complacent

Wanna come places with star girls, end up on them front pages

I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it

Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it

I'm the only one that's putting shots up

And like a potluck, you need to come with it

Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100

I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it

Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?

Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?""

These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there

Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out

Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out

And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit

Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit

Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear

Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here

Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself

That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit

And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now

Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now

Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down

I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on

But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on

Someone put a order in for a chicken

Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen

Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up

Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?

Rap game, Crack game, ain't that different ya know?

Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?

And ya know I need ya back in my life

Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like

Girl you got that thing forreal

Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?

Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?

[Intro]
I'm really stepping up my game
These b-tches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy



[Hook: Drake]

Got everything, I got everything

I cannot complain, I cannot

I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot

It's a lot, f-ck that, nevermind what I got

Nigga don't watch that cause I

Came up, that's all me

Stay true, that's all me

No help, that's all me

All me forreal

Came up, that's all me

Stay true, that's all me

No help, that's all me

All me forreal



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]

Money on my mind, you should think the same

J's on, pinky ring

Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine

In the same league, but we don't ball the same

She want all the fame

I hear that sh-t all the time

She said she love me

I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line,"" ok

Made a million, off of denim

F-ck, watch me switch it up

Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""

You need that work, I got that work, got b-tches in my condo

Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note

From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off

And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off

This that sauce, this that dressing

Givenchy, nigga God bless you

If having a bad b-tch was a crime

I'd be arrested (True)



[Hook]



[Verse 2: Drake]

I touched down at '86

Knew I was a man by the age of 6

I even f-cked girls that used to babysit

But thats was years later on some crazy sh-t

I heard your new sh-t, nigga hated it

Damon Wayans told me dont play that sh-t

I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit

And my latest sh-t is like a greatest hits

God damn

Ain't no wishing over on this side

Y'all don't f-ck wit' us and we don't f-ck wit' y'all, it's no different over on this side

God damn

Should I listen to everybody or myself?

Cause myself just told myself, ""You the motherf-ckin' man, you don't need no help""

Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,

Ya'll keep talking bout who next,

But I'm about how big as it gets,

I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,

I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,

I'mma make it last forever,

It's not your turn cause I ain't done yet,

Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,

I was made for all of this sh-t,

And I'm on the road box office sales,

I'm getting paid for all of this sh-t,

Ask you to please excuse my table manners,

I was making room for the table dancers,

Cause if we judging off your advances,

I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!



[Hook]



[Verse 3: Big Sean]

HOE, SHUT THE F-CK UP

I got way too much on my mental

I learn from what I've been through

I'm finna do what I didn't do

And still waking up like the rest do

Not complicated, it's simple

I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full

And to them hoes I'm everythang

Everything but gentle

But I still take my time

Man I guess I'm just old fashioned

Wearing retro sh-t, that's old fashioned

Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption

I paint pics, see the sh-t

Good sex, need to hit

Keep a bra on the floor

Year round like season tickets

I plead the fifth

Drink a fifth

Load the nine

Leave you split, in the half

Smoke a half, needles it

My new girl is on Glee and sh-t

Probably making more money than me and sh-t

I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a b-tch ain't one

I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one

Like I got trust issues

I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out

I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom

And still gotta pull out

But that's just me

And I ain't perfect

I ain't a saint but I am worth it

If it's one thing, I am worth it

Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'

Lil' b-tch



[Drake]

All Me. All Me. Oh my. I think I done f-cked too many women from the 305 Before the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,

Smoking all that kush all in our section like its legalized

Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that

They dont really f-ck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that

I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that

I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back

And I need that sh-t right back (no more free Randy)

I'm less than a motherf-cker,

Niggas been stressed than a motherf-cker

Niggas gettin' nervous, touching they chests like a motherf-cker,

Damn that's a motherf-cker

Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,

Cause I don't like being lied to

And that ship won't sail,

And that wind won't guide you

Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,

Like a motherf-cking drive-thru

That was back then man,

Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do"

It's not me it's you
The records say you know it they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on well I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion oh-oh I guess that's just the motion oh-oh
I guess that's just the motion oh-oh

I guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion



I don't have a fuck to give

I've been moving state to state

In my leather and my tims like its 1998

And my dog chubby chub, that's my nigga from the way

On the east side of the city that's where everybody stay

Seem like everybody calling cause they want me on they song

It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong

When they need a favor from your man they don't leave you alone

But I guess that's just the motion

Then that phone doesn't ring when they got everything that's the motion oh-oh

I guess that's just the motion oh-oh

I guess that's just the motion yeah



Lookin back on it at least my pride is intact

Cause we said no strings attached and I still got tied up in that

Everything that I write is either for her or about her

So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it

The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health

Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else

I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself

Don't even know how to help

But I guess that's just the motion

She'll probably come around, soon as I settle down,

That's the motion oh-oh

I guess that's just the motion (9x)"

Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself ""why do you hurt me? ""
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you love me baby
Time to take you away from me

Only over my dead body...



I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man

Fuck it I was on though

And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club

Fuck it I was wrong though

Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free

Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me

Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some

Long as the outcome is income

You know I want it all and then some

Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum

Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from

Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from

Yeah, you know me well nigga

I mean you ain't the only real nigga

They got me on these white women like Seal nigga

Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga

Are these people discussing my career again?

Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again

Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?

Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?

Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying

And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine

And I be hearing shit you say through the grapevine

But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time

It's been that way from the beginning

I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning

And this is the only sound you should fear

Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright



I know, I know that you love me baby

The time to take you away from me

Only over my dead body



You say I'm old news, where who the new star?

Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far

Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states

Used half of the money to beat my brother's case

Red wine over Fed time

And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime

Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime

And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time

Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy

You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy

Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy?

Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy

Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better

I think maybe I was numb to it last year

But you know I feel it now more than ever

My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay

Second album, I'm back paving the way

The backpackers are back on the bandwagon

Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day

And I met your baby moms last night

We took a picture together - I hope she frames it!

And I was drinking at the Palms last night

And ended up losing everything that I came with

Feel like I've been here before huh?

I still got 10 years to go huh?

This is the only sound you should fear

These kids wear crowns over here

And everything is all right



I know, I know that you love me baby

The time to take you away from me

Only over my dead body"

Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you

It's a shame you didn't keep it: Alicia, Katia

I know that you gon hear this: I'm the man

Yeah I said it! Bitch I'm the man

Don't you forget it

The way you walk, that's me

The way you talk, that's me

The way you've got your hair up: did you forget that's me?

And the voice in your speaker right now: that's me

And the voice in your ear: that's me

Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it

First I made you who you are, then I made it

And you're wasted with your ladies

Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded



Take a shot for me, ooooh

Take a shot for me, ooooh

Take a shot for me

A shot for me

A shot for me



Ok look: I'm honest

Girl I can't lie: I miss you

You and the music were the only things that I commit to

I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you

But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you

She says I know you changed, I never see you

Cause you're always busy doing things

I really wish had a different way of viewing things

I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things

It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen

The men are jealous and the women all in competition

And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret

And taint all your images of your ""Mr. Perfect""

I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer

Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover

This is one I know you hated when you heard it

And it's worse because you know that I deserve it...



Take a shot for me, ooooh

Take a shot for me, ooooh

Take a shot for me

Trouble neglect you, angels protect you

I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that

I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that

And they want to see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at?

I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that

Stuff my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin like that

You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that

You gonna make someone around me catch a body like that

No, don't do it, please don't do it

Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind

Then she wanna ask when it got so empty

Tell her I apologize, happened over time

She says she miss the old Drake, girl don't tempt me

If they don't get it, they'll be over you

That new shit that you got is overdue

You better do what you supposed to do

I'm like ""why I gotta be all that?"" but still I can't deny the fact

That it's true, listening to you expressing all them feelings

Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like ""All My Children""

And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing

I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions

You know that they ain't even got it like that

You gonna hype me up and make me catch your body like that

Fake ID's and the trash we going straight to the top

Smoking weed on the star projectors

I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us

But seeing my family have it all

Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

And really, I think I like who I'm becoming

There's times where I might just do it just to do it

Like it's nothing

There's times when I might blow 50k on a vacation

For all my souljas just to see the looks on all they faces

All it took was patience

I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me

The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me

The realest niggas say ""your lyrics do shit for me""

I told my story, it made history

Tell em I need reservations for 20

I've never really been one for the preservation of money

Nah, much rather spend it all while I'm breathing

One time, been in love one time

You and all your girls in the club one time

All so convinced that you're following your heart

Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes

We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed

I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know

We know, You hate being alone

You ain't the only one

You hate the fact that you bought the dream

And they sold you one

I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling hands
I was dope when I said the music business was all I needed

When I got it I was greeted by an alien

That said last year that she slept with a canadian

That gave him an addiction

That would keep him in Mercedes Benz

Bright lights and Rhianna as a lady friend

My vice is similar women love when your my type

And you win it from everything that your palm write

Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city

Devil in a dress, Platinum Channel

Live the ambiance all cause the audiance

One day said I would do it

So instead of a verse being read

I'm a go 'n get some head off the strength of my music

I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat

Capitalize That, and you weave look good

With the indian tracks

Tracking device on your used 5 series

I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian

The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto

Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word

Like the rappers I know

Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us

A white waitress on standby when we need her

A black maybach 40 pulled up G

No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah

Felt like the initiation

A reality living in the matrix

We talk casualy about the industry

And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin'

Then he said that he was the same age as myself

And it didn't help cause it made me even more rude and impatient

So blame it on mr OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing on the vanity I know

The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life

But I live a double life and need to let her go

The reason was the highlight was when he said

You alone to the people till you outside

So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame

And bury yourself alive, then I died"

And rappin' rappin' an' bitches until all of us switches

I swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who I was

I'm the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was

That's what's important and what happened before this

When me and my crew as all about this rapper from New Orleans

Singing ""walking like a man, finger on the trigger

I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah""

With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves

I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve

I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things

Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king

I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told

Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance

Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance

Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good

Do me like the women from my town would

Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors

Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for

Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back

And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack

And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth

And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south

And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like

So why am I a classic, this is who I'm trying to be like

So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade

As soon I realize that term-end papers they won't get me paid

If I don't nothing I'm a ball

I'm countin all day like a clock on the wall

Yeah need that, making major changes to the life I'm living

I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions

That was back in the days, Acura days

I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things

Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king

I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told

Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll

And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it

Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it

Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it

Nigga, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)"

But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans, but neither was making it and here I am
In the presidential do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon, she deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it

That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street

Got a new condo, move it to the beach

Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib

Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord)

Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming

Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing



The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?

Well fuck let's get it then



I'm trying to let go of the past

Should we make this one a double?

You ain't even gotta ask, Ahh

Because it's hard to say no, say no

Yeah it's hard to say no



Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime

Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine

Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime

Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine



Used to make us proud we had dreams of getting bigger man

Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga man

You keep talking that, ""you was this and you had this

And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it""

Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line

And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time

You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now

I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now

Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?

Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?

I heard you got your ways, I never would have known

She said, ""you're such a dog"", I said, ""you're such a bone.""

I've been everywhere, where you know me from?

These days women give it to me like they owe me one

But they crave attention though they always saying, ""show me some""

But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one

At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that

Then fuck let's get it then



I'm trying to let go of the past

Should we make this one a double?

You ain't even gotta ask, Ahh

Yeah it's hard to say no

Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine

Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime

Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine



Yeah! Drizzy, yo turn nigga!

Take Care of the business nigga (shine on these niggas)

Give these niggas the business nigga!

Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck em, we don't love em!

Yeah, it's just that Uptown gangsta shit

Toronto, stand up for one of the realest Niggas

Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?

I like a woman with a future and a past
A lil attitude problem all good, it'll make shit last
Don't make it too easy girl, don't take it too fast

Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that

Only you can do it just like that

And I love it when your hair still wet cause you just took a shower

Running on a treadmill and only eating salad

Sound so smart like you graduated college

Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard

Knowing you, weekend in Miami tryna study by the pool

Couple things due but you always get it done

Might have been a time when I loved her too

But you take that away and you'll always be the one

One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl

Maybe it's just right for the night

You said niggas coming on too strong girl

They want you in their life as a wife

That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest

Why you wana fight for your right

Cause you don't love them boys

Pussy run everything, fuck that noise



[Chorus: Drake]

I know things get hard but girl you got it girl

You got it, there you go

Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go

Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine

When all these muthaf-ckas wanna waste your time

It's just amazing girl, and all I can say is

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you



Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back

That's why you're bad as fuck and you...



[Nicki Minaj:]

B-b-b-bet I am

All of them bitches I'm better then

Mansions in Malibu babblin

But I never mention everything I dabble in

And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'

And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in

Gotta ro-ro-row, gotta row ya boat

It's Pink Friday records and OVO

Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest deal

Best legal team so the deals is I'll

It's Mac, OPI and a fragrance too

Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue

Cobblestone, good view, lil gravel too

Gotta pay for the entourage travel too

Cause I'm fli-fli-fly, I'm flying high

Ain't got time to talk, just Hi and bye



Baby you can ask me to take a break

I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say

I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

I'm a star, Sheriff badge,

[Verse 1: Drake]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here

And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?

So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom

And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all

But that's just the result of me paying attention

To all these women that think like men with the same intentions

Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention

Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention

But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models

Heffer and Jordan are my only role models

That's why I walk around with all this gold on

And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems

Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings

All of the little accents that make me a king

I never hear the disses they try and point out to me

But it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing

I'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about Christmas in August

Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters

Get some shake a brick in the press

And chef it like Mrs. Fields they're making the cookie stretch

I know it so well, I know the hustle so well

Stunt like I'm workin' overnighters right by the motel

Drug money outfit, record clean

Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team

Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real

Places they say they've been, we've actually going for real

I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin'

I'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy

Mixtape legend, underground kings

Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things

With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs

Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams

They take the greats from the past and compare us

I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era

In a time where it's recreation

To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations

I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at

Never the flow though, they know I run that

Fuck you all, I claim that whenever

I change rap forever, the game back together, yup

YM, I remain that forever

In the same place my brother Wayne at forever

I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix

I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished

I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me

I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy

Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy

So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me

Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up

Roll this and boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up

A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up

But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?

Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky

Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies

In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy

That's why all the real soldiers salute me

Trill nigga, for real



[Interlude: Rick Ross]

You know I love this

YOLO, you only live once

I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie

Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal



[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

I fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink

The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think

Still allergic to broke, prescription strength of the paper

Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica

Villa on the water with the wonderful views

Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews

Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise

And these niggas talkin like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes

It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar

Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car

Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R

Headlights flickin', lookin' like a fallin' star

Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae

I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game

Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate

Rosay and Drake, I'm gettin' cake, nothin' short of great"

It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you

That's the wrong thing to do

Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you

That's the wrong thing to do

Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you

That's the wrong thing to do

Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying

And say I love you too



But I need someone different

You know it, oh ho, you know it

Oh ho, you know it, we both know it

I need someone different

You know it, oh ho, you know it

Oh ho, you know it, we both know it

Something's been missing

You know it, oh ho, she knows it

Oh ho, I know it, we all know it

I need someone different

(Oh ho, oh ho)



We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together

But we sure make it feel like we're together

Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else



So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you

That's the wrong thing to do

Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you

That's the wrong thing to do

Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you

People around you should really have nothin' to say

And the weekends here started it right

Party tonight, party tonight

Dying to meet your girlfriends

That you said you might bring

If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

Just may already feel like I know the real her

You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind

You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find

You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you

If I ignore all that advice

Then something isn't right

Then who will I complain to?

But the weekends here started it right

Even if I only get part of it right

Party tonight, party tonight



You got your guards up, I do too. There's things we might discover

Cause you got a path and I do too, we're perfect for each other

Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another

So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover

And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover

I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder

About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it

I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different

Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass

I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last.

And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you 'cause those are deadly
And then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit

And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it

Now it's ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat""

And I leave out and you call me, tell me that your sorry

You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too

And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two

I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see, it all hurt so bad

But maybe I wouldn't have worked as hard

If you were healthy and it weren't so bad

Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank

Cause leave it up to me, J, and neeks, we're probably gonna end up robbing a bank

Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long

Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning

Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on

He's thinking of signing me, I come home

We make a mixtape with seventeen songs

I almost get a Grammy off of that thing

They love your son and that boy gone

You get the operation you dreamed of

And I finally send you to Rome

I get to make good on my promise

It all worked out girl, we shoulda known

Cause you deserve it

After all the things that we been through, I got you

Look what you've done for me now

It's like '06 in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade

And I'm still in love, just wasn't that real, so then it doesn't fade

And my father living in Memphis now he can't come this way

Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid

Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black american dad story

Know that I'm your sister's kid but

That still don't explain the love that you have for me

I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances

Damn your house feel like the Hamptons

For all of my summer romances

I never really had no one like you man this all new, She

Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it

Had all this fighting going on at the crib

You calm me down when I lose it

Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music

You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far

Talked to me, to you got to me you

You tossed the keys and loaned me your car

Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top

Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested

Just another kid goin' through life

So worried that I won't be accepted

But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that

You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back

Checks bounce but we bounce back

I put all the money in your accounts back

And I thank you, I don't where

I'd really be without that, it worked out man

You deserve it

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated

Admitted it to me the first time we dated

But she was no angel, and we never waited

I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck

So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it

And we never talk too much after I blew up

Just only hello' or happy belated'

And I think I text her and told her I made it

And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it

And that's when I text her and told her I love it

Then right after texting I told her I'm faded

She asked

What have I learned since getting richer

I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures

I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture

Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya

Damn, is it the fall

Time for me to revisit the past

It's women to call

There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved

There's stories to tell, we been through it all

Do you ever get nervous?

They say love is in the air, so I

Hold my breath until my face turn purple

Keep a few bad bitches in my circle

My nuts hang like ain't no curfew

Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you

I flew jet, she flew commercial

But we still met, later that night

After my session, she came over

I was aggressive, and she was sober

I gave her pills

She started confessing and started undressing

And ask me to hold her

And so I did, but that was last month

And now she's texting me, asking for closure

Damn

She say this shit gon' catch up to me

I keep tissue paper

We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table

She say she hate that she love me

And she wish I was average

Shit, sometimes I wish the same

And I wish she wasn't married

Promises, I hope I never break em

Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but

Interviews are like confessions

Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs

You see a girl and you ask about her

And steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image

And ride around in overpriced rental cars that aint tinted

You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights

The sun is up when you get home, thats just a way of life

Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings

When you record with 2 others that want the same things

Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels

And so you up there every night you swear you getting close

That champagne money was for gas and phone bills

But shit you bout to spend it on what matters most

You drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a nigga

And come out every night to let the city see the nigga

Telling stories that nobody relate to

Problem children that all be reppin' Octobers Own

Brand new girl, and she still growing

Brand new titties, stitches still showing

Yeah and she just praying that it heals good

I'm bout to f-ck and I'm just praying that it feels good

I really don't know much but shit I know a secret

They say more money more problems, my nigga don't believe it

I mean sure there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading

But I blew 6 million on my self and I feel amazing

Young money maker, season ticket holder

Season switching over

I come through them bitches still scorching as if I didn't notice

You niggas gettin' older, I see no threat in Yoda

I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas

that couldn't f-ck with my freshman flow

Look at that f-cking chip on your nephews shoulder

My sophomore they was all for it, they all saw it

My Juniors and senior will only get meaner

Take Care nigga

I'm calling niggas out like the umpire

Seven, grams in the blunt

Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt

It's Eastside, we in this bitch

Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch

And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch

That's my MO add a V to that shit

I'm fucked up, torn down

I'm twisted: door knob

Talk stupid, off with your head!

Nigga money talks and Mr Ed!

I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun

Energizer bunny

Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar

Ain't shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers

Money just changed everything, 
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow

Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below

My fifteen minutes started an hour ago



Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t

When I hear talkin, I just don't know what to make of it



Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it

Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit



Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with

You can see I'm pacin it so that I'm always chasin it



Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with

I hope that my success never alters our relationship



Yeah, this life is something I would die for

Octobers Own, but it's lookin like July 4th

But I just wish they'd let you try it first

This time I'm really goin off, fireworks



Chorus 

Drake 

Oh, today it begins 

I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 

I keep having the same dream 

And I think that I just realized what it means 



Alicia Keys 

All I see is fireworks, 

All i see is fireworks 

Every night it's fireworks 

Every night it's fireworks 

All i see is fireworks 

All i see is fireworks 

Taking off like fireworks 

Taking off like oh-ah-oh-oh 



Drake 

I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me 

look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery 

I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me 

who coulda predicted Lucky Strike will have you stuck with me 

Damn I kept my wits about me luckily 

what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me 

now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me 

and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me 

but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby 

what an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious 

their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it 

that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though 

you never see it coming you just get to see it go 

yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first 

now I can see it in her eyes 

Fireworks! 



Chorus 

Drake 

Oh, today it begins 

I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 

I keep having the same dream 

And I think that I just realized what it means

All i see is fireworks 

Every night it's fireworks, 

Every night it's fireworks 

All i see is fireworks 

All i see is fireworks 

Taking off like fireworks 

Taking off like oh-ah-oh-oh 



Drake 

Everything the same but it feels different 

my dad called me up knowing that I still listen 

and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin' 

It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it 

For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport 

got my mother in a place with some better decor 

she searched the entire city I let her explore 

ant now she's sayin' she more lonely than every before 

How many of our parents' marriages lasted? 

I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted 

I'm flying back home for the heritage classic 

searchin for that feeling, tell me where is the magic? 

let's stay together 'til we're ghosts 

I want to witness love, I never seen it close 

yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first 

that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks 



Chorus 

Drake 

Oh, today it begins 

I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 

I keep having the same dream 

And I think that I just realized what it means 



Alicia Keys 

All I see is fireworks, 

All I see is fireworks 

Every night it's fireworks, 

Every night it's fireworks 

All I see is fireworks

Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should have gotten back by now
but you know how much I wanted to make it
it's proabably better anyhow
so if you gotta go

if theres anything I should know

if the spotlight makes you nervous

if you looking for a purpose

you put the tea in the kettle and light it

put your hand on the metal and feel it

but do you even feel it anymore

I remember when you thought I was joking

now I'm all singing Karaoke

further than I've ever been

so if you gotta go

if there's any way I can help



[Drake rapping:]

Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner

that tells me my life is too much and it moves to Atlanta

damn, of all the places you could go

I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know

I always up too late I worry bout you there alone

in that place you call your home

warm nights and cold patron

I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy

cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady

I know they say the first love is the sweetest

but that first cut is the deepest

I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets

secrets you were telling everybody but me

don't be fooled by the money I'm still just young and unlucky

I'm surprised you couldn't tell



[Drake singing:]

I was only trying to get ahead

I was only trying to get ahead

but the spotlight makes you nervous

and you looking for a purpose



I was only trying to get ahead

I was only trying to get ahead

but the spotlight makes you nervous"

You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye, but you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.
You can stay but shawty here I go...
[Verse 1]

Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?

I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it.

I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.

I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it.

I am, still here with who I started with.

The game needed life, I put my heart in it.

I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit.

Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.

Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.

Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.

It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a flourist,

and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enourmous.

It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.

I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.

Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.

I'm trying to do better than good enough.



[Chorus]

What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.

But people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)

You promised me you would never change.

You promised me you would never change.



[Verse 2]

Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.

When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.

Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.

I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.

I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.

And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.

But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,

that I barley know at all and..

Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected

Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.

The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.

Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holding on by a thread it's..

Like I'm high right now, the guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.

That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,

'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.



[Chorus]

What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.

But people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)

You promised me you would never change.

You promised you would never change.



[Verse 3]

Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.

The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.

Which made me question when I went missing.

And when I start treating my friends different.

Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.

Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.

Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.

Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.

I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.

I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.

Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.

Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.

Did I just trade free time for camera time?

Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?

I just need some closure.

Aint no turning back for me I'm in till it's over."

Thinking about what we had and missing you,

But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too

I mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out

They always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out

Baby, don't hold on too long 'cause thats how them stories start out,

And all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out, it's Drizzy

Always gone but never hard to find

And since you can't escape me, do I ever cross your mind?

Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave,

And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but I'm good

I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle,

I'm looking forward to the memories of right now

Never forgettin' from where I came,

And no matter where I'm headed, I promise to stay the same



[Chorus - Jeezy & Drake:]

I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down

Ask your girl, I'm the realest nigga she been around

When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters,

And when you get to talkin' bout the greatest

I just really hope that (you'd think of me) [3x]

I'm doin my thing [3x]

('Cause I'm trynna be unforgettable)



[Young Jeezy:]

This just might be my realest flow ever,

When I say for life, y'all say forever

It's hard, but its fair, I told that girl ""Life hurts""

The closest you gonna get to this is a Pac t-shirt

The name's Young, baby, you know I live that thug life

The good die young, so I'mma need a thug wife

Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms

Know our jewelry prolly louder than a car alarm

Yeah, I'm in my ""used to have to sneak the car""

Now my insides are lookin like a snickers bar

Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers,

Damn right, so fly I need feathers

She saying shit in them streets, so whats the deal?

And I've done everything in the A, but fuck Chilli

So welcome to my life, no two days the same

Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the Game



[Chorus - Jeezy & Drake]



[Jeezy talking:]

Got this top dropped on this beautiful night

This beautiful night to live my beautiful life

Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife

Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife

Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah,

Unforgettable, you'll never forget this, ya understand me?

Timeless homie, unforgettable



Let me know, let me know"

Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you

And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true

Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying

I'm just here making all the music that they party to

But party on, party on, all night nigga

I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga

I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars

Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire

Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth

Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot

This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park

Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose

Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target

But a target nonetheless and I just started

Was that directed at moi? It can't be

They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free

Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner

Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner

Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music

And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar

Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you

Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,

And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you

Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you

Don't get impatient when it takes too long

Drink it all even when it tastes too strong

Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me

I promise to always give you me, the real me



[Chorus: Drake]

Who would have thought

I'd be caught in this life?

Let's celebrate with a toast

And get lost in tonight

And make it all light up

(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),

Wait until the sun goes down

We gon' make this bitch light up

Even when the sun goes down

I'm gon' make this go



[Verse 2: Jay-Z]

Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls

I'm the man of the hour

Triple entendre, don't even ask me how

Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power

Bright life'd make your whole city light up

A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub

I just landed in that G450

Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy

(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk

The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk

I don't do too much blogging

I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging

(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet

'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched

Drake, here is how they gon' come at you

Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you

In disguise, in the form of a favor

The Barzini me, watch for the traitors

(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all

That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off

The summer's ours, the winter too

Top down in the winter, that's what winners do

And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7

You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you

And since no good deed go unpunished

I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was

I once was, cool as The Fonz was

But these bright lights turned me to a monster

Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me

But I would've went insane had I remained the same me

Fuck niggas, bitches too

All I got is this money, this'll do



[Chorus: Drake]

Who would have thought

I'd be caught in this life?

Let's celebrate with a toast

And get lost in tonight

And make it all light up

Wait until the sun goes down

We gon' make this bitch light up

Wait until the sun goes down

I'm gon' make this go

I said tell me what's really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready
What's happenin'
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm bout my paper like a muthfucking scratch and win

World Series attitude, Champagne bottle life

Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night

I will have a model wife

Your bitch is as hot as ice

Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice

(Drake you got em right)

Yeah I got 'em Bun

I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun

Meeks got the weed

Hush got a gun

CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones

Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple sprite

Someone tell [? ] I'm on fire she should work tonight

Call her King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight

I'll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height

Work something, twerk something basis

She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked

I don't judge her, I don't judge her

But I could never love her cause to her I'm just a rapper

And should have met another that's why

Me and Lil Jazz bout to spazz, can you keep her

I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up

Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything

And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything

I love Nicki Minaj

I told her I'd admit it

I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it

And girl I'm fucking serious, I'm with it if you with it

Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted

Uh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment

Like I catch 'em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it

And Life ain't no rehearsal

The camera's always rollin'

So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin'

Cause it's on, you should come with me

If you got some time this is where you wanna be

We could go all night long

This could last all night long

Bet it's goin down

We gon make it right

This is what they mean when they talk about the life

We could go all night long

This could last all night long

I'm with it if you with it..."

You could thank me now
uh, go 'head
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesn't always come so instead
it's okay,

You could thank me now

uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go



[Verse 1:]

my hollow from my heart is hard to follow

lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle

aloha's to women with no ties

to men that I know well

that way there are no lies

you could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas

I'm on the brink of influential

I'm here for you niggas

I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas

I must have been hard to watch,

what a year for you niggas

it's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating

you got the resolutions, we just got reservations

living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up

and we just wanna party, patron straight up

fuck that old shit, I'm on new things

OVO clique, Red wing boot gang

yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement

who'd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic

I could relate to kids going straight to the league

when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed

and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals

you make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival

damn, I swear sports and music are so synonomous

'cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us

yeah so on behalf of the demanded

and the entertainment that you take for granted

you could thank me now...

and oh my goodness you're welcome

you're welcome

at this point me is who I'm trying to save myself from

rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them

cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from

but drink up because everyone here is good tonight

except the niggas that I came with, they good for life

yeah, thats how you know it's going down

in case another chance never comes around...



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]

Uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming

I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women

I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it

cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic

man the good girls went silent on me

they got a boyfriend or left for college on me

and all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now

that make me wish I had a little less mileage on me

but do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latte's

and low fat muffin's, do I?

Or is missing what we had outta the question

I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson

I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe's who's there before it all

I guess thats how it goes

they hear about your cons or focus on your pro's

and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul

but those same ones from your area will grow

into women that are ready to get married at hello

because of what they allow

where are they all now

I know there somewhere watching so I'm trying to make them proud

searching for the meaning

you'll find it next to me

and tell me I'm the highest, guess we finally get to see

I'm feeling like Nas who am I to disagree

they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key

it's probably why I'm in this bitch shining

jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment

I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded

and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it

I'm sorry, poolside drinking

margharita rounds

shout out to my city though I hardly be in town

I'm the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown

and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down

I'm in the world where things are taken, never given

how long they choose to love you will never be your decision

and I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen

so while I'm still here in this position...

You know alot of girls be thinking my songs are about them
But this is not to get confused
This one's for you
[Chorus:]

Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted

We can do it real big

Bigger than you ever done it

You be up on everything

Other hoes ain't never on it

I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it



Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up

When I get right I promise that we gon live it up

She make me beg for it till she give it up

And I say the same thing every single time



I say you the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had

I say you the fucking



[Verse 1:]

Know you got a roommate

Call me when it's no one there

Put the key under the mat

And you know I'll be over there

(Yup) I'll be over there

Shawty, I'll be over there

I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there

Ha. And you ain't even have to ask twice

You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice

Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life

Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life

Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on

That's when you're the prettiest

I hope that you don take it wrong

You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along

You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home

And she a patient in my waiting room

Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume

And until them girls prove it

I'm the one to never get confused with cause

Bigger than you ever done it

I say you the fucking



[Verse 2:]

Sex, Love, Pain

Baby I be on that tank shit

Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk

When my album drop

Bitches will buy it for the picture

And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister

Magazine paper girl

But money ain't the issue

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial

She call me the referee

'Cause I be so official

My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make ya pussy whistle

Like the Andy Griffith theme song

And who told you to put them jeans on

Double cup love

You the one I lean on

Feeling for a fix then you should really get ya pheen on

Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot

Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot

Get it from the back

And make ya fucking bra strap pop

All up in ya slot until the nigga hit the jackpot, sang...

Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted

We can do it real big

Bigger than you ever done it

Money just changed everything, 
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow

Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below

My fifteen minutes started an hour ago



Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t

When I hear talkin, I just don't know what to make of it



Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it

Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit



Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with

You can see I'm pacin it so that I'm always chasin it



Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with

I hope that my success never alters our relationship



Yeah, this life is something I would die for

Octobers Own, but it's lookin like July 4th

But I just wish they'd let you try it first

This time I'm really goin off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins 

I've missed them before, but won't miss them again

I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me 

look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery 

I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me 

who coulda predicted Lucky Strike will have you stuck with me 

Damn I kept my wits about me luckily 

what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me 

now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me 

and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me 

but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby 

what an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious 

their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it 

that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though 

you never see it coming you just get to see it go 

yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first 

now I can see it in her eyes 

Fireworks!

Taking off like oh-ah-oh-oh 



Drake 

Everything the same but it feels different 

my dad called me up knowing that I still listen 

and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin' 

It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it 

For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport 

got my mother in a place with some better decor 

she searched the entire city I let her explore 

ant now she's sayin' she more lonely than every before 

How many of our parents' marriages lasted? 

I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted 

I'm flying back home for the heritage classic 

searchin for that feeling, tell me where is the magic? 

let's stay together 'til we're ghosts 

I want to witness love, I never seen it close 

yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first 

that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks

Drake 

Oh, today it begins 

I've missed them before, but won't miss them again 

I keep having the same dream 

And I think that I just realized what it means

Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should have gotten back by now
but you know how much I wanted to make it
it's proabably better anyhow
so if you gotta go

if theres anything I should know

if the spotlight makes you nervous

if you looking for a purpose

you put the tea in the kettle and light it

put your hand on the metal and feel it

but do you even feel it anymore

I remember when you thought I was joking

now I'm all singing Karaoke

further than I've ever been

so if you gotta go

if there's any way I can help



[Drake rapping:]

Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner

that tells me my life is too much and it moves to Atlanta

damn, of all the places you could go

I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know

I always up too late I worry bout you there alone

in that place you call your home

warm nights and cold patron

I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy

cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady

I know they say the first love is the sweetest

but that first cut is the deepest

I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets

secrets you were telling everybody but me

don't be fooled by the money I'm still just young and unlucky

I'm surprised you couldn't tell



[Drake singing:]

I was only trying to get ahead

I was only trying to get ahead

but the spotlight makes you nervous

and you looking for a purpose

You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye, but you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.
You can stay but shawty here I go...
[Verse 1]

Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?

I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it.

I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.

I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it.

I am, still here with who I started with.

The game needed life, I put my heart in it.

I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit.

Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.

Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.

Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.

It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a flourist,

and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enourmous.

It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.

I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.

Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.

I'm trying to do better than good enough.



[Chorus]

What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.

But people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)

You promised me you would never change.

You promised me you would never change.



[Verse 2]

Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.

When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.

Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.

I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.

I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.

And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.

But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,

that I barley know at all and..

Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected

Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.

The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.

Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holding on by a thread it's..

Like I'm high right now, the guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.

That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,

'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.



[Chorus]

What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.

But people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)

You promised me you would never change.

You promised you would never change.



[Verse 3]

Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.

The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.

Which made me question when I went missing.

And when I start treating my friends different.

Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.

Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.

Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.

Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.

I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.

I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.

Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.

Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.

Did I just trade free time for camera time?

Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?

I just need some closure.

Aint no turning back for me I'm in till it's over."

'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas

All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers

Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers

I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker

Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either

and start livin' that life dawg

feels like when you gettin' to that paper hip hop hates ya

they would do it just like I do if they could

its in our nature

ahh, young and rich and out of control

Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer

I've always liked my women book and street smart

long as they got a little class like half days

[Drake:]

Yo, this is really one of my dumbest flows ever

I haven't slept in days, and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways, so I'm single

Thinking about what we had and missing you,

But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too

I mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out

They always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out

Baby, don't hold on too long 'cause thats how them stories start out,

And all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out, it's Drizzy

Always gone but never hard to find

And since you can't escape me, do I ever cross your mind?

Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave,

And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but I'm good

I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle,

I'm looking forward to the memories of right now

Never forgettin' from where I came,

And no matter where I'm headed, I promise to stay the same



[Chorus - Jeezy & Drake:]

I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down

Ask your girl, I'm the realest nigga she been around

When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters,

And when you get to talkin' bout the greatest

I just really hope that (you'd think of me) [3x]

I'm doin my thing [3x]

('Cause I'm trynna be unforgettable)



[Young Jeezy:]

This just might be my realest flow ever,

When I say for life, y'all say forever

It's hard, but its fair, I told that girl ""Life hurts""

The closest you gonna get to this is a Pac t-shirt

The name's Young, baby, you know I live that thug life

The good die young, so I'mma need a thug wife

Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms

Know our jewelry prolly louder than a car alarm

Yeah, I'm in my ""used to have to sneak the car""

Now my insides are lookin like a snickers bar

Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers,

Damn right, so fly I need feathers

She saying shit in them streets, so whats the deal?

And I've done everything in the A, but fuck Chilli

So welcome to my life, no two days the same

Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the Game



[Chorus - Jeezy & Drake]



[Jeezy talking:]

Got this top dropped on this beautiful night

This beautiful night to live my beautiful life

Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife

Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife

Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah,

Unforgettable, you'll never forget this, ya understand me?

Timeless homie, unforgettable

Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you

And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true

Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying

I'm just here making all the music that they party to

But party on, party on, all night nigga

I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga

I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars

Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire

Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth

Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot

This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park

Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose

Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target

But a target nonetheless and I just started

Was that directed at moi? It can't be

They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free

Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner

Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner

Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music

And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar

Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you

Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,

And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you

Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you

Don't get impatient when it takes too long

Drink it all even when it tastes too strong

Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me

I promise to always give you me, the real me

I'd be caught in this life?

Let's celebrate with a toast

And get lost in tonight

And make it all light up

We gon' make this bitch light up

Even when the sun goes down

I'm gon' make this go

I'm the man of the hour

Triple entendre, don't even ask me how

A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub

I just landed in that G450

Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy

(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk

The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk

I don't do too much blogging

I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging

(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet

'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched

Drake, here is how they gon' come at you

Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you

In disguise, in the form of a favor

The Barzini me, watch for the traitors

(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all

That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off

The summer's ours, the winter too

Top down in the winter, that's what winners do

And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7

You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you

And since no good deed go unpunished

I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was

I once was, cool as The Fonz was

But these bright lights turned me to a monster

Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me

But I would've went insane had I remained the same me

Fuck niggas, bitches too

All I got is this money, this'll do

I'd be caught in this life?

I'm on the brink of influential

I must have been hard to watch,

what a year for you niggas

it's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating

you got the resolutions, we just got reservations

living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up

and we just wanna party, patron straight up

fuck that old shit, I'm on new things

OVO clique, Red wing boot gang

yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement

who'd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic

I could relate to kids going straight to the league

when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed

and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals

you make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival

you're welcome

at this point me is who I'm trying to save myself from

rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them

cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from

but drink up because everyone here is good tonight

except the niggas that I came with, they good for life

yeah, thats how you know it's going down

in case another chance never comes around...



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]

Uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming

I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women

I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it

cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic

man the good girls went silent on me

they got a boyfriend or left for college on me

and all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now

that make me wish I had a little less mileage on me

but do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latte's

and low fat muffin's, do I?

Or is missing what we had outta the question

I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson

I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe's who's there before it all

I guess thats how it goes

they hear about your cons or focus on your pro's

and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul

but those same ones from your area will grow

into women that are ready to get married at hello

because of what they allow

where are they all now

I know there somewhere watching so I'm trying to make them proud

searching for the meaning

you'll find it next to me

and tell me I'm the highest, guess we finally get to see

I'm feeling like Nas who am I to disagree

they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key

it's probably why I'm in this bitch shining

jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment

I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded

and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it

I'm sorry, poolside drinking

margharita rounds

shout out to my city though I hardly be in town

I'm the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown

and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down

I'm in the world where things are taken, never given

how long they choose to love you will never be your decision

and I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen

so while I'm still here in this position...

I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back

I really wish y'all would fall back

But gettin rich s'posed to solve that

And these days, women make offers

And who the hell am I to say (No, no, no)?

My ex sendin' late night texts

'Cause she don't know how to let (Go, go, go)

Uh, she in love

And as for them pretty light-skinned models

Standin in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us

Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear

Saying she should be the one I see every time that I'm here

But when am I really even here?

Black Surburban with the tint on it

Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it

The game got these old handprints on it

But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it

Uh, and start over

And show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck

And we only gettin older

So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past

It's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last

You just hope that it last



Throw your ones up in the air

Throw your ones up in the air for her, oh-oh

Throw your ones up in the air

We all got dreams and we all star reaching, all star peaking, all-star weekend...

One hotel room and all ya'll sleeping, housekeeping knock to see if all ya'll decent

Young girls envy the life ya'll leading, never satisfied with a nice calm evening

You be at the games looking right all season,

But you always with me on the night ya'll leaving



Ass low, ass low, I always request you

You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue

Carry you inside get you some water and undress you

I give you my all, and the next morning you'll forget:

Who, or Why, or How, or When

Tonight is probably about to happen all over again

And she live in a mindset that I could never move to

Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you

Uh... because I never had you...

Although I would be glad to...

I probably go and tattoo... your name on my heart,

I swear

I start,

To think,

That I'm going crazy

And when I leave, I always come right back here

The young spitter that everybody in rap fear

A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year

The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier

Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed

Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head

Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me

'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD

Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it

But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways

And my mother tried to run away from home

But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway

And she cried to me, so I cried too

And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2""

And 40, that was all before I showed up

And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up

Damn, my reality just set in

And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in

I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in

So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end

My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow

And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show

And life change for us every single week, so

It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:

Wise words from a decent man

Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand

This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan

And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man

In-person I am everything and more

I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before

But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore

I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store

Yeah, just call me ""Shoppin' Bag Drizzy""

Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""

And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy

While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy

I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad

I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads

And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...

I just don't know... how to say it... to you



Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch, it's Car-tey

Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't

Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates

Cheese, but she's not in this portrait

And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray

I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate

I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray

And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay

Tired of hearin' bullshit, bring on the cow shit

Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit

And that's word to Toronto

So high up, I got birds in the condo

Ha, ain't that a female dog?

Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, ""God""

Uh, when did you get like this
Least you coulda done is gone 
an give me a warning

I don't regret like this

So I'll be right there when 

you wake up in the morning

Saying, this just ain't my style

You can't say you're happy either

You don't even smile, for me



[Chorus:]

Did you agree, we should let it be

And did you agree, it's a must,

Let's call the whole thing off

We used to have a night for us

Let's call the whole thing off

We used to have a night for us



[Verse 2:]

When you decided 

to knock on my door

Did you remember 

what happened before?

The look on your face 

said you were expecting more

But some things look 

better inside of the store



[Chorus:]

Did you agree, we should let it be

And did you agree, it's a must,

Let's call the whole thing off

We used to have a night for us

Let's call the whole thing off

We used to have a night for us



[Verse 3:]

Look

Leave me, leave me, 

I can't fuckin stand you

Wish I had the courage 

to say everything I planned to

My girlfriend, my girlfriend, 

call herself my girlfriend

Tell me that we posed to be 

together til the world end

But, I don't really feel that

I just really wanna turn 

the wheels back

Give you all ya sweaters 

and ya heels back

Convince you that time 

will heal that

Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue

I swear everytime I call

You just tell me how I don't call you

Why you do that... 

do that... do that

Yeah



[Chorus:]

Did you agree, we should let it be

And did you agree, it's a must,

Let's call the whole thing off

We used to have a night for us

Let's call the whole thing off

One time for the homie DJ Screw

Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch



Up so high even when I'm coming down

Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town

I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer

Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah

Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man

I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can

She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it

'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it



And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter

And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner

Airport stunting, flying charters overseas

Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's

Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone

But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone

So I'ma sip this drank until that mothafucka gone

And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on



I don't give you the time you deserve from me

This is something I know, I know, I know

So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston

Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow

But I do it to her



Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout

3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot

It's on once again and I never pretend

A nigga staying G 'til the end



Ayy, yeah

I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know

I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston

Candy paint switching colors in the light

It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city

Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke

It feel like, like everything's just moving slow

Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone"

It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

Uh, look, I'm the property of October

I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured

Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over

I think better when I'm not sober

I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder

Private flights back home, no stop over

Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over

The shit my mother look shocked over

Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven

A migraine, take two Excedrin

I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven

And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second

I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard

And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars

Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours

‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star

I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane

Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name

One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change

And show me the city that I without fear claim

What I set seems to never extinguish

Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish

Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers

My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer

Heh, or alarm, or whatever

She be here at six in the morn' if I let her

But I never get attracted to fans

'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam

I always knew that I could figure

How to get these label heads to offer him good figures

And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous

'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas

It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over

Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over

Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker

I'll slow roast ya, got no holster

Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster

Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster

G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker

They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker

I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier

My cup runneth over

The same niggas I ball with, I fall with

On some southern drawl shit

Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit

D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all

These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on

Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off

First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go



And I'd take probation

I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation

Private plane, pick location

I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation

Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard

And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it

But in the meantime you can call me young Roy

Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge

Shit, don't leave me unguarded

And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi

Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed

All that blood like the Red Sea parted

My gun go crazy like it's retarded

Red light on it like it's recording

I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'

My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't

Better dig in your pocket and pay homage

Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'

Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'

No, I didn't say that I'm flawless

But I damn sure don't tarnish

My pistol got comments for your garments

I'm so high I can vomit on a comet

K-Y, no homo, I'm on it

Weezy F Baby, new born bitch

You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch

I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get

Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit

And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit

That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit

That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit

And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit

I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!""

Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!

You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat

Fireman burn down your entire street

So fly I'ma take off when I leap

Bye! And you can suck my wings

Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming

Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things

I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens

But I ain't the dealer

House full of bitches like Tila Tequila

Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror

My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her?

Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?

We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried

But when you're all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there
Come right in, set your bag down

Took a night off for you

Go ahead and turn the lights off

But keep your heels on

They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh

Know you hate explaining how you want it done

Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl

Can you work without a second for some fun?

Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl

And I know what to do with it

I know what to do with it

I know what to do with it

I been waiting for so long to get you all alone

Now I finally got you right here

So, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone

'Cause I wanna make one thing clear

I want you on top, so let your hair down

Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go

So they stick around kicking out feedback

And I entertaining as if I need that

I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that

My privacy about the only thing I need back

But it's hard to think of them polite flows

Mr. fano poloto suits on your night clothes

And jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes

And you still make it even when they say your flight closed

Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows

Life was so full

Now this shits just been light pole

Always said I'd say it all on the right track

But in this game u only lose when you fight back

Black diamond bracelets

Showing you the basics

I can't live and hold the camara

Someone gotta tape dis

I make hits and like a bitch

Just married I ain't miss

24 hours from greatness

I'm that close to

Don't ever forget the moment

You began to doubt

Transitioning from fitting in to standing out

Los angeles, cabanas or atlanta south

Watchin home shows

Embarrassed to pull my camera out

And my mother embarased

To put my phantom out

So I park about 5 houses down

She said I shouldn't have until I have the crown

But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around

So she wonder where my mind is and counts in the minus

But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin city like your highness

Got niggas reactin without a sinus

Cause what I'm working with is timeless

And promoters trying to get me out to they club

And say I have fun but I can't imagine how

Cause I just see my ex-girl

Standing with my next girl

Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin right now

And shit could get weird unless they all down

And so I stay clear

We from a small town

And everybody talks and everybody listen

And somehow the truth just always comes up missing

I've always been something dat these lables can't buy

Especially if they tryin to take a peice of my soul

And still b only tellin tales ""damn drake fly""

And he just be like ""silly mother fucker I know""

That was your bad

How could you pass up on em?

He just take the records

And he gas up on em

Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em

Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em

Oh they did pole

At least they try to

And that's what happens

When you spitting what's inside you

But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video

And they think they can market you

However they decide to naww

Before they told me to do me

And don't listen to anybody that knew me

Cause who of known me would

Mean that there's a new me

And if you think I've changed in the slightest

Could of fooled me

Baa into my city I'm da 2-3

Drug dealers live vicariously through me

I quit school and is not because I'm lazy

I'm just not the social type

And campus life is crazy understand

I could get money with my eyes closed

Lost some of my hottest versus down at cabo

So if you find a blackberry with the sides scroll

Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know

Cause they need it much more than I ever will

I got new shit

I'm gettin better still

Little niggas put my name in their verses

Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal

Future said cause it's ye shit you better kill

And I think it's got them making of a legend feel

Problem with these other niggas they

Ain't never real

Yea... that's all I can say"

Keep avoiding all the questions 

you can teach me many things 

I'm just scared to learn a lesson 



The pressures on 

Both hearts beat like a metronome 

Both N'Sync like a Justin song 

Feels so right but 

it's just soo wrong 

I wonder where my world 'bout 

Where niggas said I know, 

tryna talk my girl out 

And her friends say I ain't the one to go for 

She just get jealous cause you always get approached more 

Oh well tell her fall back 

caught up in some more shit tell her call back 

Tell her get a man that ain't 

cheating on her ass 

With a girl that I know 

yeah tell her all that, that 

And as for you I think I 

know your the one 

The closest I've come 

I'm probably... 



A little bit 

A little bit 

A little bit in love with you 

I guess that I'm a little bit 

A little bit 

A little bit 

A little bit in love with you Oh oho 

Lalalala love with me 

Oh oho, oh oh

You know alot of girls be thinking my songs are about them
But this is not to get confused
This one's for you
[Chorus:]

Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted

We can do it real big

Bigger than you ever done it

You be up on everything

Other hoes ain't never on it

I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it



Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up

When I get right I promise that we gon live it up

She make me beg for it till she give it up

And I say the same thing every single time



I say you the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had

I say you the fucking



[Verse 1:]

Know you got a roommate

Call me when it's no one there

Put the key under the mat

And you know I'll be over there

(Yup) I'll be over there

Shawty, I'll be over there

I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there

Ha. And you ain't even have to ask twice

You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice

Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life

Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life

Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on

That's when you're the prettiest

I hope that you don take it wrong

You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along

You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home

And she a patient in my waiting room

Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume

And until them girls prove it

I'm the one to never get confused with cause



[Chorus:]

Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted

We can do it real big

Bigger than you ever done it

You be up on everything

Other hoes ain't never on it

I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it



Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up

When I get right I promise that we gon live it up

She make me beg for it till she give it up

And I say the same thing every single time



I say you the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had

I say you the fucking



[Verse 2:]

Sex, Love, Pain

Baby I be on that tank shit

Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk

When my album drop

Bitches will buy it for the picture

And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister

Magazine paper girl

But money ain't the issue

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial

She call me the referee

'Cause I be so official

My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make ya pussy whistle

Like the Andy Griffith theme song

And who told you to put them jeans on

Double cup love

You the one I lean on

Feeling for a fix then you should really get ya pheen on

Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot

Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot

Get it from the back

And make ya fucking bra strap pop

All up in ya slot until the nigga hit the jackpot, sang...



[Chorus:]

Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted

We can do it real big

Bigger than you ever done it

You be up on everything

Other hoes ain't never on it

I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it



Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up

When I get right I promise that we gon live it up

She make me beg for it till she give it up

And I say the same thing every single time



I say you the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had [x2]

But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner

And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour

Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana

So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it

But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it

You could show up at the party on dirty public transit

And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids

Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed

With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed

I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'

But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'



I got to be unstoppable

I got to be unstoppable

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

I got to be unstoppable

I got to be unstoppable

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie



Ahem, my name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect

And I work harder than hard workin'

Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface

Therefore I act a clown

Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down

So over-stand me

I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy

And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy

And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana

And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'

And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick

Your girl singin' to my shit, like, ""a-la-la-lollipop""

She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop

And she say I freak that pussy better

Better than her gynecologist, ho just

Text me whenever you want some more dick

More dick, old bitch, young bitch

But I be like damn, all I got is one dick



I got to be unstoppable

I got to be unstoppable

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie



I got the talk, the beat and bass

Give me one, I'll take it, make you lose your place

Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace

I break it, break it you can't stop me in this ra-race



I got to be unstoppable

I got to be unstoppable

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

I got to be unstoppable

I got to be unstoppable

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

Uh-huh
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'

And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned

I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions

Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'

That's why I never follow y'all suggestions

I just always did my own thing

Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas

I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes

Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better

'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her



It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends

That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on

Yeah, wrong way down a one-way

Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday

Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who

Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you""

And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house

Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth

Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her

I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther

I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady

They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady

Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy

Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady

Damn, whose line is it anyways?

I'm in a daze, you been amazed

Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage

I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze

I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice

And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright

Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will

I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real

Put it to your life



It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends

Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest

Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused

The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's

Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust

Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on

I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb

I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight

From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike

Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night

Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white

Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right

Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night

This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long

The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song

UGK and Young Money, too strong

Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy

I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy

'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy

Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy

Soowoo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch

And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch

I'm so uptown

And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

And now I'm on that rock shit

But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit

Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?

Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?

You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to

And I finally get a moment to myself

I will realize you were everything I'm missing

And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else



So can you do me a favor?

If I pull it together, make it sooner than later

We won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long

But please don't move on

I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?

What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?

And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?

Night's fallin', lights glowing

And I'm just trying to pay the price owing

And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing

And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments

Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision

'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision

So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants

'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear



So can you do me a favor?

I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone

See my house is not a home

Fuck is going on?

Where did we go wrong?

Where do we belong?

Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone

Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on

When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone

Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne

And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't

Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known

To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone

Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown

I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown

It's only been three years

Look at how I've grown

I'm just in my zone

I call this shit the calm

Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm

Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond

Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long

You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm

Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known

I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause



You know everything gon' be all right, I promise

I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but

40 Mama always say don’t ask permission

Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah

Say



Uh

And life is so insane

Look what I became trying to make a name

All my first dates are interrupted by my fame

Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain

They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain

It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain

Women need attention, therefore, women will complain

Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame

Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game

I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne

It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing

So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain

Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange

'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed

Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range

And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change

Damn, and I can only feel his pain

'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain

So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again

He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain

I'm why your girl heart is in a sling

Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame

As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king

With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain

Yeah, and see, this is the thang

What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain

The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane

Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah



Uh

I said I call this shit the calm

But I’m the furthest thing from calm

Swear I’m putting on

But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like

Man"

And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?

You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?

Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past

That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside

So I don't ever question you, and damn

Late, late, late, late



Did he take your clothes off just like this?

Did he give you loving just like this?

Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?

Tell me baby, am I too late?

So what you want an award or somethin'?

I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'

I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing

Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'

But I ain't with the hard talk

I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk

Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark

Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start

I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'

My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'

And my verses gettin' stupider

Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?

Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular

I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula

I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula

When I break it down, when I, when I break it down

I hug and kiss the drum kick

I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit

But, you could never beat my ass, pause

Again, dammit y'all, again

Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in

I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win

If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him

And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them

Right, uh



It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy

Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy

They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege

But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say

I got the key to happiness and all the copies

Remember this day like you bought a poppy

And damn, how I get so nice?

I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice

Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'

I always choose dough like it's my only option

'Cause money always knows best

Chain snatch flow, they say ""Get it off your chest""

And I'm what all the fuss about

And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout

Hit me at the office, same extension

Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention"
