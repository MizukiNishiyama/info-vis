Came through dripping, D&G, always ducking TMZ

Flow still need that EMT, tell her get at me and see

I'm the type of talk, but bitches is a kindly shocker

I get it before they cop it, always been that type of shopper

And I never tell a lie, I just put one in the sky

I just popped me a transformer, getting money 'til we die

'Til we die we gon' be fly, made a milli' in Shanghai

I don't need job applications, for that pressure I apply

That is why they gotta lie, that is just how they get by

But my flow still gon' be wavy and your flow still gon' be dry

I done fucked the world up, in ten short years

Had teachers like Weezy F. and been all ears

Blue studs that's VVS, then get more peers

They been praying on my downfall, still need more prayers, I'ma



Fuck the bag up and fuck your daddy

I'ma stay up like I've popped 3 Addys

Girl with the blonde hair, they call me Barbie

Let's get faded and have a party, yeah

If you got that bum, put your hands in the air

Catch me somewhere fuckin' a blunt up

I'm high as hell, mind everywhere

Still mind over matter

Pockets getting fatter, elevate like a ladder

.30 and that .40 make you percolate like a dancer

I'm colder than the North Pole, Blitzen and Prancer

She say she from the strip pole, she a dirty dancer

Her ex-nigga too low, she don't got no standards

He ain't right, me? You don't live a better life

Ran it up like Jerry Rice, I don't gotta say it twice

This is real life, your nigga is Fisher-Price

I'll never fall, they'll never September me 
Pretty Trini girl, that is what they render me 
Nah nigga, that bitch don't resemble me
How you leave me for bitch under me? 
When the shit hit the fan, don't run to me 

Your daddy wasn't a man so, to some degree 

I guess it run in your jeans, Dungarees 



Oh, it was pretty sticky for us, so we had to shut it down 

I really asked her, why you're with me? 

And my heart's in critical condition 

If you listening baby, just come get me! 

I need bottles of Henny 

Drink a lot of water 

I'm in that special place without water! 

But she the only one with me! 

I tell her mommy found a new life in the city 

Daddy gets tight, so he can't feel the gravity 

Cause any other place is way better than reality! 

Oh, boy yes I know I need problem 

Baby, no, you don't know what you got till it's gone, oh yeah! 



She don't remember me, don't remember me 

She don't remember me 

She don't remember me, don't remember me 

Don't remember me 



Oh, he was with me for while 

Now he got another girl, thought i gave him plenty 

Did it all but I guess it wasn't enough and now I never give my heart to many

Empty bottles of Henny 

Is that all for yah? 

Now you don't even answer when I call ya 

You can buy the whole city 

Money ain't a thing if you're not here with me 

Real-real love, no, I don't want a parody 

Love is such a war, I don't wanna be a casualty, Oh no 

Yes I know i did wrong 

Baby, no, you don't know what you got till it's gone, oh yes! 



No, no I don't wanna lose ya 

Just say you'll remember me tonight 

No, no I don't wanna lose ya 

Just say you'll remember me tonight 



And how could I ever forget you? 

Though at times I wonder if I ever knew you 

And wonder if you ever knew me"

I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel

And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful

As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool

Cherish these days, man do they go quick

Just yesterday, I swear it was '06

Ten years ago, that's when you proposed

I look down, yes I suppose



All things go, all things go

All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone

While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls

So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong

Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young

We keep goin', we go, we go, we go

We wake back up and do it all again

We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

When all is said and done, look at what we've become

I just want you to know, that I did it for you



I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence

His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him

Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?

Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same

Even though they know that I love him

Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me

And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me

I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me



All things go, all things go

All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone

While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls

So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong

Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young

We keep goin', we go, we go, we go

We wake back up and do it all again

We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

When all is said and done, look at what we've become

I just want you to know, that I did it for you



Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business

I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas

Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me

Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness

I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact

I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that

She never understands, why I'm so overprotective

The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected

I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""

My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute

So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them

It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him

And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him

And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him

Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint

Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint



All things go, all things go

All things go, all things go"

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said don't touch me I lied, I lied

I can't fall for you, can't give my all to you

I can't let you think that Imma let the game stall for you

Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me

You said you thought you was ready and I said let's see

But I ain't mean that, I need some fucking proof

Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose

You just a heart breaker, won't let you break mine

Cause I'll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines



I lied

Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you

Who knows, who knows, so I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh



Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied

I thought eventually, you would let me go

That was my insecurities, and my ego

Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw

Miss the way we kiss miss, the d o

Man it was good while it lasted

That shit wasn't real, it was magic

If it was a record, it would have been classic

But fuck you though, orgasmic



This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling

Stalling the truth, who knew what you'd

Do If I let you in, my mama ain't raised no fool

I am not your usual typical type

Who would protect me if I never hide?

Falling so fast I am afraid of you



So I lied, I lied, I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

I lied, ooh baby, oooh

Cause what if I let myself go with you"

Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves

You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs

Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs



Are you alone? Do you need someone?

Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?

Thousand words don't change a thing

Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?



Where did you go? Couldn't see

I was too busy

Could've just said no

Where would you go? I think I know



Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o

Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul

Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll

Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control

Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes

Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious

Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?

Another slap to the face, another uppercut

I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya

Not cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya

I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya

But is you stayin' or goin'?

I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it

How come you never show it?

All this love you speak of

All I want is to love and to be loved

(To love and to be loved)



I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win

And I'm coming undone

Cause the tears don't end



Where did you go? Couldn't see

I was too busy

Could've just said no

Where would you go? I think I know

Who had Eminem on the first album?

Who had Kanye saying ""She a problem""?

Who the fuck came in the game made her own cologne?

Who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?

Why the fuck I gotta say it, though?

You niggas don't know it yet?

Football touchdown on the Boeing jet

You my son, but I'm just not showing yet

Miss Icy, but it ain't snowing yet

You can tell I'm the illest cause my dividend is the biggest

Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas (Oh!)

Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?

They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes!

You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay Z and Diddy

These bitches suck so I Nick Ninety(?) bitches BJ

They want that union, they want that D. Wade

I tell a ho ""just be happy they getting leeway""

My name Barbie, bitch (My name Barbie, bitch)

Alexander made me Queen

I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch

Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing

I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something

I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket

I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?

Cash money, getting six albums

No bitch niggas want to bitch out

You niggas apologize and a nigga diss you?

That's a big problem

Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs

(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)

I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me

I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me

He could tell that I was wifey material

He was liking my style in my videos

I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz

So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo

Cause its too much, and its too clutch

Who wants rumors of the two of us

But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind

But what if I met the one and your wasting your time

But you waited

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes

And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved

But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies



You could never make eye contact

Everything you got was based off of my contacts

You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat

Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap

You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it

You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it

Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it

I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it

I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'

Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public

Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating

Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies

I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace

But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate

I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend

What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend

When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em

If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some

What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?

I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me

I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony

This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

But there was something that I should've asked, all along

I'mma ask on the song



So does she know I've been in that bed before?

A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth

If I was just another girl

Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you

There's one thing I need to know

So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself



Do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

And I knew better than to look in your eyes

They only pretend you would be mine

And you know how you made me believe

We should all disappear right now

Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car

And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?

Cop cars with the loose change

I ain't gotta compete with a single soul

I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll

Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul

You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now?

Uhh, do you hear me?

I can't let a wack nigga, get near me

I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me

I ain't never need a man, to take care of me

Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this

I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist

Your whole style and approach, I invented

And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it



Uh, thinkin' out loud

I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile

LOL to the bank checkin' my account

Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account

Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy

Cuddle buddies on the low

You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning

Cause she gonna say ""I know""

Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet

I'll put my leg on the tub

Girl, this my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it

But bitch you dancing with the stars

I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important

I bought some cocaine, you can snort it

She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet

Suck the white off like chocolate

I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless

Smallest regardless, largest in charge and born in New Orleans

Get killed for Jordans

Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunech and Barbie

Picture pretendin' and give all these bitches piggyback

Picture usin' me and the Barbz and never givin' back

Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black

Ain't at the mall but between me and them, it's a gap

Pictures sayin' that you the queen and knowin' it's a fact

Picture my head givin' wet and wavy, strawberry daq'

Yo, matter of fact, let me take that back before they steal that

Picture me openin' the vault, bitch, I seal that

Picture them disses stickin' like grits, bitches feel that

Picture me tellin' bitches catch it, outer field that

Picture me not tellin' my lil' niggas drill that

Picture you endin' up under the seat, where the dread at?

Picture not listenin' when I said that you would dread that

I mean locs ho, you-you's a chop ho

I'm number one, y'all go argue over top four

Clean, sweep, you gettin' mopped, ho

Picture me dressed in black, they callin' me Miss Mary Mack

Let me, let me, let me, let me
Pull off and I always hit 'em
He actin' like I ain't always with him

My heart sayin' that I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him

And it ain't no more debatin', this time it's an ultimatum

I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him

Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him

I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him

Twenty years later them decisions, I don't regret them

Just wish you would give me space when I really need it

To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated

Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated

Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed

Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it

Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk

Just did a detox, now I wanna spark



I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful

I made a song for you, and sang you're beautiful

Oh, you're so, so irresistible

Take me to somewhere mystical

Your soul

Do you know? For you I promise I'll try

For you I promise I'll try

For you I promise I'll try



Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart

She bad as fuck, but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault

She got ambition like them niggas, and the vision for herself

So she can't rest until she feel like she done made a mark

So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part

Sometimes you gotta play the back

But when you do, make sure you play it smart

All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard

They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a Rated-R

You like her, love her like a brother, like a manager, an A&R

Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard

Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart

Yet, you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across

But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God

To keep the family together, at a time when it's so regular to break apart

So God forbid y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought

It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath from your lungs

I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from

I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones

That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come

Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun

As if they life was somehow perfect and they never been plunged

Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done

It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none

For real



I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful

I made a song for you, I sang you're beautiful (Oh)

You're so dope, so many reasons to hold me close

Take me to somewhere mystical

A memory in the makin'

Call me

Won't you call me? (Call)

No, you gone

I'll only hurt you if you let me

Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)

Why didn't you come back to get me?

Let me, let me, let me be

Why would anyone want to love me?

Rich, yes, but are you happy? (Rich, yes, but are you happy?)

All this guilt you carry is heavy (All of this guilt is heavy)

You've already made your peace with me

One day, you'll have to forgive mommy

But she knows you know too much already (Don't you know too much already?)



I'll only hurt you if you let me

Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)

And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that (Ah)

Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that



But nothin' is better sometimes

Once we've both said our goodbyes

Let's just let it go

Sometimes you gotta play the back

But when you do, make sure you play it smart

Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart

Yet, you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across

But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God

To keep the family together, at a time when it's so regular to break apart

So God forbid y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought

It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath from your lungs

I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from

I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones

That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come

Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun

As if they life was somehow perfect and they never been plunged

Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done

It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none

I could tell he the one 'cause they hatin' on him

Used to be a high roller, but I skated on him

When he went away, then I just waited on him

Came back, then I got X-rated on him

Never, never hesitated on him

Even thought I had to go up, elevated on him

Had the trap house, but it got raided on him

But I kept it real, player, never traded on him, uh

I mean, I wouldn't call 'em mini-me's

More like the whiskey to the raggedy, I sent him in, plus I mean

What if I'm showin' for gettin' in

Me and my girls been them hoes, start weedin' them, uh

When the sun hit his eyes, I wanna star-star, tw-twinkle at night

Guys, I just can't say bye

Said at least be tight, let me samurai fly

Lookin' for him, tell him meet me at the diner (Diner)

Got him smilin' 'cause he know I outshine her (Shine her)

Had to pop her just to remind her

Easy lil' ho, don't know my M.O

If I want your nigga, then just let him go

Can't sit in my seat, can't sit in my row

He been said I'm yes, he been said you no

He got that fetish for some pretty feet

He got that Super Bass, make my heart skip a beat, I mean

Red cups like double D's

Chanel bags everywhere, that's double C's

Uh, you rich bitch, buy in your dreams

You know we gettin' to the bag, keepin' it a bean

Hi
No, uh-uh
Say hi
Hi

Don't you know I'm no good for you?

I've learned to lose you, can't afford to

Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'

But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own



You never got to meet papa (I could lie, say I like it like that)

He sweet proper, he keep mama (Like it like that)

On my toes, I needed help (I could lie, and say I like it like that)

You booked a flight in three days (Like it like that)

You'd meet papa (Mm)

The waiting, the gazing

The painting, the raging

The raving, the pacing

The praying, the shaking

I must admit, I was breaking

I must admit, I was taking

I must admit, my heart was racing

Telephone waiting, make it

I just believed you wakin'

A memory in the makin'

Call me

Won't you call me? (Call)

No, you gone



(Are you gone already?)

Are you gone already?

I'll only hurt you if you let me

Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)

And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own



So deal, 'Nika, it's real, 'Nika (I could lie, say I like it like that)

Don't stress, Onika, so blessed, Onika (Like it like that)

Today, it's 12/3/23 (I could lie, say I like it like that)

Your baby's three, he's the best, Onika (Like it like that)

Set me, set me, set me free

Why didn't you come back to get me?

Let me, let me, let me be

Why would anyone want to love me?

Rich, yes, but are you happy? (Rich, yes, but are you happy?)

All this guilt you carry is heavy (All of this guilt is heavy)

You've already made your peace with me

One day, you'll have to forgive mommy

But she knows you know too much already (Don't you know too much already?)



I'll only hurt you if you let me

Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)

And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that (Ah)

Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that



But nothin' is better sometimes

Once we've both said our goodbyes

Let's just let it go

Let me let you go



Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that"

They don't know the half 'til they cracked in two

So called beef with who, wait, who?

Broke a couple rap niggas hearts in two

Now that my jack pun interviews (Interviews, interviews)

It's clear to see they wanna be me

Hit the road, E-X-I-T

My flow, they B-I-T

Shots thrown, but I-D-C

Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat

I'm not impressed, I say, ""Yo, the D mad weak""

Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat

I told him that he had the chance of a lifetime

Who wanna be a millionaire? I'm your lifeline

Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black

Ain't at the mall but between me and them, it's a gap

Pictures sayin' that you the queen and knowin' it's a fact

Picture my head givin' wet and wavy, strawberry daq'

Yo, matter of fact, let me take that back before they steal that

Picture me openin' the vault, bitch, I seal that

Picture them disses stickin' like grits, bitches feel that

Picture me tellin' bitches catch it, outer field that

Picture me not tellin' my lil' niggas drill that

Picture you endin' up under the seat, where the dread at?

Picture not listenin' when I said that you would dread that

I mean locs ho, you-you's a chop ho

Pull off and I always hit 'em
He actin' like I ain't always with him

My heart sayin' that I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him

And it ain't no more debatin', this time it's an ultimatum

I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him

Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him

I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him

Twenty years later them decisions, I don't regret them

Just wish you would give me space when I really need it

To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated

Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated

Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed

Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it

Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk

Just did a detox, now I wanna spark



I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful

I made a song for you, and sang you're beautiful

Oh, you're so, so irresistible

Take me to somewhere mystical

Your soul

Do you know? For you I promise I'll try

For you I promise I'll try

For you I promise I'll try



Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart

She bad as fuck, but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault

She got ambition like them niggas, and the vision for herself

So she can't rest until she feel like she done made a mark

So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part

Sometimes you gotta play the back

But when you do, make sure you play it smart

All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard

They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a Rated-R

You like her, love her like a brother, like a manager, an A&R

Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard

Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart

Yet, you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across

But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God

To keep the family together, at a time when it's so regular to break apart

So God forbid y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought

It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath from your lungs

I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from

I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones

That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come

Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun

As if they life was somehow perfect and they never been plunged

Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done

It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none

For real



I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful

I made a song for you, I sang you're beautiful (Oh)

You're so dope, so many reasons to hold me close

When I go, I can't take the money with me

Gotta keep a heater 'round, they tryna get me, woah

Real or fake, sorry, baby, I don't know (Baby, I don't know)

They don't know me but they always judgin' my life

They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life

They gon' talk about me whether I'm wrong or I'm right

I don't need no more drama in my life

My life, my life, my life (My life)

My life, my life, my life

My life, my life, my life (My life, my life, my life)



Once I had a love and it was a gas

Soon turned out had a heart of glass

Seemed like the real thing, only to find

Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind"

Never upset you, just wanted to sex you

Never, ever would've left you

Tell me, I'll come back and get you

Pickin' the issues

And after I ball and that jet gon' get charted (Yeah, mm-hmm)

Do what you gotta do

Stop beatin' up on yourself, handle it gently

I will never be convinced that He is not there, oh

Be courageous, He never changes

There's a father who is present, and He sees us

I found my reason, your presence, I blow my faith for you

I saw the blessings come down and I start praisin' you

You gave me spiritual gifts I was afraid to use

I was in a rush, but you said you were crushed
And I said, ""I'd be back, it's okay""
I wish I'd hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you

I wish l didn't waste precious time the night when I called you

I wish I remembered to say I'd do anything for you

Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd bore you



Listen

So close, but we were so distant

Wish I'da known in that instant

Ignored the hints or I missed it

I killed it

You'd always be in attendance

No flights, but always attеndant

Handwritten letter, you pеnned it

Them nights we wish never ended

Those rules that we wish we bended

Heartbreak that we never mended

Those messages we unsended

Best friends we somehow unfriended

Ain't care 'bout who we offended

Parties they wish we attended

Got drunk and laughed, it was splendid



I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you

I wish l didn't waste precious time the night when I called you (Ooh)

I wish I remembered to say I'd do anything for you

Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd bore you

Wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight

When every label turned me down, and then they laughed about it

I 'member goin' home and writin' fifty more raps

Just 'cause I knew you really wanted me to fall back

I 'member one of my first crushes in the fifth grade

He got killed, stabbed in the neck with a switchblade (Ooh)

I 'member when this girl in the hood thought she caught me slippin'

I got arrested, I assaulted with a deadly weapon

They say they hate Nicki, mad 'cause they ain't Nicki

All of the colors in the world, you couldn't paint Nicki (Ooh)

I never tried for that, these bitches die for that

I swear it, that's on my life, I'd never lie for that

I told Drake that he don't owe me nothin', never did

I prayed that Wayne always remembered that I never slid

Look at all the shit that y'all threw at me, and I never did

Greatest female rapper to ever live, and that's on my kid (Memories)

I could've overdosed, could've been comatosed

Wait, hold on, Juice, I feel the baby kickin', holy smokes

I prayed for a son, my husband wanted one

If they ask about me, tell 'em I was one of one

So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon

Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'

So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?

Yeah, I said it, has-been

Hang it up, flatscreen

(Haha) Plasma

Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma

I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine

I got bars, sentencin

I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt

And I'll kick that hoe, punt

Forced trauma, blunt

You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front

You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it

Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with

You li'l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock

I am a movie, camera block

You outta work, I know it's tough

But enough is enough

[Eminem]

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain

A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame

Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain

An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame

You don't like it then peel off, bitch

Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut

So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off

Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off

Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod

Quit hollerin' Why, God? He ain't got shit to do with it

Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad

I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra

Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch

Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad

With fake tits and a bad dye job

Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad

So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod

And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed

Set up the camera and pissed twice on her

Look, two pees and a tripod!

The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?

Kick it back in its face, my God

It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd

But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

The wo-world is my punchin' bag and

If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots

Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me

Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it

Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon

You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end

I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic

Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?

Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho

(Ni-ni-ni) Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot

Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?

Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot

Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top

I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'

I got em scared, shook, panickin'

Overseas, church, Vatican

You at a stand, still, mannequin

You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?

I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite

And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike

Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite

I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's

Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs

I call the play, now do you see why?

These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)



[Eminem]

A-a-a-a-all you li'l faggots can suck it

No homo, but I'ma stick it to em like refrigerator magnets

And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend

Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if

You have the same passion that I have

Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass

You assdicks had gastric bypass

Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass

And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)

Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony

Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass

You know what time it is, so why ask?

When Shady and Nicki's worlds class

It's (high class) meets (white trash)

Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me

Dunk on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here, get some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench

These birds copy every word, every inch

But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (brrr)

I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot

Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot

Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc

Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock



Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been conned

Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on

I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed

He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song

I-I-I been on, bitch, you been conned

Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on

Ayo, I been off, Lara been Croft

Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off



Oh, I get it, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy

Well when's the last time you see a bad guy do the rap game like me?



I went and copped the chopsticks

Put it in my bun just to pop shit

I'm always in the top shit

Box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip

How many a' them coulda did it with finnesse?

Now everybody like, ""She really is the best.""

You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess

Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest

Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong

Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong

Chinese ink on, Siamese links on

Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong

Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, I'm King Kong

This is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong

In my kingdom wit my Timbs on

How many championships? What? Six rings on



They need rappers like me, they need rappers like me

So they can get on their fucking keyboards and make me the bad guy, Chun-Li



Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been conned

Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on

I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed

He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song

I-I-I been on, bitch, you been conned

Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on

Ayo, I been off, Lara been Croft

Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off



I come alive, I, I'm always sky high

Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle

I come alive, I, I'm always sky high

Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle

I need a Mai Tai, so fuckin' sci-fi

Gimee the password to the fuckin' wifi"

I'm on point, I know what I'm doin'

Way too smart to act like I'm stupid

I get my advice from Mike Rubin

I'm not by myself, my whole crew lit

Next year Chanel, I put her in that new print

It is what it is, I can't make no excuses

I hit the whole group—do that make me a groupie?

We went city to city in bulletproofs

You can't run with my gang, they'll bully you

Been had switches, I know what them fullys do

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
He said he came from Jamaica
He owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers

Gave up on love, f*cking with them heart breakers

But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers

He was mixed with a couple things

Ball like a couple rings

Bricks in the condo

And grams to Sing Sing

Left arm, baby mother tatted

5-year bid up north when they ratted

Anyway, I felt him, helped him

Put him on lock, seat-belt him

Took him out to Belgium, welcome

B*tches this pretty, that's seldom

This box better than the box he was held in

I'm Momma Dee in that order

I call him Daddy like daughters

He like it when I get drunk

But I like it when he be sober

That's top of the toppa

I never f*ck with beginners

I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers

I'm in the zone



[Hook: Nicki Minaj]

They holler at me but it's you

You, this ain't high school

Me, and my crew

We can slide through

Give it to you whenever you want

Whip it whenever you want

Baby, it's yours

Anywhere, everywhere

Baby it's your world

Ain't it?

Baby it's your world

Ain't it?



[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

She got a n*gga at home

And one on the side

Best friend is a dyke, they f*cked around a few times

Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight

I tell her make me some money, she tell me make her a wife

I tell her, ""B*tch, you crazy.

F*ck wrong with you?""

And excuse my french, but I'm a long kisser

And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'

And I say, ""What about them n*ggas?""

She say, ""What about them n*ggas?""

You right, what you doing tonight?

Put on something tight

Don't judge me, I get life

She love me like a brother

But f*ck me like a husband

Pussy like a oven

Too hot to put my tongue in

All I had to do is rub it

The genie out the bottle

Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles

She tell me that's it's mine

I tell her stop lying

Mine and who else?

She say worry 'bout yourself

Lil Tune



[Hook: Nicki Minaj]

They holler at me but its you

You, this ain't high school

Me, and my crew

We can slide through

Give it to you whenever you want

Whip it whenever you want

Baby, it's yours

Anywhere, everywhere

Baby it's your world

Ain't it?

Baby it's your world

Ain't it?



[Outro: Nicki Minaj]

I know you want it, boy

I see you tryin'

Just keep on pushin'

I'ma let you slide in

Just close your eyes and

This horizon

It's ready, come get you some

In this very moment I slay Goliath with the sling

Wheezy on top and that nigga ain't even home

Fuck it, me and Nicki may get married today

And all the bitches that be

You and all them white girls, party of five

Are we drinking a little more alcohol, you decide

I can't believe we really made it

I'm partly surprised

I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now

Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car

And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?

You see the fleet of all the new things

Cop cars with the loose change

All white like I move things

Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change

Like a motherfucker

New flow, I got a dozen of 'em

I don't trust you, you are undercover

I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other

Talkin' filets with the truffle butter

Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it

Yeah, they all get what they desire from it

What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it



Yo, thinkin' out loud

I must have about a milli on me right now

And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record

I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record

Man, this a 65 million single sold

I ain't gotta compete with a single soul

I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll

Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul

Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?

You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now?

Uhh, do you hear me?

I can't let a wack nigga, get near me

I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me

I ain't never need a man, to take care of me

Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this

I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist

Your whole style and approach, I invented

And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it



Uh, thinkin' out loud

I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile

LOL to the bank checkin' my account

Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account

Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy

Cuddle buddies on the low

You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning

Cause she gonna say ""I know""

Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet

I'll put my leg on the tub

Girl, this my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it

But bitch you dancing with the stars

I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important

I bought some cocaine, you can snort it

She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet

Suck the white off like chocolate

I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless

Smallest regardless, largest in charge and born in New Orleans

Get killed for Jordans

Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunech and Barbie

Paintin' their own pictures then they crop me in

But I will remain where the top begins

'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line

I am not a girl that could ever be defined

I am not fly, I am levitation, I represent an entire generation

I hear the criticism loud and clear, that is how I know that the time is near

See we become alive in the time of fear, and I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare

Cry my eyes out for days upon days

Such a heavy burden placed upon me

But when you go hard your nays become yays

Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly, To fly



Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it

I came to win

Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it

I came to win



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly, To fly"

I done been through realest blocks, pushed the hardest sixes

Keep a couple killers that don't care how far them licks is, look

Bitches act like they want action

Heard they want action

Bitch, we ain't duckin' no action

I'm 'bout to give them that traction, send a distraction

Then I'ma line 'em like fractions

Took a brеak, I let 'em live, look it all 'еm eatin'

But these bitches gon' be mad once I call this meetin'

'Cause they gotta move around once the queen is queenin'

'Bout to put out all this crack 'cause my fiends is fiendin', uh

I put these bitches on gang, they should be kissin' my feet

I tried to give 'em some press, they tried to say it was beef

It’s Nicki M, such a little gem

Bitches wanna be around me, but I do not fuck with them

All these diamonds on me flooded, I hope nobody gets stuck

If I pull out the Ferrari, then my shooters in the truck

I could still go to my hood, they know my body is good

Two million dollars to party in Saudi Arabian clubs

Poppin' them things to go up and smokin' Los Angeles bud

These bitches bitin' like Joe, shout out to Kamala though (Yuh)

It's them weak bars thinkin' that she dissin' for me

I graded your homework, bitch, it's incomplete

If you was tryna be my son, then mission complete

I'm the final level bitch they on a mission to beat

It's like Covid when the goat is on the track, the whole game stop

But I ain't playin' with these bitches, this ain't GameStop

If Barbie in the buildin', then she with a gangsta

He ain't gon' hesitate if I tell him to shank sumn

Just put a beauty parlor in my guest house

You mean the pink Lamborghini? That's at the next house

Fuck him so good I got him walkin' with his chest out

I wish these bitches wanted more talent and less clout

I fall back, and just give them some space

'Cause when you already won, what the fuck is a race?

Look at them fuckin' for raps, oh, what a disgrace

I put that on A-rod, none of you bitches is safe (Uh)

Make his dick get hard soon as I brush up, but we tryna be subtle

Whole city go up when the bitch touch down like them niggas in a huddle

Sex game still cold it's on igloo

Head game slicker than little miss Gorilla Glue

He tryna eat it up, I said, come and get it, boo

While I count a mill', jigga what? jigga who?"

And it's never less than like 4 niggas

4 wings and some french fries

Hot sauce and ketchup nigga

He telling and he hiding but real niggas will still catch a nigga

I cop Raris, don't test drive em

Home theaters, can't best buy em

These niggas that I roll with don't let a single thing get by em

King pins and them drug lords

Chi-town no gun lords

Broke bitches that talk shit, now them the bitches I stunt for

Malcom X daughter came at me

Looking niggas ain't happy

Rolled out with some Latin Kings and some eses and them plain khakis

Smack bitches, no smack cam

Whole fist, no back hand

Pop pussy on a hand stand, they sucking dick like a band camp

Call Web and then call Nitty

Queens niggas in it's all hoodies

Kidnapping and then rob niggas

Call D-rock for a biggie

Pussy ass lil rap niggas

I fucked with real trap niggas

Pop star, icon but I send niggas come snatch niggas

I'm with EBK, you on EBT

Got a black nine, call it BET

School niggas get a GED

Got a money fetish, imma fly to Venice

Got a big house I can play some tennis

Lil herb, what's good

I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good



Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide

When it's drama time

Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin

Leave his loved ones all traumatized

One-fifty I'm really wit' it

I'll drop his ass and then forget it

I'm the man round my side of town

Might see a bitch and forget I hit it



I'm a young nigga I be getting money

Take your bitch from you

And these niggas get no respect

I'mma stay 100 till im 6 under

Matter fact I gotta keep it 150

For every nigga that's gon come with me

I'm on rock block with a new semi and a blue Bentley and do 160

Smoke a lot a of weed

Like fuck gimmicks, put a dutch in me

Got a 40 on me, I don't trust any

And if any nigga ever try to end me

I'mma die shooting praying God forgive me

You too busy hating you can't get no paper, why are ya'll so silly?

Straight killers I can call so many

I don't love no bitches but my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki

I'm in Hollywood came from Kingston Food

Shorties standing in the streets with tools

Where I'm from we don't play no games

Ain't no April fools, you will make the news

Where I hang we don't say no names

If you talk to cop I stay away from you

Keep your mouth shut in them investigations

You'll be out the station in a day or two

Dedication and a little patience

Leave the domination on my way to greatness

Don't put yourself up in a situation

Putting my relations in your conversations

Shoot a opposition with no hesitation

You get my position nigga better take it

Know some young bulls from a while back tryna leave the game but they never made it

I got old shit, killing your shit

On a couple tracks I just never played it

Pussy nigga you don't want war I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis

Pussy nigga you don't want war I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis

What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot, bust me down?

You the same clown nigga that was runnin' me down?

Now you all up in the sauce 'cause you wanna be down?

I said, rule number one to be a boss ass bitch

Never let a clown nigga try to play you

If he play you then, rule number two

Fuck his best friends then make 'em yes-men

And get a dick pic and then you press send

And send a red heart and send a kissy face

And tell him that his friends love how your pussy taste

And that's rule three, I'm the school T

My wrist look like I am a jewel thief

But that's just 'cause I am a boss bitch

Now macaroni cheese and grill my swordfish

I be out in Cali watchin' back my Christmas vids

Every time I fuck 'em, yes, I tell him this is his

Looked down at it, and I said, ""This is big""

Man, my game so cold I said, ""This is rigged""

Best flow in the game, this is not a lie

Tell 'em bitches, cross they Ts and dot they I

I-I-I-I-I-I-I came back, bitches' flows still boring

I said, ""Damn, man, go back to whoring""

You know I still lead the league in scoring

You know I'm still bad and I'm still foreign

I-I-I'ma give bitches time to get hot

Chill out at the game, New York Knickerbock'

If they actually got bars, they could rock

But if not, I'ma destroy chicks a lot, oh

But on the real, I'm in album mode

Just dropped this freestyle 'fore these files get old

When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound

When I come back, they better not make a sound



I hear you

When I'm back on the prowl

You bitches better have my money

'Cause I'm coming for you, ooh, ooh



Uh, okay, I order rich bitch sauce

Rich bitch cold, got a rich bitch cough

Which bitch want it? I'll go rich bitch off

'Cause you know my style gettin' bit, ripped off

When I'm at the restaurant, rich bitch sauce

You know why? (Go hard)

And I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper

And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators

Young Money



If you could, you would get rid of me

Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?

But I won't let you get to me (To me)

You should already figure I'ma go hard

If you was as real as me

You would never let another girl sit in your throne

I done put the chokehold

Now they screamin', ""Nicki leave me alone!""

I am (Hard), I'm still (Hard) the one to beat (Go hard)

Ain't in a rush for mainstream, I am the streets (Oh)

I am getting it in until the end

I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)

Go hard



Carter called, lemme get the car key

You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie

Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (Man down)

Hit him on the walkie-talkie

Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in

My name ring bells, bitch buzz me in (Bzzz)

And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)

Or a real, real bad lesbian

Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine

Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign

Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy

And I always keep the jammy

In the trunk or in the Lamby

Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good

I don't wanna hear what you would, what you could

I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)

Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)

Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)

Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up

Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up

Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up

And I'm tellin' President Carter, he picked a winner

Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)

These birds all fly south, in the winter

Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?

You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?

I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle

Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)

I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle

(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) No muzzle

Bitches is softer than Al Dente

Cut from a different kente

Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei

So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter

Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner

This is for my gentlemen, in button-ups, and khakis

This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki

This is for my niggas, wheelie-in' them Kawasakis

Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees (Ackees)

Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky (Cocky)

Winter Wonderland, is on my hand, it's kind of rocky (Rocky)

I am Nicki (Nicki), Minaj or Lewinski (Lewinski)

Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed (6-speed)

Write my own raps, I gotta go, I gotta get me (Gotta get me)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

I’m still looking around for my competition (Oh)

I am gettin' it in until the end

I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)

Go hard



From slap-and-cry you start to die

So I must go harder

Gotta make these bitches know me

Just like Bobby know water

Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp

But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip

And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip

So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip

If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship

Check out how them bitches just run on my dick

And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch

I still got that bitch cum on my lips

If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip

And if you got money, don't come on my strip

I wear that metal, no Olympic

But I can still make you tumble and flip

You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'

They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'

Your girlfriend her decision is split

'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic

They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich

That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip

Young Money dungeon bitch, my swagger is punchin' bitch

And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun ""Gunovich""

Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit

Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch

Ha-ha

Yeah (Guitar)





Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



Wish you could get rid of Young Money

Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?

But I won't let you get to me (To me)

You should already figure I'ma go hard

If you was as real as me you would never

Let another girl sit in your throne

I done put the chokehold on

Now they screamin', ""Nicki leave me alone""

I am (Hard), I will (Hard), I gots to win (Go hard)

I'm still lookin' around for my competition

But on another note let's have sex in my dorm

And I'm a' make you beg cause you look pretty when you begging

Double cup love, you the one I lean on

Feelin' for a fix then you should really get your feen on

Get it from the back and make your fucking bra strap pop

All up in yah slot till a nigga hit the jackpot

Mad, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him,

Everywhere I go, I get ""Hi, nice to meet you."",

Bxtches know I beast this,

I'm the fashionistist.

And they know I stay around the white like a groom,

Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom.

I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high on my own supply,

Yellin' ""Rasta, alright! "" when I'm ridin' by,

See I used to be the wife of a king,

Back when I was smugglin' them things in the bing.

Now that I'm a boss bxtch,

It's a win-win,

Come to Mr. Chow's or meet me in Chin-Chin,

Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring -

Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding.

Get d- get down, get down, get down down,

Mad they done tapped my trio,

Begged my skio,

Heard the bxtch lyin' like Leo.

Anyway, I'm the ninja,

Kawasaki blazin',

In a kimono, ""Konichiwa"" to the Asians.

I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son,

So all of that yellin' in the street soon done.

Cus if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin',

The young Chaka Khan, yes - I am every woman.

And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in,

Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin')

Yea yea uh huh
She said FUCK FENDI, but I think she was playin

She call herself Lewinsky, that mean she give him brain

She tryna be like Little Kim, her picture looks the same

Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens right?

And what's her nationality, she chinese right?

I mean she OK, but she ain't ALL DAT

She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch FALL BACK!

See I'm a hater, I go hard... listen let's begin

You know her last name Minaj, she a lesbian

And she ain't never comin out, look at currency

But every time she do a interview you know I run and see

She get me so sick it make me vomit

That's why I spend my time online leaving comments

And you know that I got some more haters with me

Might hit up thisis50... MTV... hit up BET

Tell 'em pretty pretty please don't play Nicki



[Chorus: x2]

Still I rise

Still I fight

Still I might crack a smile

Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!

One day you'll remeber this

One day when we reminisce

Nothing I do ever is, good enough for the music biz



For u, for u



[Verse 2:]

Bitches is like crabs in a bucket

You see a bad bitch gettin shine, you shoud love it

Cause everytime a door opens for me dat means you

Just gotta a better opportunity to do you

They don't understand these labels look at numbers it's statistics

I lose, u lose, mines just legastic

Anyway, real bitches listen wen I'm speakin

Cause if nicki win, then all of ya'll gettin meetings (kyea)

Ask LA Reid, ask Jay

Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say

Ask Craig Common, you can ask chris

Lady when you're done, just salute bad bitch

Only underground bitch around that's duckin the paparatzi

In and outta town, be swirvin the mazeratzi

Stay around the white like a nazi

Pussy pppoppin on my poppers so the cops see... BITCHES!



[Chorus: x2]

Still I rise

Still I fight

Still I might crack a smile

She invites me to the condo

Uh-oh—wifey's in Chicago (oh, oh)

My side piece—but she's also someone's wife

So time we spend is borrowed

But it's our moment

Right here, fuck tomorrow

'Cause moments like these are to die for

And she's clear all

Nice and easy as hair when I'm bleaching it blonde

So we got that lightning in a bottle



She's tipsy, I'm sober

So she gets a chip on her shoulder

Sits on the sofa, I go to load a

Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on

She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is so fucked

Think that shit's got pneumonia.""

I told her, ""Bitch, now, just hold up.""

That's why rap needs a doctor

Our genre's lymph nodes are swollen up

It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis

'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts

That's why Tribe is so vital—we need Q-Tip for the culture

Speed it up a little bit

You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight

I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache

And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake

I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate

Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate

I wanna make it acapella, wait, I gotta set a date

With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate

And re-develop hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place, now

Take a ride with me, hop into my time machine

I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed

Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media right in the behind

I'm a human encyclopedia

I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast

And you're never gonna reach these heights, they're just too high to reach it

I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest

You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek

And you might wanna decide to cheat

'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek

Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?

Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat

If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet

And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it

Better not use me as your topic, anybody who brings me up, duck it

Let me keep it one hundred, two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion

The queen and her husband, last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

The mandem want this just for dial

Inna the dance, we a go skin out time now

I wanna come out your suicide door

Yeah, on the real, I'm these bitches' idol

Gotta be dumb to make me your rival

'Cause I'm too powerful, yeah, you not powerful

But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours

B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O

Step your banks up like you're moving that ya-yo

Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay though

Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speaking

Ain't no fat nigga telling me what he ain't eating

This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang

She invites me to the condo

Uh-oh—wifey's in Chicago (oh, oh)

My side piece—but she's also someone's wife

So time we spend is borrowed

But it's our moment

Right here, fuck tomorrow

'Cause moments like these are to die for

And she's clear all

Nice and easy as hair when I'm bleaching it blonde

So we got that lightning in a bottle



She's tipsy, I'm sober

So she gets a chip on her shoulder

Sits on the sofa, I go to load a

Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on

She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is so fucked

Think that shit's got pneumonia.""

I told her, ""Bitch, now, just hold up.""

That's why rap needs a doctor

Our genre's lymph nodes are swollen up

It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis

'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts

That's why Tribe is so vital—we need Q-Tip for the culture

Speed it up a little bit

You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight

I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache

And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake

I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate

Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate

I wanna make it acapella, wait, I gotta set a date

With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate

And re-develop hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place, now

Take a ride with me, hop into my time machine

I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed

Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media right in the behind

I'm a human encyclopedia

I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast

And you're never gonna reach these heights, they're just too high to reach it

I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest

You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek

And you might wanna decide to cheat

'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek

Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?

Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat

If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet

And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it

Better not use me as your topic, anybody who brings me up, duck it

Let me keep it one hundred, two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion

The queen and her husband, last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah



Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (oh, oh)

Whatever you want, you can have from me (oh, oh)

Told 'em I'd get you back

I know you sittin' there just thinkin' 'bout who did you that

I am who did you that

You trippin', did you pack?

Can't post on Nicki block unless you sellin' Nicki crack

Here, take a Nicki pack, check out this Nicki act

Nicki this, Nicki that, all these bitches piggyback

Nicki back, ah, ah, ah back

Ah, ah, ah back

How dare all them mirror my style

The mandem want this just for dial

Inna the dance, we a go skin out time now

I wanna come out your suicide door

Yeah, on the real, I'm these bitches' idol

Gotta be dumb to make me your rival

'Cause I'm too powerful, yeah, you not powerful

So say your prayers 'cause you 'bout to die slow

I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel

And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful

As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool

Cherish these days, man do they go quick

Just yesterday, I swear it was '06

Ten years ago, that's when you proposed

I look down, yes I suppose



All things go, all things go

All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone

While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls

So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong

Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young

We keep goin', we go, we go, we go

We wake back up and do it all again

We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

When all is said and done, look at what we've become

I just want you to know, that I did it for you



I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence

His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him

Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?

Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same

Even though they know that I love him

Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me

And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me

I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me



All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone

We keep goin', we go, we go, we go

We wake back up and do it all again

We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

When all is said and done, look at what we've become

I just want you to know, that I did it for you



Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business

I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas

Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me

Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness

I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact

I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that

She never understands, why I'm so overprotective

The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected

I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""

My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute

So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them

It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him

And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him

And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him

Who knows, who knows, so I lied

I thought eventually, you would let me go

That was my insecurities, and my ego

Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw

Miss the way we kiss miss, the d o

Man it was good while it lasted

That shit wasn't real, it was magic

If it was a record, it would have been classic

But fuck you though, orgasmic



This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling

Stalling the truth, who knew what you'd

Do If I let you in, my mama ain't raised no fool

I am not your usual typical type

Who would protect me if I never hide?

Not cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya

I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya

Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow

I have both and an empire also

Keep gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole

Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow

Let that ho ho, let that ho know, he in love with that coco

Why these bitches don't never be learnin'?

You bitches will never get what I be earnin'

I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban

Ain't gotta rely on top 40,

I am a Rap legend, just go ask the Kings of Rap,

Who is the Queen and things of that

Nature? Look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a laser

Drippin' on that work, trippin' off that perc

Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work

Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got B's

Stingin' with the Queen Bey and we be whippin' all of that D

Worried 'bout if my butt's fake,worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight

These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight

When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late

Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update

Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too

Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to

Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is

These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz

Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with

I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet

Let it soak in, like seasonin'

And tell 'em bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson



Raise every bottle and cup in the sky

Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July

Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight

Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet

Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only

Rich niggas only, independent bitches only

Boss niggas only, thick bitches only

I got my real niggas here by my side, only



I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man

But when that's over, then I'm first in line

And the other day in her Maybach

I thought god damn, this is the perfect time

We had just come from that video

You know LA traffic, how the city slow

She was sitting down on that big butt

But I was still staring at the titties though

Yeah, lowkey it may be high key

I been peeped that you like me, you know

Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?

I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly

I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree

Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW, yeah

Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you

Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable

Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable

Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you

The NBA players fuck with you,the bad-ass bitches

Doing makeup and hair fuck with you

Oh, that's cause I believe in something, I stand for it

And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up

So I can plan for it......(Pinkprint, AYE!)

I never fucked Nicki and that's fucked up

If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up

Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right

Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life

That's another story, I'm no story teller

I piss greatness, like gold is yellow

All my goons so overzealous

I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca

Calendar say I got money for days

I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways

My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave

They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard

My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade

Don't have my money? Take mothers instead

You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth

Then I make you burp, boy,treat beef like sirloin

I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns

So think about your son and daughter rooms

Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns

Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms

This shit is krazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga

That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga

Blood gang, take the B out behavior, my nigga

For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off

I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off

Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't

Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles

16 in a clip, one in the chamber

17 Ward bullywith 17 bullets

My story is how I went from ""poor me""

To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

Soon as you out the nigga's lifes is when they start to miss you

They see you doing good now it's kinda hard to diss you

Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you

Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you

But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when I'm causing a frenzy

So I pop pills for them, cop cribs in the Hills for them



Pills and potions

We're overdosing

I'm angry but I still love you

Pills and potions

We're overdosing

Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love

I still love, I still love

I still love, I still love

I still love, I still love

I still love, I still love



I get high off your memory

I get high off your memory

I get high off your memory

And your time will be fine

And you time...



I still love, I still love

I still love, I still love

I still love, I still love

I still love, I still love

I still love, I still love"

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved

But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies



You could never make eye contact

Everything you got was based off of my contacts

You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat

Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap

You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it

You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it

Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it

I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it

I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'

Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public

Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating

Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

But there was something that I should've asked all along

I'mma ask on the song



Do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

And I knew better than to look in your eyes

They only pretend you would be mine

And you know how you made me believe

You had me caught in every web that you weaved

But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies



I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies

I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace

But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate

I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend

What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend

When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em

If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some

What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?

I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me

I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony

This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

But there was something that I should've asked, all along

I'mma ask on the song



So does she know I've been in that bed before?

A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth

If I was just another girl

Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you

There's one thing I need to know

So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself



Do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

And I knew better than to look in your eyes

They only pretend you would be mine

And you know how you made me believe

You had me caught in every web that you weaved

But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies"

Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were the one
who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark



And now the people are talking,

the people are saying that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano

The people are talking, the people are saying

that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano

So play on, play on, play on

Play on, play on, play on

Play on, play on, play on

Am I being a fool?

Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths

What do I see in you?

Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do

Cause I keep thinking you were

the one who came to take claim of this heart

Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

LOL to the bank checkin' my account

Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy

Cuddle buddies on the low

You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning

Cause she gonna say ""I know""

Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet

I'll put my leg on the tub

Girl, this my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it

But bitch you dancing with the stars

I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important

I bought some cocaine, you can snort it

She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet

Suck the white off like chocolate

I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel

And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful

As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool

Cherish these days, man do they go quick

Just yesterday, I swear it was '06

Ten years ago, that's when you proposed

I look down, yes I suppose



All things go, all things go

All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone

While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls

So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong

Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young

We keep goin', we go, we go, we go

We wake back up and do it all again

We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

When all is said and done, look at what we've become

I just want you to know, that I did it for you



I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence

His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him

Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?

Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same

Even though they know that I love him

Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me

And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me

I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me



All things go, all things go

All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone

While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls

So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong

Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young

We keep goin', we go, we go, we go

We wake back up and do it all again

We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

When all is said and done, look at what we've become

I just want you to know, that I did it for you



Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business

I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas

Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me

Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness

I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact

I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that

She never understands, why I'm so overprotective

The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected

I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""

My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute

So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them

It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him

And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him

And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him

Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint

Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

Even though I said I didn't need you I lied I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said don't touch me I lied, I lied

I can't fall for you, can't give my all to you

I can't let you think that Imma let the game stall for you

Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me

You said you thought you was ready and I said let's see

But I ain't mean that, I need some fucking proof

Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose

You just a heart breaker, won't let you break mine

Cause I'll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines



I lied

Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you

Who knows, who knows, so I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh



Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied

I thought eventually, you would let me go

That was my insecurities, and my ego

Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw

Miss the way we kiss miss, the d o

Man it was good while it lasted

That shit wasn't real, it was magic

If it was a record, it would have been classic

But fuck you though, orgasmic



This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling

Stalling the truth, who knew what you'd

Do If I let you in, my mama ain't raised no fool

I am not your usual typical type

Who would protect me if I never hide?

Falling so fast I am afraid of you



So I lied, I lied, I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

I lied, ooh baby, oooh

Cause what if I let myself go with you"

Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves

You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs

Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs



Are you alone? Do you need someone?

Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?

Thousand words don't change a thing

Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?



Where did you go? Couldn't see

I was too busy

Could've just said no

Where would you go? I think I know

Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul

Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll

Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control

Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes

Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious

Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?

Another slap to the face, another uppercut

I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya

Not cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya

I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya

But is you stayin' or goin'?

I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it

How come you never show it?

All this love you speak of

All I want is to love and to be loved

(To love and to be loved)



I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win

And I'm coming undone

Cause the tears don't end



Where did you go? Couldn't see

I was too busy

Could've just said no

Where would you go? I think I know

Yeah, that was a setup, for a punchline on duct tape

Worried 'bout if my butt's fake,worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight

These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight

When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late

Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update

Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too

Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to

Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is

These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz

Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with

I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet

But when that's over, then I'm first in line

And the other day in her Maybach

I thought god damn, this is the perfect time

We had just come from that video

You know LA traffic, how the city slow

She was sitting down on that big butt

But I was still staring at the titties though

Yeah, lowkey it may be high key

I been peeped that you like me, you know

Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?

I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly

I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree

Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW, yeah

Don't have my money? Take mothers instead

You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth

Then I make you burp, boy,treat beef like sirloin

I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns

So think about your son and daughter rooms

Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns

Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms

This shit is krazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga

That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga

Blood gang, take the B out behavior, my nigga

For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off

I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved

But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies



You could never make eye contact

Everything you got was based off of my contacts

You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat

Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap

You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it

You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it

Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it

I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it

I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'

Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public

Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating

Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

But there was something that I should've asked all along

I'mma ask on the song



Do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

And I knew better than to look in your eyes

They only pretend you would be mine

And you know how you made me believe

You had me caught in every web that you weaved

But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies



I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies

I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace

But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate

I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend

What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend

When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em

If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some

What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?

I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me

I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony

This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

But there was something that I should've asked, all along

I'mma ask on the song



So does she know I've been in that bed before?

A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth

If I was just another girl

Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you

There's one thing I need to know

So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself



Do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

And I knew better than to look in your eyes

They only pretend you would be mine

And you know how you made me believe

You had me caught in every web that you weaved

But do you ever think of me when you lie?

You ain't gotta leave

You ain't gotta leave

But you can't sleep with me



Every time I come to fuck with you

You make up all the rules

You ought to do it

Just because our car's moving

Are you in my fucking corner for real?

Oh, are you plotting to kill?

I tell you just how I feel

But you never hear

Oh, why you take it like that?

Now you wanna leave and never come back

I don't control you, I ain't never say that

Can't give up on you, baby, we go way back



Put you in a room

You ain't gotta leave

You ain't gotta leave

But you can't sleep with me



Every time I try to fuck with you

Nothing ain't ever enough for you

And I had all this hope for you

But all you do is open wounds

I could be fucking with them other niggas

I know you ain't them other niggas

I don't fuck with a lot of bitches

Just my real bitches

Why you keep talking about it, you keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off

Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy if she could cut her wrist off

I ain't gonna lie, no I ain't gonna lie like it was just his fault

But I know if a nigga lose me, then nigga, oohwee, that's his loss, young nigga



Put you in a room

You ain't gotta leave

You ain't gotta leave

But you can't sleep with me

Put you in a room

You ain't gotta leave

You ain't gotta leave

But you can't sleep with me"

I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel

And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful

As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool

Cherish these days, man do they go quick

Just yesterday, I swear it was '06

Ten years ago, that's when you proposed

I look down, yes I suppose



All things go, all things go

All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone

While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls

So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong

Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young

We keep goin', we go, we go, we go

We wake back up and do it all again

We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

When all is said and done, look at what we've become

I just want you to know, that I did it for you



I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence

His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him

Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?

Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same

Even though they know that I love him

Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me

And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me

I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me



All things go, all things go

All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone

While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls

So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong

Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young

We keep goin', we go, we go, we go

We wake back up and do it all again

We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

When all is said and done, look at what we've become

I just want you to know, that I did it for you



Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business

I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas

Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me

Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness

I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact

I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that

She never understands, why I'm so overprotective

The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected

I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""

My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute

So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them

It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him

And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him

And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him

Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint

Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint



All things go, all things go

All things go, all things go"

Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me

You said you thought you was ready and I said let's see

But I ain't mean that, I need some fucking proof

Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose

You just a heart breaker, won't let you break mine

Cause I'll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines



I lied

Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you

Who knows, who knows, so I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh



Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied

I thought eventually, you would let me go

That was my insecurities, and my ego

Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw

Miss the way we kiss miss, the d o

Man it was good while it lasted

That shit wasn't real, it was magic

If it was a record, it would have been classic

But fuck you though, orgasmic



This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling

Stalling the truth, who knew what you'd

Do If I let you in, my mama ain't raised no fool

I am not your usual typical type

Who would protect me if I never hide?

Falling so fast I am afraid of you



So I lied, I lied, I lied

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged

We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves

You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs

Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs



Are you alone? Do you need someone?

Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?

Thousand words don't change a thing

Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll

Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control

Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes

Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious

Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?

Another slap to the face, another uppercut

I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya

Not cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya

I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya

But is you stayin' or goin'?

I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it

How come you never show it?

All this love you speak of

All I want is to love and to be loved

(To love and to be loved)



I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win

And I'm coming undone

Cause the tears don't end

Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too

Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to

But you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya

You ain't never have a bitch understand you

Most of them wanna use you when they ran through

I just wanna be somebody, that can add to

Your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too

I just wanna listen

When you leave I say ""damn, I fucking miss him""

I just wanna be your vixen

Give you something real wet, to put your lips in

I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you

Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure



I just wanna be your favorite

I just wanna be your favorite

I just wanna be your favorite

I just wanna be your favorite

Won't you let me be your favorite?



Ayo, I just wanna be your first go to

Do you like a real one s'posed to, livin' bi-coastal

Scoop me in the truck, late night, wanna humble

Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown

You could put your gun down, you could have fun now

You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down

Run through the clubs with the baddest

Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters

And if they workin' where the bag is

Gotta lot of bags, but we never got baggage

Went to Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance

I'mma have you coming in my palace

London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status

Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure



I just wanna be your favorite

I just wanna be your favorite

I just wanna be your favorite

I just wanna be your favorite

Won't you let me be your favorite?

Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game

But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist, by the ring on that

Somebody had it on lockdown

The moral of the story not to speak on that

She on the team, shorty mine now

And we don't ever ever ever make love

And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""

Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh

Rahmeek, I'mma have to tell the truth if I speak

Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day

You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge

Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs

(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)

I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me

I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me

He could tell that I was wifey material

He was liking my style in my videos

I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz

So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo

Cause its too much, and its too clutch

Who wants rumors of the two of us

But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind

But what if I met the one and your wasting your time

But you waited

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved

But do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies



You could never make eye contact

Everything you got was based off of my contacts

You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat

Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap

You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it

You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it

Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it

I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it

I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'

Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public

Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating

Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

But there was something that I should've asked all along

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies

I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace

But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate

I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend

What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend

When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em

If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some

What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?

I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me

I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony

This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

But there was something that I should've asked, all along

I'mma ask on the song



So does she know I've been in that bed before?

A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth

If I was just another girl

Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you

There's one thing I need to know

So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself



Do you ever think of me when you lie?

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

And I knew better than to look in your eyes

They only pretend you would be mine

And you know how you made me believe

Made a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy

I went back to the projects, and 2 mill in mercedes

I get hit from your lady, have her bill me later

I'm on school with the hustle, just gave rihanna my pager

Heart break hotel, I'm in the 8 rise suite

Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking play off seat

Know that boy busy balling I like to play all week

Monday night with the raw, I'm Vince McMahon with a beat

Power slamming them hammers I get you handle for free

So where the fuck is her manners, she gives brain while I tweet

DM, in the BM, you see 'em, the bucket, you love it

Motherfuckers on my dick, suck it



I am your leader, yes I am your leader

You're not a believer, suck a big dick

I am your leader, yes I am your leader

You're not a believer, suck a big dick



See the car is European but god imported from Tokyo

Looking like a shark, the nose call it Pinocchio

Well off, wealthy, L.V. logo

Middle of July but the wrist on snowfloor

Only do the aspens, y'all got a poking nose

I'm sunny and you must sun

Ride the whip, 5 on the hip, live with the pies got 9 for the flip

High with a bitch, she cry for the dick, oh my know why...get

Now I need an aspirin

She said you're only Cam'ron,

Girlfriend you don't know Cam'ron from nowhere

So don't go tampering, you're just a nail I hammer

Never girl that's on my camera

My name you cannot slender, adult girl watch your manners

She run and tell her mother, ""I think I love him nana.""

Because you sat up on my lap? Nah, I ain't Santa.

They call me pot piper, OJ no glove, I knife her.

Never be a lifer, even do right 'cause

Why would I fight her? Don't even like her



I am your leader, yes I am your leader

You're not a believer, suck a big dick

I am your leader, yes I am your leader

You're not a believer, suck a big dick"

Is it me or did I just put these rap bitches on the map again

You mad cause I'm at the grammy's with the Vatican

You in the booth, but I'm who you be channelling

Why they never bring your name up at the panel then?

You need money, I got mine

More knots than Eric from Basketball wives (yaaa dig?)

I remember when I used to stay with Erica

Label transferred 20 million to Comerica

It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character

Young T.O. nigga, either riding range

The Ferarri top down, screaming, ?Money ain't a thang!?

Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change

Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know!

Making hits in three acre cribs

Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs

I made a couple stars outta basic chicks

Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish

Having good times, making good money

Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me

I make them do the splits for a rap

Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at

Stay putting on for the town, may I?

What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high

Over a mil in three weeks, yeah I did it like a champ

Momma taught me pride, yeah she did it with the stamps

Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo

Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global

Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going

What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?

Don't let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace

Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate

I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23

I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me

This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ

Cause that's where a nigga from murder on replay

My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermuda, you can see me on a yacht

Blasting pop, little not, I ain't greedy

I'm back to thugging, bitches

Back to making them kiss other bitches

My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister

I just despise your desire to be different

My ten year old plan is just one year to finish

My list with like this, first thing to souther

The difference in p-ssy, white, Black, Latin and other

Here's a man who clearly isn't basic

Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness

Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life

Happily ever after

You want me to leave then take it down

You see me come out of England at dawn

You say the pattern come from Kingston

Trinidad Trinidad, my island



I see you in here dancing

Your preview is quite romantic

I envy your perfect kind of life

Who knew you'd be so sexy?

I think you're quite fantastic

Screw your flaws

You're perfect in my eyes



And maybe I'm naive for loving you

You're a cheat and a liar

But tonight you're everything I desire



You beautiful sinner

I love your wicked heart

Beautiful sinner

It's such a work of art



I didn't know that bad could look so good

You are the type of bad that feels so good

Beautiful sinner



I bet you're heart of stone

Living in your world alone

I hope you let me in tonight

They want me to beware

You're dangerous, I don't care

I can't wait to have you in my arms



And maybe I'm naive for loving you

You're a cheat and a liar

But tonight you're everything I desire



You beautiful sinner

I love your wicked heart

Beautiful sinner

It's such a work of art



I didn't know that bad could look so good

You are the type of bad that feels so good

You're a beautiful sinner



Maybe your the master of disguise

And you are put it on and

Your really the saint that could walk

Are you here to save me from the crowd?

If you are then baby take me now



You beautiful sinner

I love your wicked heart

Beautiful sinner

It's such a work of art



I didn't know that bad could look so good

You are the type of bad that feels so good

You're a beautiful sinner"

Whenever date, pretty summer day
I ready my mail one you would say
Would be okay, come one mine
I never knew you would lie to me

Took everything, from inside of me

You're so lone in the doorway

But before you walk away



Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes

So that I always will remember

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever

I'll be over here, you'll be other there

I might show it to ya but I really don't care

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever



I used to think when we re-unite

I'd be your wife, in a real life

I thought that you'd come back for me

And you would take me away

I never knew, only as a teen

You'd re-appear, only in my dreams

You're so lone in the doorway

But before you walk away



Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes

So that I always will remember

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever

I'll be over here, you'll be other there

I might show it to ya but I really don't care

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever



This is, my, last, cry

Is this the only way?

This is my own prison

I'm frozen in time, in time, in time



Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes

So that I always will remember

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever

I'll be over here, you'll be other there

I might show it to ya but I really don't care

I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told

And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow



You piece of shit, you broke me down

Thought you said you, would hold me down

But I can see it in your eyes that your blinded by the flashing lights

And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

Gave up on love, f*cking with them heart breakers

But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers

He was mixed with a couple things

Ball like a couple rings

Bricks in the condo

And grams to Sing Sing

Left arm, baby mother tatted

5-year bid up north when they ratted

Anyway, I felt him, helped him

Put him on lock, seat-belt him

Took him out to Belgium, welcome

B*tches this pretty, that's seldom

This box better than the box he was held in

I'm Momma Dee in that order

I call him Daddy like daughters

He like it when I get drunk

But I like it when he be sober

That's top of the toppa

I never f*ck with beginners

I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers

I'm in the zone



[Hook: Nicki Minaj]

They holler at me but it's you

You, this ain't high school

Me, and my crew

We can slide through

Give it to you whenever you want

Whip it whenever you want

Baby, it's yours

Anywhere, everywhere

Baby it's your world

Ain't it?

Baby it's your world

Ain't it?



[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

She got a n*gga at home

And one on the side

Best friend is a dyke, they f*cked around a few times

Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight

I tell her make me some money, she tell me make her a wife

I tell her, ""B*tch, you crazy.

F*ck wrong with you?""

And excuse my french, but I'm a long kisser

And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'

And I say, ""What about them n*ggas?""

She say, ""What about them n*ggas?""

You right, what you doing tonight?

Put on something tight

Don't judge me, I get life

She love me like a brother

But f*ck me like a husband

Pussy like a oven

Too hot to put my tongue in

All I had to do is rub it

The genie out the bottle

Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles

She tell me that's it's mine

I tell her stop lying

Mine and who else?

She say worry 'bout yourself

Lil Tune



[Hook: Nicki Minaj]

They holler at me but its you

You, this ain't high school

Me, and my crew

We can slide through

Give it to you whenever you want

Whip it whenever you want

Baby, it's yours

Anywhere, everywhere

Baby it's your world

Ain't it?

Baby it's your world

Ain't it?



[Outro: Nicki Minaj]

I know you want it, boy

I see you tryin'

Just keep on pushin'

I'ma let you slide in

Just close your eyes and

This horizon

It's ready, come get you some

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

Wear that boy

Let me get the most expensive car, and let me steer that boy

Real big pretty-titty, shut down every city

If you want the kid kitty, gotta get the key from me

All new everything, plus pay the rent for me

If we in the wilderness, n*ggas pitch the tent for me

Tent for me, tent for me

Get me bodied, long hair no make-up doing Pilates

Most n*ggas don't step on my damn Zanottis

All them b*tches my sons but who's the Daddy?

I graduate with honors

I ball, 'Nead O'Connor

I did a Freestyle, then I got a shoutout from Obam'er

Yes, yes, I am ill

I go in for the kill

Hoes is my sons

Birth control, I am on the pill

What I gotta do? What I gotta do to 'em?

Step up in the club, everybody like who them?

Girls, girls, me and my girls

What you done did?

I need some referrals

Motherf*ckers know I'm the sh*t, legit

Where we shot it was a lot of different agriculture's

So I laugh at hopefuls

Nicki pop, only thing thats pop is my endorsement

I, f-ck around I have to go and reinforce the glock



Bang my sh-t bang, it bang bang

Bang my sh-t bang it bang bang



Is it me or did I just put these rap bitches on the map again

You mad cause I'm at the grammy's with the Vatican

You in the booth, but I'm who you be channelling

Why they never bring your name up at the panel then?

Hottest MC's, top five!

You need money, I got mine

More knots than Eric from Basketball wives (yaaa dig?)



Bang my sh-t bang, it bang bang

Bang my sh-t bang it bang bang



I couldn't do your TV show I needed ten more mill

Not 10 on the back, I need 10 on signing

Give that sh-t to a wash up, bitch I'm winning

If I had a label I would never sign you hoes

Yes I really do mean it's Barbie bitch

Ask Mattel, they auction my Barbie bitch

Bitches ain't half cut up crack up in the stash

Yeah, okay

We made it to America

I remember when I used to stay with Erica

Label transferred 20 million to Comerica

It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character

Young T.O. nigga, either riding range

The Ferarri top down, screaming, ?Money ain't a thang!?

Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change

Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know!

Making hits in three acre cribs

Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs

I made a couple stars outta basic chicks

Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish

Having good times, making good money

Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me

I make them do the splits for a rap

Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at

Stay putting on for the town, may I?

What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high

Over a mil in three weeks, yeah I did it like a champ

Momma taught me pride, yeah she did it with the stamps

Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo

Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global

Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going

What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?

Don't let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace

Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate

I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23

I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me

This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ

Cause that's where a nigga from murder on replay

My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermuda, you can see me on a yacht

Blasting pop, little not, I ain't greedy

I'm back to thugging, bitches

Back to making them kiss other bitches

My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister

I just despise your desire to be different

My ten year old plan is just one year to finish

My list with like this, first thing to souther

The difference in p-ssy, white, Black, Latin and other

Here's a man who clearly isn't basic

Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness

Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life

Happily ever after

Whenever date, pretty summer day
I ready my mail one you would say
Would be okay, come one mine
I never knew you would lie to me

Took everything, from inside of me

You're so lone in the doorway

But before you walk away



Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes

So that I always will remember

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever

I'll be over here, you'll be other there

I might show it to ya but I really don't care

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever



I used to think when we re-unite

I'd be your wife, in a real life

I thought that you'd come back for me

And you would take me away

I never knew, only as a teen

You'd re-appear, only in my dreams

You're so lone in the doorway

But before you walk away



Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes

So that I always will remember

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever

I'll be over here, you'll be other there

I might show it to ya but I really don't care

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever



This is, my, last, cry

Is this the only way?

This is my own prison

I'm frozen in time, in time, in time



Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes

So that I always will remember

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever

I'll be over here, you'll be other there

I might show it to ya but I really don't care

Frozen in time, always be mine

Baby boy you'll be young forever"

You let me beg for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so I pray you burn in hell, and you never find the ocean
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby

I hope your fire, fire burns, baby

I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told

And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow



You piece of shit, you broke me down

Thought you said you, would hold me down

But I can see it in your eyes that your blinded by the flashing lights

And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by



I hope your fire, fire burns, baby

I hope your fire, fire burns, baby

I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told

And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

It was back in '07 did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVD's made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doin' but I put on the cape
Now it's which world tour should I go on today
See you told me I would lose but I one

I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun

Caus' bitches couldn't take what was in me Australia, Sydney

Might run up in Disney out in LA with' Lindsay

Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah

Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime

Everything I tried to teach 'em they gon' see it in time

Tell them bitches get a stick I'm done leadin' the blind

Got two shows tonight that's Brooklyn and Dallas

Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace

Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial

That's Young Money, Cash Money yeah I'm Universal



[Hook:]

I hope they comin' for me because the top is lonely

What the fuck they gon' say [x2]

I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it [x2]

I'm the best, best, best, best [x2]

I'm the best



[Verse 2:]

I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch

Now I'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house

You could never understand why I grind like I do

Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do

Caus' even when my daddy was on crack I was crack

Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track

I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards

I just walk up out the door all the girl will applaud

All the girls will commend as long as they understand

That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win

Caus' before they could begin, you told them it was the end

But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in

Got two bones to pick I'm a only choose one

You might get addressed on the second album

Which means you can breathe 'till I muthafuckin say so

To all my bad bitches: I could see your halo

It's ok, It's ok

Long as you know, long as you know

Long as you muthafuckas know I'm the be-be-be-be-be-best"

Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'

So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?

Yeah, I said it, has-been

Hang it up, flatscreen

Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma

I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine

I got bars, Xenocin

I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt

And I'll kick that hoe, punt

Forced trauma, blunt

You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front

You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it

Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with

I ain't into S and M, but my whip's off the chain

A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame

Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain

An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame

You don't like it then peel off, bitch

Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut

So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off

Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off

Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod

Quit hollerin' ?Why, God?? He ain't got shit to do with it

Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad

I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra

Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch

Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad

With fake tits and a bad dye job

Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad

So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod

And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed

Set up the camera and pissed twice on her

Look, two pees and a tripod!

The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?

Kick it back in its face, my God

It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd

But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots

Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me

Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it

You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon

You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end

I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic



(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?

Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?

Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho

Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow

(Ni-ni-ni) ?Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot?

Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?

Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot

Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top

I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'

I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'

Overseas, church, Vatican

You at a stand, still, mannequin

You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?

I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite

And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike

Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite

I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's

Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs

I call the play, now do you see why?

These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)



A-a-a-a-all you li'l faggots can suck it

No home, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets

And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend

Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if

You have the same passion that I have

Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass

You assdicks had gastric bypass

Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass

And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)

Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony

'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass

You know what time it is, so why ask?

It's (high class) meets (white trash)

Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put your number two's in the air if you did it on 'em

All these bitches is my sons

And I'm go and get some bibs for 'em

A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em

If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em

Let me shake it off

I just signed a couple deals I might break you off

And we ain't making up I don't need a mediator

Just let them bums blow steam, radiator



[Chorus]



This stone is flawless F1

I keep shooters up top in the F1

A lot of bad bitches beggin' me to eff one

But I'm a eat them rap bitches when the chef come

Throw some fresh one's

More talent in my mother fuckin left thumb

She ain't a Nicki fan then the bitch deaf dumb

You a'int my son you my mother fuckin step-son



[Chorus]



All these bitches is my sons

And I ain't talking 'bout Phoenix

Bitch I get money so I do's what I pleases

I live where the mother fuckin pools and the trees is

Broke bitches so crusty (disgust me)

Gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty

Trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff' b

Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me



I'm the terminator bitch talk slick I am have to terminate her

these little nappy headed hoes need a perminator

You my seed I spray you with germinator

Move back bugs matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub

If you could turn back time, Cher

You used the be here but now you gone Nair

how do you do that shyt
how do you
how do you

how do you

how do you

how do you



you let me win,

you let me ride

you let me rock

you let me slide

And when they lookin, you let me hide

Defend my honor, protect my pride

The good advice, I always hated

But lookin back, it made me greater

You always told me, forget the haters

Just get my money, just get my weight up

Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'

It's like you got it, down to a science

Why am I tryin'? No you ain't buyin

I tried to fight it, back with defiance

You make me laugh, you make me hoarse

From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you

Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you

Why are you speakin', when no one asked you?



you see right through me.

how do you do that shyt

how do you do that shyt

how do you do that shyt

how do you

how do you do that shyt

how do you do that shyt

how do you

how do you

how do you

how do you

how do you



What are we doing, could you see through me,

cause you say Nicki and I say who me?

and you say no you, and I say screw you,

then you start dressing and you start leaving,

and I start crying, and I start screaming,

the heavy breathin', but, what's the reason,

always get the reaction you wanted,

I'm actually fronting, I'm asking you something

YO, answer this question, class is in session,

tired of letting passive aggression, control my mind,

capture my soul, OK, you're right just let it go,

OK you got it, it's in the can, before I played it,

you knew my hand, you can turn a free throw to a goal,

Nigga got the peep hole to my soul



you see right through me.

how do you do that shyt

how do you do that shyt

how do you do that shyt

how do you

you see right through me.

Stop!

Stop!

Won't you just stop looking through me 'cause I can't take it, no I can't take it



you see right through me.

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly
I wish today it will rain all day

Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away

Trying to forgive you for abandoning me

Praying but I think I'm still an angel away

Angel away, yeah strange in a way

Maybe that is why I chase strangers away

They got their guns out aiming at me

But I become near when they aiming at me

Me, me, me against them

Me against enemies, me against friends

Somehow they both seem to become one

A sea full of sharks and they all see blood

They start coming and I start rising

Must be surprising, I'm just summising

Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher

More fire



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

To fly



Everybody wanna try to box me in

Suffocating everytime it locks me in

Paint they own pictures than they crop me in

But I will remain where the top begins

Cause I am not a word, I am not a line

I am not a girl that can every be defined

I am not fly, I am levitation

I represent an entire generation

I hear the criticism loud and clear

That is how I know that the time is near

So we become alive in a time of fear

And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare

Cry my eyes out for days upon days

Such a heavy burden placed upon me

But when you go hard your nay's become yay's

Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

To fly



Get ready for it

Get ready for it

Get ready for it

I came to win

Get ready for it

Get ready for it

Get ready for it



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

To fly"

I am no longer trying to survive,
I believe that life is a prize,
But to live doesn't mean you're alive,
Don't worry bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire it's my empire

And yes I call the shots I am the umpire

I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire, vampire

And this very moment I'm king

This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,

This very moment I bring

Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring,

And I will retire with the crown, Yes!

No I'm not lucky I'm blessed, Yes!

Clap for the heavyweight champ, Me!

But I couldn't do it all alone, We!

Young Money raised me, grew up out in Paisley

Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy

Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me

Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me

Ain't being cocky we just vindicated, best believe that when were done

This moment will be syndicated, I don't know this night just reminds me

Of everything that they deprived me of, kuhh!

Ppppp put ya drinks up, it's a celebration every time we link up

We done did everything they can think of

Greatness is what we wanna brink up.



I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive

Doin talkin, practice all these bitches just aiming to please

Shoutout to the CEO 500 degrees

Shoutout to the OVO where we set for T's, oooow

Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental

This supposed to be our year we ain't get the memo

Young King, pay me in gold

40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll

These niggas be droppin songs they ain't even cold

Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!

Yeaah, be very afraid these other rappers getting bodied and carried away

Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today

And now you bitches that be hatin can catch a bouquet, oww

Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five

Are we drinking a lil more I can hardly decide

I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear

Daaam, this one for the books, man!

I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!

I'm really tryna make it more than what it is, cause everybody dies but not everybody lives!



I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive



This is my moment, I waited all my life I can tell it's time

Drifting away I'm one with the sunsets, I have become alive.

All these haters mad because I'm so established.

They know I'm a beast, yeah I'm a f**king savage

Haters you can kill yourself.

In my space shuttle and I'm not coming down

I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone

Sometimes it's just me and all my bottles all alone

I ain't coming back this time.

Yep, the sun done

Came up, but we still up in dungeon

The DunDun

Yep, in London

Competition, why yes I would love some

How the f**k they get mad cause they run done.

Mad cause I'm getting money in abundance

Man I can't even count all of these hundreds

Duffle bag every time I go to SunTrust

I leave the rest just to collect interest

I mean interest

F**k my nemesis

Exclamation... just for emphasis

And I don't sympathize, cause you a simple b***h

I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple sh*t

And put the iron to your face you old wrinkled b***h



We just had to kill it

We on the radio hotter than a skillet

We in the club making party people holla

Money in the bank we be getting top dollar

I'm a big baller,

You a little smaller

Step up to my level, you need to grow a little taller

I'm shot caller

Get up off my collar

You a Chihuahua

I'm a Rottweiler



[Bridge]

I can't believe it, it's so amazing.

I can't believe it, this beat is banging.

I can't believe it, it's so amazing.

I can't believe it, I can't believe i-it.

Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me

You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly

I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations

Because I got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em

And the lights even brighter, baby stand next to my fire

Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah

'Rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire?

Where we flying, they can't find us all them broke days behind us

Then I'm a taste it, then I'm a blaze it

His past is a fac, his stats is amaze

And the only thing that change is the price of gold

Even in the afterlife I'm a fight your soul

Cause the second time around I'll be twice as grown

So do you take me to be who I am?

To have and to hold till death do us part

Cause if not it's just best we both part

Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?

You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe

Then you say I won't survive if I leave

But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve

I no longer need your attention, at ease

I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back
But its like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin tell me you ain't 6 feet under
And tell me that you coming back that you just to a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake

In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge

Cuz it was you who talked me down from jumpin off the ledge

Your earings bamboo, your long nails too

Your BMW everytime you came through

You was the braveheart

You stole wayne heart

You never switched it up

You played the same part

But I needed to grow

And I needed to know

That there were somethings inside of me that I need to show

So I just deaded you

Left you in all black

But damn old nicki

Please call back



You told me you'd come when I needed you

And you said it so sweetly I believed you 

But I'm standing here calling I cant see you

But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that



Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour

Money, fame and power

Cuz if so that will forever go down my lamest hour

I shoulda kept you with me gettin at them nameless cowards

There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess

I had to make them changes, I hope you understood

You see for every bad, I did a ton of good

But you was underground, and I was mainstream

I live the life now, that we would daydream

My only wish is you come enjoy it with me

Get on them conference calls, go meet them lawyers with me

The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it

But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit

But its still fuck the media

They ridiculed you, never believed in ya

They just deaded you

Left you in all black

But dear old nicki

Please call back



You told me youd come when I needed you

And you said it so sweetly I believed you 

But I'm standing here calling I cant see you

But I am holding you, holding you,holding you to that

I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot



I get it in though, no sexual innuendo

Nobody that I could just depend on

Until I touch down in the end zone

And then they come out like roaches

P-p-pecking away like vultures

But little did they know, distribute the payroll

Pick out the outfit, pick out the single

Sadly, I'm so business savvy

Similar protocol but the tidbits vary

Never been like me, ain't never been like this

My flow's a crisis they screamin' high pitch

Gun cock, pause,and I'm well aware of the gun laws

Tell 'em, that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes

Headed to the top; dot org



Yeah this is my last chance, last chance

Yeah this is my last chance

And shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

And I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot



All the days of my life I have been waiting for this time

Could you believe now it's right before my eyes

Anybody trying to stop me better not fuck with me this time

Shoot, I'm ready to shoot into the sky



Yea this is my last chance ohhh, last chance ohhh

Yea this is my last chance, then shoot

I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)

I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)

I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)

I'm ready to shooooot

I'm ready to shoot



Only one chance one bullet in the gun

This is my life and I only got one yea

The safety's off and I put on her

Ohh stick em up, stick em up

Ready to shoot"

Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod

Quit hollerin' ?Why, God?? He ain't got shit to do with it

Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad

I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra

Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch

Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad

With fake tits and a bad dye job

Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad

So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod

And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed

Set up the camera and pissed twice on her

Look, two pees and a tripod!

Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass

All the girls will commend as long as they understand

That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win

Caus' before they could begin, you told them it was the end

But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in

Got two bones to pick I'm a only choose one

You might get addressed on the second album

Which means you can breathe 'till I muthafuckin say so

To all my bad bitches: I could see your halo

I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's

Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs

I call the play, now do you see why?

These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli

These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)



A-a-a-a-all you li'l faggots can suck it

No home, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets

And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend

Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if

You have the same passion that I have

Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass

You assdicks had gastric bypass

Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass

And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)

Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony

'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass

You know what time it is, so why ask?

When Shady and Nicki's worlds class

It's (high class) meets (white trash)

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Grown men! Grown men!

Stop it, stop it!

You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!

You and this boy Slim Shady!

What's goin' on?

They'll lock you away!

They'll put you in a jail cell!

I promise!

Take your mother's warning, Roman

Pleaaaaaaase

Back to bed! Run along!

Let's go! Come on!

Wash your mouth out with soap, boys

All these bitches is my sons

And I'm go and get some bibs for 'em

A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em

If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em

Let me shake it off

I just signed a couple deals I might break you off

And we ain't making up I don't need a mediator

Just let them bums blow steam, radiator



[Chorus]



This stone is flawless F1

I keep shooters up top in the F1

A lot of bad bitches beggin' me to eff one

But I'm a eat them rap bitches when the chef come

Throw some fresh one's

More talent in my mother fuckin left thumb

She ain't a Nicki fan then the bitch deaf dumb

You a'int my son you my mother fuckin step-son



[Chorus]



All these bitches is my sons

And I ain't talking 'bout Phoenix

Bitch I get money so I do's what I pleases

I live where the mother fuckin pools and the trees is

Broke bitches so crusty (disgust me)

Gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty

Trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff' b

Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me



I'm the terminator bitch talk slick I am have to terminate her

these little nappy headed hoes need a perminator

You my seed I spray you with germinator

Move back bugs matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub

If you could turn back time, Cher

You used the be here but now you gone Nair

you let me win,

you let me ride

you let me rock

you let me slide

And when they lookin, you let me hide

Defend my honor, protect my pride

The good advice, I always hated

But lookin back, it made me greater

You always told me, forget the haters

Just get my money, just get my weight up

Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'

It's like you got it, down to a science

Why am I tryin'? No you ain't buyin

I tried to fight it, back with defiance

You make me laugh, you make me hoarse

From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you

Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you

Why are you speakin', when no one asked you?



you see right through me.

how do you do that shyt

What are we doing, could you see through me,

cause you say Nicki and I say who me?

and you say no you, and I say screw you,

then you start dressing and you start leaving,

and I start crying, and I start screaming,

the heavy breathin', but, what's the reason,

always get the reaction you wanted,

I'm actually fronting, I'm asking you something

YO, answer this question, class is in session,

tired of letting passive aggression, control my mind,

capture my soul, OK, you're right just let it go,

OK you got it, it's in the can, before I played it,

you knew my hand, you can turn a free throw to a goal,

Nigga got the peep hole to my soul



you see right through me.

how do you do that shyt

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly
I wish today it will rain all day

Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away

Trying to forgive you for abandoning me

Praying but I think I'm still an angel away

Angel away, yeah strange in a way

Maybe that is why I chase strangers away

They got their guns out aiming at me

But I become near when they aiming at me

Me, me, me against them

Me against enemies, me against friends

Somehow they both seem to become one

A sea full of sharks and they all see blood

They start coming and I start rising

Must be surprising, I'm just summising

Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher

More fire



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

To fly



Everybody wanna try to box me in

Suffocating everytime it locks me in

Paint they own pictures than they crop me in

But I will remain where the top begins

Cause I am not a word, I am not a line

I am not a girl that can every be defined

I am not fly, I am levitation

I represent an entire generation

I hear the criticism loud and clear

That is how I know that the time is near

So we become alive in a time of fear

And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare

Cry my eyes out for days upon days

Such a heavy burden placed upon me

But when you go hard your nay's become yay's

Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

To fly



Get ready for it

Get ready for it

Get ready for it

I came to win

Get ready for it

Get ready for it

Get ready for it



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

I am no longer trying to survive,
I believe that life is a prize,
But to live doesn't mean you're alive,
Don't worry bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire it's my empire

And yes I call the shots I am the umpire

I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire, vampire

And this very moment I'm king

This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,

This very moment I bring

Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring,

And I will retire with the crown, Yes!

No I'm not lucky I'm blessed, Yes!

Clap for the heavyweight champ, Me!

But I couldn't do it all alone, We!

Young Money raised me, grew up out in Paisley

Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy

Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me

Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me

Ain't being cocky we just vindicated, best believe that when were done

This moment will be syndicated, I don't know this night just reminds me

Of everything that they deprived me of, kuhh!

Ppppp put ya drinks up, it's a celebration every time we link up

We done did everything they can think of

Greatness is what we wanna brink up.



I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive



I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive



Yeahh

Yeaahh

Yeahh, ugh

What I tell 'em hoes bow bow bow to me, drop down to ya knees

Young Money the Mafia that's word to Lil Cease

I'm in The Dominican Big Papi Ortiz

Doin talkin, practice all these bitches just aiming to please

Shoutout to the CEO 500 degrees

Shoutout to the OVO where we set for T's, oooow

Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental

This supposed to be our year we ain't get the memo

Young King, pay me in gold

40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll

These niggas be droppin songs they ain't even cold

Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!

Yeaah, be very afraid these other rappers getting bodied and carried away

Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today

And now you bitches that be hatin can catch a bouquet, oww

Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five

Are we drinking a lil more I can hardly decide

I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear

Daaam, this one for the books, man!

I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!

I'm really tryna make it more than what it is, cause everybody dies but not everybody lives!



I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive



I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive



This is my moment, I waited all my life I can tell it's time

Drifting away I'm one with the sunsets, I have become alive.



I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

They know I'm a beast, yeah I'm a f**king savage

Yep, the sun done

Came up, but we still up in dungeon

The DunDun

Yep, in London

Competition, why yes I would love some

How the f**k they get mad cause they run done.

Mad cause I'm getting money in abundance

Man I can't even count all of these hundreds

Duffle bag every time I go to SunTrust

I leave the rest just to collect interest

I mean interest

F**k my nemesis

Exclamation... just for emphasis

And I don't sympathize, cause you a simple b***h

I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple sh*t

And put the iron to your face you old wrinkled b***h



We just had to kill it

We on the radio hotter than a skillet

We in the club making party people holla

Money in the bank we be getting top dollar

I'm a big baller,

You a little smaller

Step up to my level, you need to grow a little taller

I'm shot caller

Get up off my collar

You a Chihuahua

I'm a Rottweiler

I can't believe it, it's so amazing.

I can't believe it, this beat is banging.

And the only thing that change is the price of gold

Cause the second time around I'll be twice as grown

So do you take me to be who I am?

To have and to hold till death do us part

Cause if not it's just best we both part

Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?

You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe

Then you say I won't survive if I leave

But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve

I no longer need your attention, at ease

I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back
But its like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin tell me you ain't 6 feet under
And tell me that you coming back that you just to a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake

In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge

Cuz it was you who talked me down from jumpin off the ledge

Your earings bamboo, your long nails too

Your BMW everytime you came through

You was the braveheart

You stole wayne heart

You never switched it up

You played the same part

But I needed to grow

And I needed to know

That there were somethings inside of me that I need to show

So I just deaded you

Left you in all black

But damn old nicki

Please call back



You told me you'd come when I needed you

And you said it so sweetly I believed you 

But I'm standing here calling I cant see you

But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that



Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour

Money, fame and power

Cuz if so that will forever go down my lamest hour

I shoulda kept you with me gettin at them nameless cowards

There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess

I had to make them changes, I hope you understood

You see for every bad, I did a ton of good

But you was underground, and I was mainstream

I live the life now, that we would daydream

My only wish is you come enjoy it with me

Get on them conference calls, go meet them lawyers with me

The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it

But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit

But its still fuck the media

They ridiculed you, never believed in ya

They just deaded you

Left you in all black

But dear old nicki

Please call back



You told me youd come when I needed you

And you said it so sweetly I believed you 

But I'm standing here calling I cant see you

But I am holding you, holding you,holding you to that



And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you

Oh yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you

I get it in though, no sexual innuendo

Nobody that I could just depend on

Until I touch down in the end zone

And then they come out like roaches

P-p-pecking away like vultures

But little did they know, distribute the payroll

Pick out the outfit, pick out the single

Sadly, I'm so business savvy

Similar protocol but the tidbits vary

Never been like me, ain't never been like this

Gun cock, pause,and I'm well aware of the gun laws

Tell 'em, that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes

And now we murderers, because we kill time

I knock her lights out and she still shine

I hate to see her go, but I'd love to watch her leave

But I keep her runnin' back and forth like a soccer team

Cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve

Young Money thieves, steal your hearts with ease

I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby

Girl I gotta watch my back cause I'm not just anybody

I see them standing in line, just to get beside her

I let her see the aston or let the rest surprise her

She watchin' that oxygen, I'm watchin' ESPN

But when that show ends, she all in my skin lotion

No emotions, roller coasting like back, forth, hold it (Hold it [x4])

She pause like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to

Take this photo if you for me, she said don't you ever show this

I'm too loyal and too focused, to be losing and be hopeless

When I spoke this, she rejoiced it

Said your words get me open, so I closed it

Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment



[Verse 6: Jae Millz]

She ain't got a man but she's not alone

Miss independent yea she got her own

Hey gorgoues, umm, I mean flawless, well

You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it

Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with

You li'l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock

I am a movie, camera block

You outta work, I know it's tough

I ain't into S and M, but my whip's off the chain

A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame

Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain

An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame

You don't like it then peel off, bitch

Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut

So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off

Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off

Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod

Quit hollerin' ?Why, God?? He ain't got shit to do with it

Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad

I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra

Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch

Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad

With fake tits and a bad dye job

Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad

So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod

And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed

Set up the camera and pissed twice on her

Look, two pees and a tripod!

The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?

Kick it back in its face, my God

It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd

But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

The wo-world is my punchin' bag and

If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots

Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me

Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it

Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon

You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end

I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic



(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?

Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?

Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho

Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow

(Ni-ni-ni) ?Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot?

Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?

Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot

Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top

I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'

I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'

Overseas, church, Vatican

You at a stand, still, mannequin

You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?

I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite

And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike

Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite

I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's

Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs

I call the play, now do you see why?

These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli

These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)



A-a-a-a-all you li'l faggots can suck it

No home, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets

And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend

Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if

You have the same passion that I have

Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass

You assdicks had gastric bypass

Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass

And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)

Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony

'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass

You know what time it is, so why ask?

It was back in '07 did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVD's made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doin' but I put on the cape
Now it's which world tour should I go on today
See you told me I would lose but I one

I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun

Caus' bitches couldn't take what was in me Australia, Sydney

Might run up in Disney out in LA with' Lindsay

Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah

Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime

Everything I tried to teach 'em they gon' see it in time

Tell them bitches get a stick I'm done leadin' the blind

Got two shows tonight that's Brooklyn and Dallas

Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace

Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial

That's Young Money, Cash Money yeah I'm Universal



[Hook:]

I hope they comin' for me because the top is lonely

What the fuck they gon' say [x2]

I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it [x2]

I'm the best, best, best, best [x2]

I'm the best



[Verse 2:]

I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch

Now I'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house

You could never understand why I grind like I do

Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do

Caus' even when my daddy was on crack I was crack

Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track

I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards

I just walk up out the door all the girl will applaud

All the girls will commend as long as they understand

That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win

Caus' before they could begin, you told them it was the end

But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in

Got two bones to pick I'm a only choose one

You might get addressed on the second album

Which means you can breathe 'till I muthafuckin say so

To all my bad bitches: I could see your halo



[Hook x2]



It's ok, It's ok

Long as you know, long as you know

Long as you muthafuckas know I'm the be-be-be-be-be-best"

All these bitches is my sons

And I'm go and get some bibs for 'em

A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em

If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em

Let me shake it off

I just signed a couple deals I might break you off

And we ain't making up I don't need a mediator

Just let them bums blow steam, radiator



[Chorus]



This stone is flawless F1

I keep shooters up top in the F1

A lot of bad bitches beggin' me to eff one

But I'm a eat them rap bitches when the chef come

Throw some fresh one's

More talent in my mother fuckin left thumb

She ain't a Nicki fan then the bitch deaf dumb

You a'int my son you my mother fuckin step-son



[Chorus]



All these bitches is my sons

And I ain't talking 'bout Phoenix

Bitch I get money so I do's what I pleases

I live where the mother fuckin pools and the trees is

Broke bitches so crusty (disgust me)

Gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty

Trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff' b

Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me



I'm the terminator bitch talk slick I am have to terminate her

these little nappy headed hoes need a perminator

You my seed I spray you with germinator

Move back bugs matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub

If you could turn back time, Cher

You used the be here but now you gone Nair

how do you

how do you

how do you



you let me win,

you let me ride

you let me rock

you let me slide

And when they lookin, you let me hide

Defend my honor, protect my pride

The good advice, I always hated

But lookin back, it made me greater

You always told me, forget the haters

Just get my money, just get my weight up

Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'

It's like you got it, down to a science

Why am I tryin'? No you ain't buyin

I tried to fight it, back with defiance

You make me laugh, you make me hoarse

From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you

Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you

Why are you speakin', when no one asked you?



you see right through me.

how do you do that shyt

What are we doing, could you see through me,

cause you say Nicki and I say who me?

and you say no you, and I say screw you,

then you start dressing and you start leaving,

and I start crying, and I start screaming,

the heavy breathin', but, what's the reason,

always get the reaction you wanted,

I'm actually fronting, I'm asking you something

YO, answer this question, class is in session,

tired of letting passive aggression, control my mind,

capture my soul, OK, you're right just let it go,

OK you got it, it's in the can, before I played it,

you knew my hand, you can turn a free throw to a goal,

Nigga got the peep hole to my soul



you see right through me.

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly
I wish today it will rain all day

Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away

Trying to forgive you for abandoning me

Praying but I think I'm still an angel away

Angel away, yeah strange in a way

Maybe that is why I chase strangers away

They got their guns out aiming at me

But I become near when they aiming at me

Me, me, me against them

Me against enemies, me against friends

Somehow they both seem to become one

A sea full of sharks and they all see blood

They start coming and I start rising

Must be surprising, I'm just summising

Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher

More fire



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

To fly



Everybody wanna try to box me in

Suffocating everytime it locks me in

Paint they own pictures than they crop me in

But I will remain where the top begins

Cause I am not a word, I am not a line

I am not a girl that can every be defined

I am not fly, I am levitation

I represent an entire generation

I hear the criticism loud and clear

That is how I know that the time is near

So we become alive in a time of fear

And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare

Cry my eyes out for days upon days

Such a heavy burden placed upon me

But when you go hard your nay's become yay's

Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's



I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

To fly

To fly



Get ready for it

Get ready for it

Get ready for it

I came to win

Get ready for it

Get ready for it

Get ready for it

And yes I call the shots I am the umpire

I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire, vampire

And this very moment I'm king

This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,

This very moment I bring

Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring,

And I will retire with the crown, Yes!

Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy

Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me

Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me

Ain't being cocky we just vindicated, best believe that when were done

This moment will be syndicated, I don't know this night just reminds me

Of everything that they deprived me of, kuhh!

Ppppp put ya drinks up, it's a celebration every time we link up

We done did everything they can think of

Greatness is what we wanna brink up.

Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!

Yeaah, be very afraid these other rappers getting bodied and carried away

Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today

And now you bitches that be hatin can catch a bouquet, oww

Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five

Are we drinking a lil more I can hardly decide

I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear

Daaam, this one for the books, man!

I'm really tryna make it more than what it is, cause everybody dies but not everybody lives!

Exclamation... just for emphasis

And I don't sympathize, cause you a simple b***h

I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple sh*t

And put the iron to your face you old wrinkled b***h



We just had to kill it

We on the radio hotter than a skillet

We in the club making party people holla

Money in the bank we be getting top dollar

I'm a big baller,

You a little smaller

Step up to my level, you need to grow a little taller

I'm shot caller

Get up off my collar

I can't believe it, it's so amazing.

I can't believe it, this beat is banging.

I can't believe it, it's so amazing.

I can't believe it, I can't believe i-it.



[Chorus]

(Hey) Check It Out (x10)

Check It Out (x3)"

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
Feels like I'm

How could it me, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league

Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me

You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly

I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations

Because I got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em

The contract is on but I am the addendum

So wh-where my dawgs at, Randy

Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy

Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy

Go against me nooooow, I dare you, Bambi

Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show

I ain't even detonate the palms and the arsenal

Before the storm comes the calm

Hope you can take the heat like LeBron,

Ahh, ha hahahaha ha

I'm the best now, anybody where's the money? shit invest now

Soccer mom needs to organize a pep rall'

You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel

Motherfuckers ain't ready, they neva been

As long as I am in the game, you'll never win

I'm on that different type of high, heroin

Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!



I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing



Ugh, yea, ugh this is the moment grab your Kodak

While I'm flying with a flow that is the greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan

And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder

And the lights even brighter, baby stand next to my fire

Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah

'Rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire?

Where we flying, they can't find us all them broke days behind us

I just took your whole life and redesigned it

I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld

I think without makeup, you still bad as hell

I'm a grab your waist then, I'm a grab your face and

Then I'm a taste it, then I'm a blaze it

Hello all my bad girls, this just in yeezy hurt the beat

Like he f-ked her best friend and she let him back in

And he just did it again, He crazy, he blazin, he off the deep end

I'm blazin' I'm flagrant, I'm crazy I'm saying

Too much for the World so they Abbreviate him

His past is a fac, his stats is amaze

Her dress is just per' uhh

Prada coloured babes

It obvi' we the ishh and I'm rolling with my bricks

So real you so trill. baby everything legit

How you feel, they say we crazed cause our styles so diff'

They be jail when we in the mag looking magnif'

As if I ain't used Magnums on your favourite bad bitch

Fuck these background niggas I was tryna adlib

Add this, we blazin'

Nicki what you think, I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks

Ah hahahaha



I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing



It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'm a just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des

And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces

Yeah that'll make me transform to Hercules



Here I am, Here I am, so tell me, cause I am

Here I am, Here I am, so tell me, cause I am

Here I am, Here I am, so tell me, cause I am



I swear to God, man, everything in life is old

And the only thing that change is the price of gold

Even in the afterlife I'm a fight your soul

Cause the second time around I'll be twice as grown

So do you take me to be who I am?

To have and to hold till death do us part

Cause if not it's just best we both part

Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?

You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe

Then you say I won't survive if I leave

But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve

I no longer need your attention, at ease



It's a joke, it's a game,

Why am I still keeping score?

I'm in pain, I'm ashamed

I'm a woman, hear me roar



It's a joke, it's a game,

Why am I still keeping score?

I'm in pain, I'm ashamed

I'm a woman, hear me roar



Now it's a joke, it's a game,

Why am I still keeping score?

I'm in pain, I'm ashamed

I'm a woman, hear me roar



It's a joke, it's a game,

Why am I still keeping score?

I'm in pain, I'm ashamed

I'm a woman, hear me roar"
39TvzjT5Yq64u45BU30irD,Dear Old Nicki,3LJhoYn4nnHmvPRO3ppbsl,Pink Friday,0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh,Nicki Minaj,233386,,2010,"Maybe you died cuz everybody ask me where you at
I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back
But its like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin tell me you ain't 6 feet under
And tell me that you coming back that you just to a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake

In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge

Cuz it was you who talked me down from jumpin off the ledge

Your earings bamboo, your long nails too

Your BMW everytime you came through

You was the braveheart

You stole wayne heart

You never switched it up

You played the same part

But I needed to grow

And I needed to know

That there were somethings inside of me that I need to show

So I just deaded you

Left you in all black

But damn old nicki

Please call back



You told me you'd come when I needed you

And you said it so sweetly I believed you 

But I'm standing here calling I cant see you

But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that



Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour

Money, fame and power

Cuz if so that will forever go down my lamest hour

I shoulda kept you with me gettin at them nameless cowards

There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess

I had to make them changes, I hope you understood

You see for every bad, I did a ton of good

But you was underground, and I was mainstream

I live the life now, that we would daydream

My only wish is you come enjoy it with me

Get on them conference calls, go meet them lawyers with me

The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it

But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit

But its still fuck the media

They ridiculed you, never believed in ya

They just deaded you

Left you in all black

But dear old nicki

Please call back



You told me youd come when I needed you

And you said it so sweetly I believed you 

But I'm standing here calling I cant see you

But I am holding you, holding you,holding you to that



And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you

Oh yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you

And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you

To that



And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you

Oh yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you

And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you

To that"

But my vision ends with the apple on the tree

'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him

Cause I'm the one like I'm Tracy McGrady

Jump shot with a stupid ass aim
Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my cross-over wins the last game
And it's ill right?
Switched up the flow but it's still right

Go back to that, yeah I still might

I'mma just do me when it feel right

You could bring it anyday, natural bad-ass; NBA

That's my initials; that's why officials

Don't blow the whistle, bang, bang, the pistol

And I'm bossy, can't keep these hoes up off me

Damn the flow nasty coffee, don't

You do like the pope and cross me



Yeah this is my last chance, last chance

Yeah this is my last chance

And shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

And I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot



I get it in though, no sexual innuendo

Nobody that I could just depend on

Until I touch down in the end zone

And then they come out like roaches

P-p-pecking away like vultures

But little did they know, distribute the payroll

Pick out the outfit, pick out the single

Sadly, I'm so business savvy

Similar protocol but the tidbits vary

Never been like me, ain't never been like this

My flow's a crisis they screamin' high pitch

Gun cock, pause,and I'm well aware of the gun laws

Tell 'em, that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes

Headed to the top; dot org



Yeah this is my last chance, last chance

Yeah this is my last chance

And shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

And I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot



All the days of my life I have been waiting for this time

Could you believe now it's right before my eyes

Anybody trying to stop me better not fuck with me this time

Shoot, I'm ready to shoot into the sky



Yea this is my last chance ohhh, last chance ohhh

Yea this is my last chance, then shoot

I'm ready to shoot

I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)

I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)

I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)

I'm ready to shooooot

I'm ready to shoot



Only one chance one bullet in the gun

This is my life and I only got one yea

The safety's off and I put on her

Ohh stick em up, stick em up

Ready to shoot"
