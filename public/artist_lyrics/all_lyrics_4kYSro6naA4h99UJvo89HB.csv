Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get in Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in them shoes

I was covered in dollars, now I'm dripping in jewels

A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food

Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool

Went from making tuna sandwiches to making the news

I started speaking my mind and tripled my views

Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs

Get money, go hard, you're motherfucking right

Never been no fraud in my motherfucking life

Get money, go hard, damn fucking right

Stunt on these bitches out of motherfucking spite

Ain't no running up on me, went from nothing to glory

I ain't telling ya to do it, I'm just telling my story

I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny

And I got enough bras, ya ain't gotta support me

I went from rag to riches, went from way too lit, nigga

Only person in my fam to see six figures

The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders

When you gotta make sure that everybody straight

Bitches stab you in your back while they smiling in your face

Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case

I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas

Climb to the top floor so I can spit on niggas

Said ""I was just trying to chill and make bangers""

Tell all these old bitches they in danger

The thing on my hip whip bitches in to shape

That's what I call a fucking waist trainer

You gon' run up on who and do what?

I think ya got your story screwed up

I came here to ball, is you nuts?

I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough

I'm the one that's killing shit, hands down

If you got a problem with me, say it now

'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissing

'Specially not from one you weak bitches

I'm on the go like I don't see no stop lights

I'm stepping out every day, prom night

So if it's all love, show me love then

'Cause you hating on a bitch, that's what it sounds like

Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga

Hoodie low, that's how I'm pulling up

Just 'cause I been on the road, don't mean I been on the run

And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun

And we all know you ain't that tight

I smack you and the bitch that you act like

I started getting money, bitches upset

They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight

Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced

Come through shinning with them Rollies bust face

Headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case

Ain't no bitches spittin' like this since 08'

I don't trust no nigga, I don't feel no bitch

Whole life been through some fucked up shit

They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this

When you seen what I've seen, you end up like this

I walked into the label, ""where the check at?""

Cardi B on the charts, you can expect that

Where that bitch that was claiming she a threat?

I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at

They say, I'm too ratchet

They say, I act wild

I'm Chyna wit' the porn

Like a bad ass child

They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now

Cardi B, know it's me

Hear that ""blap"" sound (Blap!)



Man, I said we gon' win

Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten

Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win

Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten

Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win

Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten

Yeah, but I get up ten

Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten

Bitch



I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me

Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy

I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me

We gon' win

Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten

Yeah

Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten

You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee

Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me

Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?

I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me

I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent

And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front

I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me

You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga

Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head

You want some random bitch up in your bed?

She don't even know your middle name, watch her cause she might steal your chain

You don't want someone who loves you instead? 

I guess not though

It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met

Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget

You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different

Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent

Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt

It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse

It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up

Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck

Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt

Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self

You make me sick, nigga

Mis tenis Balenciaga, me reciben en la entrada

Pa-pa-pa-pa-razzi, like I'm Lady Gaga

Y no te me hagas, que en cover de Billboard tú has visto mi cara

No salgo de tu mente

Donde quieras que viajes has escuchado ""Mi Gente""

Yo no soy high, soy como el Testarossa (Testarossa)

Yo soy el que se la vive y también el que la goza (goza, goza)

En la cosa, mami en la cosa (cosa, cosa)

Call your mama phone, let her know that she raised a bitch
Then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around acting like they my bros

I seen y'all little group texts

Where you all like to brag about your hoes

And you can tell your little bitch

I screenshotted all her naked pics

Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?

Wake up and see your boobs on the 'gram?

Little bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus

I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers

Smash your TV from Best Buy

You gon' turn me into into Left Eye

I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy

I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me

I'm holding back everything that's inside of me

How you all fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

You sleeping like a baby

Everyone was right about you now, and

(You creeping, you creeping, you creeping)



I went through your phone last night

I went through your phone last night

Saw some things I didn't like

I went through your phone last night

It's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh



All I can see is you and her in different scenarios

Beyoncé on my stereo, resentment on repeat

I'mma make a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach

Serve it to you like, ""Here you go, nigga, bon appétit""

Look did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?

You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?

You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches

You don't even cheat with no bad bitches

This shit is eating me, you sleeping peacefully

Getting more mad at you, thinking 'bout stabbing you

Don't even know that you this close to dying

You gon' wake up like, ""Why you got an attitude?""

I think you broke hoes need to get a job (get a job)

I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it

Gucci shoes and a belt like it

Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance

I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it

I'm in a boss bitch mood, ay

These heels are Givenchy, ho, these are some boss bitch shoes

If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ay

For the record, I set records, record sales

I like niggas that been in and out of jail

I'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed

Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest

The coupe is ruthless, but I get top in it

I'm provocative, it's my prerogative

80K just to know what time is it

Cardi rocking it, go buy stock in it

Spent what I want, ain't no limit

I say what I want, I ain't never been timid

Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it

Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue

Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through

Here's a word to my ladies

Don't you give these niggas none (give 'em none)

If they can make you richer, they can make you cum

Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?

How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore you get the cost?

Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?

All these labels, throwing deals from left to right

But I ain't giving in until they get them numbers right

All these people think that this shit happen overnight

All that flexin' they be doing

Shit is all a hype

No tolerance for a hating bitch

Talking shit

Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm sucking dick

So when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fucking lit

And don't be talking all that sorry shit

Don't flip the script

I see the lights

I hear the hype

I hit the mic

I'm running down

It's on sight

I throw my hands

I hit em' left

But it's all good cause now they wanna get up in my VIP

Blowing up my phone

Saying everything I touch is lit

Acting cool and wanna fuck me

Like they wasn't talking shit

I let em' live

Let the shady motherfuckers live

Get them the price then it's time to show em' what it is

Don't got the bat?

Well then what you really tryna pitch?

Don't waste my time

I ain't never been no average bitch



Not to mention

I did my tour and that shit was winning

Independent, the headline

Award of feeling

I thank the Lord for all the blessings that he is given

I love the fans

They fill me up with their ammunition

I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this

I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office

Corny bitches tryna keep up?

Look exhausted

Wave the white flag

Girl, you might as well just forfeit



My ex told me I was never gon' be shit

Lookie, lookie now

Lookie now

Nigga I'm that bitch

What you thought?

Yeah, you really lost

Now you kinda sick

But I ain't never need a nigga

I was always on my shit

I used to stare at magazines

On the train

Looking at these models

Like ""I gotta be this one day""

Fuck around

I know it feels good, but this shit just got to end

I'm counting on you boo

Put this peer pressure on you

If I overcame that shit

I know you can make it too

I don't want to see you lose

There's other ways to heal that bruise

I know you can make it to see what's at the end of the solution

And your bitch could get it too double date boo

So let's get it so let's get it so let's get it let's not waste a minute

You clearly started so let's finish

I don't do forgiveness, they take your kindness for a gimmick

I'm just here for business

I'm running down and I'm with it



Ran down on that bitch twice

Ran down on that bitch twice

You know me I be with whatever

If a bitch beef with me we gon' beef foreva

Ran down on that bitch twice

Ran down on that bitch twice

You know me I be with whatever

If a bitch beef with me we gon' beef foreva"
