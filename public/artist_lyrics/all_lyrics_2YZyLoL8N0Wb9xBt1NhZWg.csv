La noche de anoche
Y nos ponemos a llorar
Yesterday, somebody whacked out my mural
That energy'll make you niggas move to Europe

But it's regular for me, yeah, that's for sure

The love and hate is definite without a cure

All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord

I'll kill 'em all before I let 'em kill my joy

I done been through it all, what you endure?

It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it's plural

Fuck everybody, that's on my body

My blick first, then God got me

I watch 'em pandеr with them back-handed compliments

Put thеy head on a Cuban link as a monument

I paid homage and I always mind my business

I made the—

I never lost who I am for a rap image

It's motivation if you wonder how I did it



Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank

Know you a god even when they say you ain't

Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way

Never let no one put smut up on your name

Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do

But understand everybody ain't gon' like you

Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to

A couple rules of engagements, I'ma guide you



Que refleja en tu mirada

La noche, tú y yo



Ridin' in my GNX with Anita Baker in the tape deck, it's gon' be a sweet love

Fuck apologies, I wanna see y'all geeked up

Don't acknowledge me, then maybe we can say it's fair

Take it to the internet and I'ma take it there

Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn't make it

Now I'm possessed by a spirit and they can't take it

Used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud

Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down

Whatever, though, call me crazy, everybody questionable

Turn me to an eskimo, I drew the line and decimals

Snoop posted ""Taylor Made,"" I prayed it was the edibles

I couldn't believe it, it was only right for me to let it go

Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me

All these niggas agitated, I'm just glad they showin' they faces

Quite frankly, plenty artists, but they outdated

Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you they favorite

This is not for lyricists, I swear it's not the sentiments

Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit

Old soul, bitch, I probably built them pyramids

Ducking strays when I rap battled in the Nickersons

Where you from? Not where I'm from, we all indigenous

Against all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends

Against all odds, I showed up as a gentleman

I done lost plenty friends, sixteen to be specific

Put that on my kids' children, we gon' see the future first

They like, ""Dot big trippin,"" I just want what I deserve

What bridge they done burnt? All of them, it's over with

I'm doin' what COVID did, they'll never get over it



Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank

Know you a god even when they say you ain't

Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way

Never let no one put smut up on your name

Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do

But understand everybody ain't gon' like you

Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to

A couple rules of engagements, here to guide you



Niggas from my city couldn't entertain old boy

Promisin' bank transactions and even bitcoin

I never peaced it up, that shit don't sit well with me

Before I take a truce, I'll take 'em to Hell with me

If that money got in the hands of a crash dummy

Could jeopardize my family and burden the ones who love me

Niggas mad 'cause I decided not to pretend

Y'all stay politically correct, I'ma do what I did

Ain't no sympathy here, this shit's hilarious

It's a lot of opinions, but no power to carry it

2025, they still movin' on some scary shit

Tell 'em quit they job and pay the real niggas they severance

Don't insult my intelligence, I'm not just for the television

Teleport to Bullets Road and dig up all my relatives

Okay, nigga, let's settle it, these niggas been fake loyal

Since y'all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you

Okay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die

Niggas cackling about— while all of y'all is on trial

Niggas thought that I was antisocial when I stayed inside of my house

You better off to have one woman, everything tricky right now

You niggas live in denial

Ayy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow

A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with 'em in style

Exterminate 'em right now

Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud

No juice iniside of my cup, I sober up and knock 'em all off

Don't let no white comedian talk about no Black woman, that's law

I know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that's close to them

The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein' groomed, slide on both of them

You ever ate Cap'n Crunch and proceeded to pour water in it?

Pulled over by the law, you ridin' dirty, so you can't argue with 'em?

Then make it to be a star, bare your soul and put your heart up in it?

Well, I did

Whacked the murals out, but it ain't no legends if my legend ends"

'Cause my intentions was pure

Even when you wasn't sure

Even with every allure

How much temptation you endured?

You'd probably look for every cure

I said I deserve it all

I'm wakin' up at 6 a.m.

Six miles a day, conditionin' my wind

I said I deserve it all

I'm showin' up as your friend

Tellin' truths better than your next of kin

Seekin' validation just for the aesthetics, bitch

Yeah, he deserves it all

A close relationship with God

Whisper to me every time I close my eyes

He say, ""You deserve it all""

Keep these bitch niggas away from me

Keep all my blessings faithfully

Keep my essence contagious, that's okay with me

I burn this bitch down, don't you play with me or stay with me

I'm crashin' out right now, no one's safe with me

I did it with integrity and niggas still try hate on me, just wait and see

More blood be spillin', it's just paint to me

Dangerously, nothin' changed with me, still got pain in me

Flip a coin, want the shameless me or the famous me?

How annoying, does it angers me to know the lames can speak

On the origins of the game I breathe? That's insane to me

It's important, I deserve it all because it's mine

Tell me why you think you deserve the greatest of all time, motherfucker

La noche, tú y yo
I got this fire burnin' in me from within
Concentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin
Every day, a new version of me, a third of me demented, cemented in pain

Juggling opposing kinds of fame

I don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul

I recollect this isolation, I was four years old

Truth be told, I've been battling my soul

Tryna navigate the real and fake

Cynical about the judgement day

I did bad, slight progression last year and it fucked me up

Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus

Body after body, lesson after lesson, let's take it back to Michigan in 1947

My father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him

I didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing

Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on the grand level

The most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel

And so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world

With my guitar up on my hip, that's the story unfurled

I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect

While the record business loved me

I was head of rhythm and blues

The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose

But I manipulated power as I lied to the masses

Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated



Another life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin' Circuit

Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains

My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed

A musical genius what the articles emphasized

Had everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction

Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted

Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be

Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity

Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments

I needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin

Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar

Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'

My first assistant was a small town scholar

Never did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her

My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me

I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated



My present life is Kendrick Lamar

A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe

The only factor I respected was raisin' the bar

My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh

My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him

I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'

Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment

I close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious

I'm yelling, ""Father, did I finally get it right?"" Everything I did was selfless

I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them

I didn't gloat, even told 'em, ""No,"" when the vultures came

Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed

Son, you do well, but your heart is closed

I can tell residue that linger from your past creates a cell

Father, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down

But your pride has to die,"" okay, Father, show me how

Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for

I kept one hundred institutions paid

Okay, tell me more

I put one hundred hoods on one stage

Okay, tell me more

I'm tryna push peace in L.A. 

But you love war

No, I don't

Oh, yes, you do

Okay, then tell me the truth

Every individual is only a version of you

How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?

I could tell you where I'm going

I could tell you who you are

You fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious

Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous

Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent

My greatest music director was you

It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues

It was harmony and motion

I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken

Rehabilitation, not psychosis

But now we here now

Centuries you manipulated man with music

Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving

You came a long way from garnishing evilish views

And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval

I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear

The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real

The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel

I'm using words for inspiration as an idea

So can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?

I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding

For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?

I vow my life just to live one in harmony now

You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity

And I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy

Then let's rejoice where we at

I rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated"

Have you ever took a fade and ran three more back to back?

Oh, you haven't? Then shut the fuck up and keep it rap

Gah, gah, gah

Bitch, I’m from the LAnd

Don't say you hate L.A. when you don't travel past the 10

Am I trippin'? Yes, I am

Meditate over some money, I see Franklin, I find zen

Bitch, I'm from the LAnd

Don't say you hate L.A., but live in L.A. and pretend

My neck on Tarantino, Alejandro, Spike Lee

Just know you took the scenic route if you stand by me, stupid



So fly in this bitch

Fifty on me, don't die tryin' and shit (Ooh-ooh)

You know I’m up and down when I slide in this bitch

Dreamers and the Jets outside in this bitch

Westside, get the money, yeah, that’s fo' sho’

Streets don't love you, better respect the code

Ain't no sleepin' in on Sunday

If it’s 'bout the money, then my niggas on go



When I walk in, oh yeah, bring that

It's unanimous, how I pop shit

When I walk in, hoes better get in check

You lookin' at a bad bitch, nothin' less

Walk, walk, walk, walk

Walk, walk, walk, walk

Tip, toe, pivot, walk

Tip, toe, pivot, walk



Ooh, don't take it personal

You won't be the first to know

Just might be the first to go

Just might be, ooh

Just might be the first to go

Studio filled with Jack In The Box and Pepsis
Niggas watchin' Worldstar videos, not the ESPYs
Laughin' at B Pump, her stomach turnin', I get up and proceeded to write somethin'
Ab-Soul in the corner mumblin' raps, fumblin' packs of Black & Milds
Crumblin' kush 'til he cracked a smile

His words legendary, wishin' I could rhyme like him

Studied his style to define my pen

That was back when the only goal was to get Jay Rock through the door

Warner Brother Records, hope Naim Ali would let us know

Was excited just to go to them label meetings

Wasn't my record deal, but still, I couldn't beliеve it

Me and Rock inside thе booth hibernatin'

It was simple math, if he made it, that mean I made it

Everything I had was for the team, I remained patient

Grindin' with my brothers, it was us against them, no one above us, bless our hearts



Use your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax and ride)

If you got time and I got time (Yeah, yeah)

Free your thoughts and watch them fly

Use your heart and not your eyes (Mm-hmm)



My nigga Dave had a champagne Acura

A bunch of instrumentals I freestyled in the passenger

That nigga wore several hats, a producer, a manager, director, and DJ

A hothead squabblin', Bloods, Pirus, and Keeways

For this little thing of ours we called TDE

I watch you take some penitentiary chances to say the least

Remember in the county building with MixedByAli

We tried to freak the system just to make a couple ends meet

That's my nigga for shit sure

He brought Q over, but Q didn't rap, but he learned from our inspo

We split Louisiana chicken riverboat special

Sleepin' next to 02R consoles to be our refuge

He was homeless and I left home

Q said, ""Dot, you won't be slept on, you the nigga to bet on"" (Use your h—)

Top had given us the million in the home lived in

Hopin' that we see some millions, God bless our hearts



Use your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax and ride)

If you got time and I got time (Yeah, yeah)

Free your thoughts and watch them fly

Use your heart and not your eyes



Punch played Phil Jackson in my early practices

Strategies on how to be great amongst the averages

I picked his brain on what was ordained, highly collaborative

Rep pushed the label the same, amongst the savages

Moose kept my name in the function that he would run in

TEEZ kept the vultures away from me that was comin'

Sounwave let me borrow his clothes for shows as a hype man

To cook up in this room 'til the night ends

Time flies, I'm carryin' debates of a top five

Buryin' my opps and allies

But I'd done a half job communicatin' feelings of being stagnant

Life was gettin' bigger than just rappin'

The business, what I was lackin'

Top used to record me back when it was poor me

And now we at the round table for what assures me

I guess my motivation was the yearnin' for independence

Poured everything I had left in the family business

Now it's about Kendrick, I wanna evolve, place my skillset as a Black exec'

I jog my memory, knowin' Black Hippy didn't work 'cause of me

Creatively, I moved on with new concepts in reach

Top, remember all them sessions we would strategize

To hit the streets, then come back, record three records? Ah

To tell the truth, it fucked me up when D-Man passed

The motive was the condolences, but the pride crashed

I had to bypass old mythologies I had

Put my heart on display like it was an iMac

To all my young niggas, let me be the demonstration

How to conduct differences with a healthy conversation

If that's your family, then handle it as such

Don't let the socials gas you up or let emotions be your crutch

Pick up the phone and bust it up before the history is lost

Hand-to-handshake is good when you have a heart-to-heart



Use your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax your mind)

If you got time and I got time (Yeah, yeah)

Free your thoughts and watch them fly

Hop out suicide doors, it's the Hitta, man

You don't wanna see them doors slidin' on the Caravan

I know killers who was catchin' bodies and not one fade

I was thirteen up at Avalon, poppin' chains

Fourteen, ridin' minibikes with some dead friends

Twenty-one, flag on my head like a Taliban

Twenty-five, feelin' like the box, it was full of sand

At the cemetery, fuck that, that's where I could've been

142nd, I'm connected like I'm Rosecrans

Me and my bitch got a complicated relationship
She's so controllin', I noticed it ain't no playin' with
I met her when I was off the porch as a teenager
She said one day I would right my wrongs and see paper

We started out young, lookin' for some identity, made a thousand mistakes

But never did we lack chemistry

Wrappin' my hand 'round your waist

That was back when you did whatever I say

Dreams of sellin' narcotics, runnin' blocks, or robbin' banks

I was in love with you, didn't know what it was with you

Kiss you in back of the class just to get a buzz with you

Some niggas wanted you, but they weren't committed

Preoccupied playin' John Madden and bullshittin'

Remember when granny died? You looked at me and said, ""Baby, dry your eyes

Depend on me as your relief, let your anger be mine""

We was locked in ever since then

So territorial, even took me 'way from my friends, hmm, hmm (Gah, gah, gah)



Scared of forever, you know nothin' else is gon' pass

I just gotta let you know, woah

Whenever you want me, you got me 'til the end of time

Ooh, just gotta let you know



Said you gon' see other people if I didn't grow with you

Wasn't no more holdin' them pistols in front of stores with you

You want reality, not tragedy, for sure, I get you

To tell the truth, I been pretty used to what open-minded people do

In 2014, I went to Africa, baby, you was my passenger

My eyes and ears for all the years the neighborhood had baffled us

Of course I had to wrap it up, I didn't fully trust you

Fabrication, I disgust you, then you blocked me, I said, ""Fuck you""



Nigga, what?

I gave you life, I breathe the motherfuckin' charisma in this bitch

I bring the blessings, I gave you power

Nigga, I bring the rainfall, I gave you hustle

Then fall right back in love the very moment that I touch you (Gah, gah, gah)



Scared of forever, you know nothin' else is gon' pass

I just gotta let you know

Whenever you want me, you got me 'til the end of time

Ooh, just gotta let you know



You were spontaneous, firecracker, plus our love is dangerous

Life of passion, laughin' at you lose your temper, slightly crashin'

Dumb enough to ill reaction, ain't no disrespect

Highly sensitive, possess, saw potential, even when it's tragic

So jealous, hate it when I hit the club to get some bitches

Wrote 'em off, rather see me hit the church and get religious

Who you foolin'? I know what you doin', you my contradiction

'Member when you caught that body and still wiggled through that sentence?

Loved you more, when you flip and lose your shit, I hugged you more

It's sexy to me, cuss they ass out and hold that grudge some more

Down bitch, I know your favorite movie, is it Notebook?

So good, if they all sub me, get 'em all booked

My baby boo, you either heal niggas or you kill niggas

Both is true, it take some tough skin just to deal with you

Logical explanation don't exist, flippin' pages

Chapter after chapter, probably remarry and head to Vegas

Bitches gettin' marked out, they can't erase our history

They margins ain't big enough, they all led by bigotry

My woman and my right hand, my saint and my sin

Ain't no bitch like my bitch 'cause that bitch been my pen



Gloria, I wanna take you to euphoria

Bitches want, but they ain't strong enough

I heard they talking, we notorious

If someone talking on me

I see you, you see me

Both see what we want, oh, oh

I see you, you see me

Both see what we want"

What is a relative making repetitive narratives

That is a snitch on a pedestal

What is a house with a better view?

A way that I show my maturity

What if I call on security?

That mean I'm calling on God for purity

I went and got me a therapist

I can debate on my theories and sharing it (Woah)

Consolidate all my comparisons

Humble enough because time is imperative (Woah)

Started to feel like there's only one answer

To everything, I don't know where it is (Woah)

Popping a bottle of Claritin (Woah)

Is it my head or my arrogance? (Woah)

Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?

I'm flipping my time through the Rolodex

Indulging myself and my life and my music

The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac

The world that we in is just menacing

I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax

Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice

Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic

Never had it in public, late reaction

Fifty K to cousins, post a caption

Pray none of my enemies hold me captive



I grieve different

I grieve different (Huh)



I met her on the third night of Chicago

North America tour, my enclave

Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model

Dedicated to the songs I wrote in her Bible

Eyes like green penetratin' the moonlight

Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like

Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me

Phone out to ring, but tell the world I'm busy

Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn't care enough

Sympathize when her daddy in a chain gang

Her first brother got killed, he was 21

I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave

Heart broken when Estelle didn't say goodbye

Chad left his body after we FaceTimed

Green eyes said you'd be okay, first to assess the pain away

We's them killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch

Germaphobic, heteron



I am not for the faint of heart

My genetic build can build multi universes, the men of God

Playin' ""Baby Shark"" with my daughter

Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time

Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her

My son Enoch, it's the part two

When I inspire my children and make higher values

In my present moment I saw that through

Ask Whitney about my lust addiction

Text messagin' bitches got my thumbs hurt

Set precedent for a new sacreligion

Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me

Asked God to speak through me, that's what you're hearing now

The voice of yours truly

Teleport out my home body for comfort

I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question

Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to

No, I don't blink like I used to

Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man

But still this man compared to nobody

Yesterday I prayed to the flowers and trees

Gratification to the powers that be

Synchronization with my energy shackles that goes to doctor Zebi

Paid it for, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy

Sciatical nerve pinch, I don't know how to feel

Like the first time I fucked a white bitch



The first time I fucked a white bitch, I was sixteen at the Palisades, fumblin' my grades

I traveled with a team, the apache life, Sintennio was like

When Mrs. Becker screamed, ""That dough, boy, mixed there with purple rain""

They interchanged the seams

Happy just to be out the hood, with all the wealthy years

Credit cards and family plans, she drove her daddy's Benz

I found out he was a sheriff, that was a win-win

Because he had locked up Uncle Perry

She paid her daddy's sins

Next time I fucked a white bitch, was out in Copenhagen

Good Kid, M.A.A.D City tour, I flourished on them stages

Whitney asked did I have a problem

I said, ""I might be racist""

Ancestors watchin' me fuck was like retaliation



I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch

We's them killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch

Germaphobic, heteron, homophobic

Photoshoppin' lies and motives

Hide your eyes and pose for the pic'

I'd be the first to say to each exec', ""I'm saving your children"" (What the fuck?)

We can't negotiate (What the-)

I caught a couple of bodies myself, slipped my community

My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out euologies

Not because the rags in the park had red gradient

But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin'

So what's the difference between your life? We're hiding motives

The fatalities and reality bring you closure

The noble person that goes to work and pray like they 'posed to?

Slaughter people too, your murder's just a bit slower



I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch (What the fuck?)

We's them killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch (What the-)

Germaphobic, heteron, homophobic

Photoshoppin' lies and motives

Yeah, well, you need to talk to someone
You talk to everyone



I come from a generation of home invasions

And I got daddy issues, that's on me

Everything them four words done taught me

Made Heaven's bury deep

That man knew a lot

But not enough to keep me past them streets

My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see

Daddy issues run across my head, told me, ""Fuck a foul""

I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud

A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house

I stand outside, laughin' was my friends, they don't know my life

Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well

Momma said that boy is exhausted, he said, ""Go fuck yourself""

If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch

You could be a bitch or step out the margin, I got up quick

I'm chargin' baskets and fallen' backwards, tryna keep balance

Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent

Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice

Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues



Early mornin' wake ups (Ah) practicin' on day-ups (Ah)

Tough love (Ah), but hold up, no chaser (Ah)

Need no chaser (Ah), need no chaser (Ah)

Need no chaser (Ah), need no chase

Early mornin' wake ups (Ah), practicin' on day-ups (Ah, day ups)

Tough love (Ah), but hold up, no chaser (Ah)

Need no chaser (Ah), need no chaser (Ah)

Need no chaser (Ah), need no chaser



I got daddy issues, that's on me

Lookin' for, ""I love you,"" rarely emphasizin' for my relief

A child that grew accustomed, jumping' up when I scraped my knee

'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me to not be weak

Daddy issues, hear my emotions, never express myself

Man should never show feelings, bein' sensitive never helped

His momma died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon

His first reply was on this life, the pills got no silver spoon

Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son

Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'nem

This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none

So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love

Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga

I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga

When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused

Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do

Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (Ah)

Need assistance with the way I was brought up (Ah, ah)

What's the difference when your heart is made of stone

And your mind is made of gold and your tongue has made its word

But it may weaken your soul

My niggas ain't got no daddy, grew up overcompensatin'

Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' a gangsta

I love my father for tellin' me take off the gloves

'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was

And to my partners that figured it out without a father

I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddles

It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes

'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues



Early mornin' wake ups (Ah), practicin' on day-ups (Ah, day ups)

Tough love (Ah), but hold up, no chaser (Ah)

Need no chaser (Ah), need no chaser (Ah)

Need no chaser (Ah), need no chaser"

That's what I call love
The closest ones afraid to say they need some time
The turn around is life or death, but you don't mind

Go out the way to say you made the compromise

That's what I call love

But the time it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you

You say no and all you've done gives them amnesia

One thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons



And I can't please everybody

No, I can't please everybody

Wait, you can't please everybody

No, I can't please everybody

I can't please everybody



They idolize and praise your name across the nation

Tap the feed and nod the head for confirmation

Promise that you keep the music in rotation

That's what I call love (That's what I call love)

But the time it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you

(But the time it'll come) (When somebody needs you)

You say no and all you've done gives them amnesia (They don't remember)

One thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons



And I can't please everybody

No, I can't please everybody

Wait, you can't please everybody

No, I can't please everybody

And I can't please everybody

No, I can't please everybody

Wait, you can't please everybody

Heart plays in waves, the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in waves, the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in waves, the mind can't figure out
This is how we conceptualize human beings

My auntie is a man now

I think I'm old enough to understand now

Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards

Motorola pager off like, ""Yes, Jackie""

Blue Air Max's, gold chains and curl kits

'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest

Big social, big personality, vocal

Played underground verbatim and stayed local

My auntie is a man now

I watch him and his girl hold their hands down

Tip of the avenues street lights made his

Thinking, ""I want me a bad bitch when I get big""

They walk the corner like California king

Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road

See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado

Scratching the likes from lotto

Hoping that she pull up tomorrow

So I can hang out in the front seat

Six by nines keeping the music up under me

My auntie is a man now

Asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much

And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much

She said ""Ain't no telling

Niggas always been jealous because he had more women

More money and more attention made more envy

Calling him anything but than broke was less offending""



My auntie is a man now

I think I'm old enough to understand now

Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards

Back when it was comedic relief to say ""Faggot""

Faggot, faggot faggot, we ain't know no better

Elementary kids with no filter however

My auntie became a man and I took pride in it

She wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference

That's what I told my friends in second grade

She picking up from school, they stare at her in the face

They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed

We pull off bumpin' quick like it was nothing

My auntie is a man now, what a relationship

I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit

He gave me some cash then gave me some gang

Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained

She even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade

The first person I seen write a rap

That's when my life had changed

House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window

Cameras on the microphone, all women and men though

My auntie was a man now, we cool with it

The history had trickled down and made us ig'nant

My favorite cousin said he's returning the favor

And following my auntie with the same behavior



Demetrius is Mary-Ann now

He's more confident to live his plan now

But the family in disbelief this time

Convincing themselves ""He ain't living discreet, he's fine""

They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it

The Barbie dolls played off the reflection of Venus

He built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over

He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking

""Faggot, faggot, faggot"" We ain't know no better

Middle school kids with no filter, however

I had to be very mindful of my good cousin

I knew exactly who he was but I still loved him



Demetrius is Mary-Ann now

I mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further

Changed his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain

Living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon

We didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant

Wasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive

But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor

Made raw, but time changes all



Demetrius is Mary-Ann now

Remember church, Easter Sunday?

I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith

More spiritual when these dudes were living life straight

Which I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same

He said my cousin was going through some things

He promised the world we living in was an act on abomination

And Demetrius was to blame

I knew you was conflicted by the feelings a preacher made

Wondering if God still call you a decent man

Still you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint

Until he singled you out to prove his point, saying



Demetrius is Mary-Ann now

Church, his auntie is a man now, it hurt

He the most 'cause his belief was close to his words

Forcing me to stand now

I said ""Mr. Preacher man, should we love thy neighbor?

The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?

I recognize the study she was taught since birth

But that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved""

The building was thinking out loud, bad angel

That's when you looked at me and smiled, said ""Thank you""

The day I chose humanity over religion

The family got closer, it was all forgiven

I said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better

Mistakenly I didn't think you'd know any different

See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound

If everything was pronounced without any intentions

If every second you challenge the shit I was kicking

Reminded me about a show I did out the city

That time I brung a fan on stage to rap

But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me

You said ""Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction

To truly understand love, switch position

'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together

But only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'"""

The day I was delivered they said I would build a legacy
Picture me with influence that last generations
I was made out of love to keep you happy and educated
The first three letters of the alphabet my name
I made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing

I been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac

So dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged

My father was a public figure, bigger than life

Lived as a winner, on stages alike

Rivers of people surely united, just to see our bond

Time carried on, that was a common thread

My perfect father had many flaws

Still they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison

He had more children, I was the oldest

We always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em

He told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings

Sexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school

The price of being iconic was demonic and screwed

I stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news

Stress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused

I knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't choose

See, it was more than humiliation and bein' sued

They crucified my affiliation for points to prove

And now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to you

My total existence was for makin' a smiling move

They said that I'll live forever

But the moment he died, more accusations arrived

I had to die too



I remember takin' my first breath August 28th, 1963

The whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV

My come out was a standing ova', the crowd in disbelief

How could a group of words be so great?

Designed to make you think

Races and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form

How gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm?

The person responsible, my creator

He never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation

Watch him perform with conviction

Two hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen

I gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission

His life became heroic, then tables turned

My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned

Other women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect

It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me

I prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy

How many lives'll fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy?

I won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job

I was only born to make sure your children can play outside

And I imagine the other demons he hid before he died

If they came to surface this dream probably won't be alive

Because of you



I was born in paranoia, it's poison for us

We can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck

The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up

The non-creators are now elated and out of touch

Why can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give?

Stop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived

You want the head of the messenger and the history from him

Which eventually takes away from the good you accustom

Think of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin'

The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in

The great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice

Why can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?

Because your better judgement will always look down on me

But if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me

I got a theory that most of y'all won't allow to see

It goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality

See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?

If Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?

I can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a God

Just know the Earth is just a rock without the voices of art

Sincerely yours"

One man standin' on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify broken, pieces of me, it was all a blur

Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties

I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five

I still feel weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision

In the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic

Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today

I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taken shape

My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife

Starin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night

Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover

Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober



I wish I was somebody

Anybody but myself

Ooh, I wish I was somebody

Anybody but myself



I remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted

Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas

Family ties, they accused my cousin

""Did he touch you Kendrick?""

Never lied, but no one believed me when I said ""He didn't""

Frozen moments, still holdin' on it

Hard to trust myself, I started rhymin'

Copin' mechanisms to lift up myself

Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself

He has an aurora, I hope to achieve

If I find some help, congratulations, made it to be famous

Still I feel uneasy, water watchin', live my life in nature

Only thing relieves me

Spirit guide whisper in my ear tell me that she sees me

""Did he touch you?"" I said ""No"" again, still they didn't believe me

Mothers brother said he got revenge for my mothers face

Black and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase

'Til this day can't look her in the eyes pain is takin' over

Blame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober



I wish I was somebody

Anybody but myself

Ooh, I wish I was somebody

Anybody but myself



I was never high, I was never drunk

Never out my mind, I need control

They handed me some smoke, but still I declined

I did it sober sittin' with myself

I went through all emotions, no dependents

Except for the one, let me bring you closer, intoxicated

There's a lustful nature that I failed to mention

Insecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women

Whitney's hurt, the pure soul I know, I found her in the kitchen

Askin' God ""Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?""

Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes

""Is there an addiction?"" I said ""No"", but this time I lied

I knew that I can't fix it, pure soul, even in her pain

Know she cared for me, gave me a number

Said she recommended some therapy

I asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her ""No""

I never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic

Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection

Though it never happened, she wouldn't agree

Now I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced

Amplified as I write this song, I shiver 'cause I'm nervous

I was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years

Nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel

I made it home, seven years on tour, chasin' manhood

But Whitney's gone by time you hear this song, she did all she could

All these women gave me super powers, what I thought I lacked

I pray our children don't inherit me and my feelings

I attract a conversation, not bein' addressed in black families

The devastation hauntin' generations and humanity

They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters

Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other

Psychotic torture between our lives we ain't recovered

Still livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance

Every other brother has been compromised

I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused

I see 'em daily burin' the pain in chains and tattoos

So listen close before you start to pass judgement on how we move

Learn how we cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school

His ankle grows deep in misogyny

This is posttraumatic black families and a sodomy, today is still active

So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made

So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame

So I set free my cousin, khaotic for my mothers pain

I hope Hykeem made you proud, 'cause you ain't die in vein

So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all

So I set free out children, may good karma keep them with God

So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred

As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation



I wish I was somebody

Anybody but myself

Ooh, I wish I was somebody

Anybody but myself



You did it, I'm proud of you

You broke a generational curse

Say ""Thank you dad""

Thank you daddy, thank you mommy, thank you brother

Don't you point a finger, just to point a finger

'Cause critical thinkin' is a deal-breaker

Faith in one man is a ship sinking

Do yourself a favor and get a mirror

The mirror grieving

Then point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom

She told me she need me the most, I didn't believe her

She even called me names on the post, the world can see it

Jokes and gaslightin'

Mad at me 'cause she didn't get my vote, she say I'm triffiln'

Disregardin' the way that I cope with my own vices

Maybe, it's time to break it off

Runaway from the culture to follow my heart



I realized, true love's not savin' face, but, unconditional

When will you let me go?

I trust your fine independence

If not, then all is forgiven

Sorry our things saved the world my friend

I was too busy buildin' my redempt'



I choose me, I'm sorry

I choose me, I'm sorry

I choose me, I'm sorry

I choose me, I'm sorry

I choose me, I'm sorry

I choose me, I'm sorry

I choose me, I'm sorry

I choose me, I'm sorry

I choose me, I'm sorry

And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people

I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor

Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer

Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence

Make the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment

Residue burned, mist of the inner-city

Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy

No protection is risky

Desensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged

Get used to hearin' arsenal rain

Analyze, risk your life, take the charge

Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard, that's culture

Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called

Said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved

I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house

Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed

Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed

A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams, the culture



(I want, I want, I want, I want)

But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)

I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)

I want the hood

Look what I done for you (Look what I done for you)

Look what I done for you



I said I do this for my culture

To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover

In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper

Hair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'

Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets

No option if you froze up, always play the offense

Niggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work

Workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork

That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya

Remote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya

The streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me

I wanna represent for us

New revolution was up and movin'

I'm in Argentina wiping my tears full of confusion

Water in between us, another peer's been executed

History repeats again

Make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it

But that's the culture, crack a bottle

Hard to deal with the pain when you're sober

By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over

That's the problem

Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows

Dehumanized, insensitive

Scrutinize the way we live for you and I

Enemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you

In the land where no equal is your equal

Never say I ain't told ya, nah

In the land where hurt people hurt more people

Fuck callin' it culture



(I want, I want, I want, I want)

But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)

I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)

I want the hood

Look what I done for you (Look what I done for you)

Look what I done for you



Take the drums out

(Heavy breathing)



Celebrate new life when it come back around

The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now

Sacrifice personal gain over everything

Just to see the next generation better than ours

I wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered

Temptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures

I felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry

But all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urging

Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here

Where the energy is magnified and persevered

Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear

Euphoria is glorified and made His

Reflectin' on my life and what I done

Paid dues, made rules, change outta love

Them same views made schools change curriculums

But didn't change me starin' down the barrel of that gun

Should I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?

Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?

Everything is everything, this ain't coincidental

I woke up that morning with more heart to give you

As I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence

To my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven

To my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven

To my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven

To my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings

To my fans, make sure you make them investments

And to the killer that sped up my demise

I forgive you, just know your soul's in question

I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed

And though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved

I completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave

But fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased

I can't stress how I love y'all

I don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all

The memories recollect just because y'all

Celebrate me with respect

The unity we protect is above all

And Sam, I'll be watchin' over you

Make sure my kids watch all my interviews

Make sure you live all the dreams we produced

Keep that genius in your brain on the move

And to my neighborhood, let the good prevail

Make sure them babies and them leaders outta jail

Look for salvation when troubles get real

'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself

And I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed

Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel

And though my physical won't reap the benefits

The energy that carry on emits still

I want you"

King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'

King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed

King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect

King of the opps that miss it and dreamers that go and get it

King of the winners, district and geniuses with conviction

King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated

King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken

King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse

King of my enemies, may they father feed, I rejoice

King of the skyscrapers, dodging haters, broke religion

Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision

I embrace them with collision

Kings did it, king vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick

All hail the king, I dropped a million tears

I know several responsibilities put me here

I don't pedal backwards but I live old-fashioned

And the lens that I'm looking through

Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free

Ashes I'm dumping out, 'bout to spread 'cross all seas

Sisters and brother in unison, not because of me

Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace

And I'm still gon' fuck up your organization if any beef

What do you stand for?

Are you an activist? What are your city plans for?

Are you an accident, are you just in the way?

Your native tongue contradicting what your body language say

Are you a king or you joking, are you a king or you posing?

Are you a king or you smoking bud rocks to keep you open?

Because the king don't cry, king don't die

King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall

Kingdom come, when I come, you know why

King, king, king, king

I am T'Challa!"

Look inside the brain, it's a ride in the psych ward

Spit slick, attack is subliminal

Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister

Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal

Switch it like time signatures

Sorry momma, two bales, took a bad route

I done got my bands up, a nigga stacked now

But we been still O.T. on that bullshit (on that bullshit)

I don't wanna have to do it, empty full clips (empty full clips)

Why these niggas talkin' robbin', they don't do shit

High Cali niggas tapped in, we'll cook shit

Bust down on my neck, niggas reach gettin' stretched

Rockin' with this TEC, niggas better wear a vest

Last year I was broke, young nigga in the Crest

Now I show up 20 better, broke niggas keep the rest

I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would

I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

(DaBoii)

California nigga and I'm heavy in these streets

If you don't keep a pole, how you ready when there's beef? (If you don't keep a pole)

Lil' nigga think he cut, yeah I bet the nigga freeze

If that nigga want me dead, I can't let that nigga breathe

Want me gone, send a shot, like the real kind

These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind

Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time

They got a nigga at the edge but I feel fine

But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it

If your man's tour last year, yeah I play wit' 'em

One whole wood to the next, it's an eighth in it

New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga

A lot of shit on my mind, make me think a lot

Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cus I seen a lot

You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot

If we ain't on the same page you can kick her out, bitch!

And I been really tryna keep the peace

But I'm a north Vallejo nigga and I'm heavy in the streets

I was raised by my grannie and the gangsters

So at 8 I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and

I don't really like to talk

I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga

Now I ride around in foreign cars

And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga

I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names

She want a dog I'm a great dane

I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain

My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain

They ain't wanna see me win 'cus I'm black

So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back

If you need someone to call I'm the man for the task

You ain't standing for the 'cause meet the man in the mask"

Sweating in chess games try move like kings move

You should slow your roll before you drown in the moat

He tried to channel balance but never found the remote

Killers on the prowl still juggin' off a lick

Stealing, with a double for his *bleep*

It's warfare, is war fair? (No)

Just keep a dock on standby, charter a boat

Ship set sailing, planes depart

Are you playing your role?

I had to be about 9 when I first had seen it

Low lows pulled up outside of the Ralph's

After a car show at Dominguez

They had a disagreement, they had to air out

Just another day in Del Amo

Fo' sho man down, mando

Thank God I never had to knock your partner off

Or be an another casualty of war, Amen

There's 4 footprints in the sand where I walk

I never claimed to be a saint at all

Four Russians trippin' with hollow tips

And a Kalashnikov, ain't that y'all

No, Soulo hoe, kept it clean

Riding dirty, jury would have gave me thirty

Herbie love buggin' out, hit the target blindfolded

Electorial college devoted

To hit the score, to write the score, that's not a metaphor

Raging against the machinery, taping up the scenery

You gotta keep the piece, to keep the peace

Got dough, squad up and mopped the block up for a cleaning fee



I don't need you to change

I don't need you to change yourself (get, get away)

But I've got get away (get, get away)

But I've got get away from it all

And I am telling you once again

Just to remind you sweetheart that my



Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard

Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark

Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star

Life is one funny mothafucka

A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him

I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep

Introverted by my thoughts

Children listen, it gets deep

See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects

The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect

Adaptation inevitable, gun violence, crack spot

Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals

Anthony was the oldest of seven

Well respected, calm and collected

Laughin' and joking made life easier

Hard times, momma on crack

A four-year-old telling his nanny he needed her

His family history pimpin' and bangin'

He was meant to be dangerous

Clocked him a grip and start slangin'

Fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces

Even got some head from a smoker last weekend

Dodged a policeman workin' for his big homie

Small time hustler, graduated to a brick on him

Ten thousand dollars out of a project housing

That's on the daily, seen his first mil twenty years old

Had a couple of babies, had a couple of shooters

Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun

They assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it

That was back when he turned his back

And they killed his cousin

He beat the case and went back to hustlin'

Bird shufflin', Anthony rang

The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang

That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came

Circlin' parkin' lots and parking spots

And hoppin' out while harrasing the corner blocks

Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it

He brushed them off and walked back

To the Kentucky Fried Chicken

See at this chicken spot

There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot

With a curly top and a gap in his teeth

He worked the window, his name was Ducky

He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes

Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome

Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars

They had a son hoping that he'd see college

Hustlin' on the side with a nine to five to freak it

Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends

Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket

'Cross the street from the projects

Anthony planned to rob it

Stuck up the place before back in '84

That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war

So many relatives telling us, selling us devilish works

Killing us crime, intelligent, felonious

Prevalent proposition with nines

Ducky was well aware, they robbed the manager

And shot a customer last year

He figured he'd get on these niggas good sides

Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line

Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide

They didn't kill him, in fact it look like

They're the last to survive

Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives

One curse at a time, reverse the manifest

And good karma and I'll tell you why

You take two strangers

And put 'em in random predicaments

Give 'em a soul so they can

Make their own choices and live with it

Twenty years later them same strangers

You make 'em meet again

Inside recording studios where they reaping their benefits

Then you start reminding 'bout that chicken incident

Whoever thought the greatest rapper

Would be from coincidence

Because if Anthony killed Ducky

Top Dawg could be servin' life

While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight





So I was taking a walk the other day..."

Don't judge me, I was young, fucking all the brats

Don't judge me, aiming at your head for a stack

Don't judge me, don't judge me

Now my home got a Valley peak

Don't judge me, if I press your line, you a freak

Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon' see



This what God feel like, yeah

Laughing to the bank like aha, yeah

Flex on swole like aha, yeah

You feel some type of way then, aha, yeah



Fuck is you talking to?

Aye, do you know who you talking to?

Slide on you like fallen drapes

God toss full of carnivals

I kill 'em with kindness

Or I kill 'em with diamonds

Or I put up like fifteen hundred

Get your ass killed by the finest

Everything life is a gamble

Nothing in life I can't handle

Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more

For the cars, I done put blood on sword

Everything I do is to embrace y'all

Everything I write is a damn eight ball

Everything I touch is a damn gold mine

Everything I say is from an angel



I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit

Cannonballs to ignite shit

Morning to the night shift, I'm on

I ain't sorry for it, ask for a piece of mine

You charged me for it

I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it

I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it

I got a bad habit, levitate, ducking haters

Oh my, my heart is rich, my heart is famous



This what God feel like, yeah (this what God feel like)

Laughing to the bank like aha (this what God feel like)

Yeah (this what God feel like)

I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately and I know you feel like ya know people ain't been prayin' for you but you have to understand this man, that we are just people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, ""The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart."" See family that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way...
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?

Earth is no more, why don't you burn this mufucka?

I beat yo' ass, keep talkin' back

I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?

You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken

I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch

I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house with tears in your eyes

Runnin' from poopoo and 'prentice

Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil nigga

That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass

Yo' teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class

That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all

That TV better not be loud if you got it on

Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em

Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter

Better not hear you got caught up, I beat yo' ass

You better not run to your father, I beat yo' ass

You know my patience runnin' thin

I got beaucoup payments to make

County building's on my ass

Tryna take my food stamps away

I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here

I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here

Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?

Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else



If I can smoke fear away, I roll that motherfucker up

And then I take two puffs

I'm high now, I'm high now

I'm high now, I'm high now

Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now



(Think I can prolly find a way to make it on this earth)

I'll prolly die anonymous

I'll prolly die with promises

I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house

I'll prolly die 'cause these colors are standin' out

I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'

I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches

I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me false accused

I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool

Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra

Or maybe die because these smokers

Are more than desperate

I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges

Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'

Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax

Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast

I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments

I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'

I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17

All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things



If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up

And then I'd take two puffs

I've been hungry all my life

I'm high now, I'm high now

I'm high now, I'm high now

Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now, now



When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear

Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years

My newfound life made all of me magnified

How many accolades do I need to block denial?

The shock value of my success put bolts in me

All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?

Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job?

Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?

At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all

Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall

Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'

30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus

What is an advisor somebody that's holdin' my checks?

Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?

I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered

How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?

The type of shit'll make me flip out

And just kill somethin', drill somethin'

Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'

I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck

At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged

How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city

What they say 'bout me reveal

If my reputation would miss me

What they see from me

Would trickle down generations in time

What they hear from me

Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines



I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity

I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride

'cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God

I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone

I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more

I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness

Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive

Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth

And I can't take these feelings

With me so hopefully they disperse

Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax

Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back

Fear, what happens on earth stays on earth

And I can't take these feelings with me

So hopefully they disperse

Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax

Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap



Damn

Goddamn you

Goddamn me

Goddamn us

Goddamn we

Goddamn us all



Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna be in this place, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our inequities. For our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord thy God chasten you. So just like your children, your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom"

Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window

Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden

Go to the club, or your mama house

Whatever you doin' just make it count

I need some water

Wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up

Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up

Touchin' yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit

Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent

Hop on the 'gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you

Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you

Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce

I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night

Both in the trance, feelings I did, what a fast life

Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30

Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early

Room full of clothes, bag full of money, call it loose change

Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain

Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M

Take me a nap and do it again

We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news

Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true

All of us worried, all of us buried, and the feeling's deep

None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap

Stealed and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it

Think they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly

Time passin', things change

Revertin' back to our daily programs

Stuck in our ways, drones



Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame

Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame

Lately, lately, lately my lust been hiding (Lately)

Lately, it's all contradiction

Lately I'm not here

Lately, I lust over self

Lust turn into fear

Lately, in James 4:4 says

Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord

Brace yourself, lust is all yours



I need some water

Somethin' came over me

Way too high to simmer down

Might as well overheat

Too close to comfort

It wasn't all to share, but there

In another life, I surely was there

It wasn't all to share, but there

I care, I care



Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions

Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?

The better part, the human heart

You love 'em or dissect 'em

Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?

See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world

I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world

I don't love people enough to put my faith in man

I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend

I understand I ain't perfect

I probably won't come around

This time, I might put you down

Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now

My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb

I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from

Pity parties and functions and you and yours

A perfect world, you probably live another 24

I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure



It wasn't all to share, but there

In another life, I surely was there

It wasn't all to share, but there

I care, I care



Maybe I wasn't there

Maybe I wasn't there

Maybe I wasn't there

Maybe I wasn't there



Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive

Cold as December, but never remember what winter did

I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid

Seems like I point the finger just to make a point, nowadays

Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there

Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here

I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back

The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that

Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride

A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies

Promises are broken and more resentment come alive

Race barriers make inferior of you and I

See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches

I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison

I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service

Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world



It wasn't all to share, but there

In another life, I surely was there

It wasn't all to share, but there

If I gotta slap a pussy ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy

It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri

If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy

I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy

They won't take me out my element

Nah, take me out my element"

It wasn't all to share, but there

In another life, I surely was there

It wasn't all to share, but there

I care, I care



Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions

Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?

The better part, the human heart

You love 'em or dissect 'em

Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?

See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world

I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world

I don't love people enough to put my faith in man

I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend

I understand I ain't perfect

I probably won't come around

This time, I might put you down

Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now

My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb

I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from

Pity parties and functions and you and yours

A perfect world, you probably live another 24

I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

It wasn't all to share, but there

Maybe I wasn't there

Maybe I wasn't there

Maybe I wasn't there

Maybe I wasn't there



Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive

Cold as December, but never remember what winter did

I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid

Seems like I point the finger just to make a point, nowadays

Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there

Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here

I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back

The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that

Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride

A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies

Promises are broken and more resentment come alive

Race barriers make inferior of you and I

See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches

I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison

I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service

Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

Go to the club, or your mama house

Whatever you doin' just make it count

I need some water

Wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up

Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up

Touchin' yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit

Hop on the 'gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you

I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night

Both in the trance, feelings I did, what a fast life

Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30

Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early

Room full of clothes, bag full of money, call it loose change

Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain

Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M

Take me a nap and do it again

We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news

Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true

All of us worried, all of us buried, and the feeling's deep

None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap

Stealed and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it

Think they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly

Time passin', things change

Revertin' back to our daily programs

Stuck in our ways, drones



Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame

Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame

Lately, lately, lately my lust been hiding (Lately)

Lately, it's all contradiction

Lately I'm not here

Lately, I lust over self

Lust turn into fear

Lately, in James 4:4 says

Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord

Brace yourself, lust is all yours



I need some water

Somethin' came over me

Way too high to simmer down

Might as well overheat

Too close to comfort

I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?

You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken

I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch

I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house with tears in your eyes

Runnin' from poopoo and 'prentice

Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil nigga

That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass

Yo' teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class

That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all

That TV better not be loud if you got it on

Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em

Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter

Better not hear you got caught up, I beat yo' ass

You better not run to your father, I beat yo' ass

You know my patience runnin' thin

I got beaucoup payments to make

County building's on my ass

Tryna take my food stamps away

I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here

I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here

Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?

Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else



If I can smoke fear away, I roll that motherfucker up

I'm high now, I'm high now

Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now



(Think I can prolly find a way to make it on this earth)

I'll prolly die anonymous

I'll prolly die with promises

I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house

I'll prolly die 'cause these colors are standin' out

I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'

I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches

I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me false accused

I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool

Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra

Or maybe die because these smokers

Are more than desperate

I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges

Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'

Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax

Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast

I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments

I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'

I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17

All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things



If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up

When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear

Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years

My newfound life made all of me magnified

How many accolades do I need to block denial?

The shock value of my success put bolts in me

All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?

Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job?

Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?

At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all

Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall

Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'

30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus

What is an advisor somebody that's holdin' my checks?

Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?

I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered

How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?

The type of shit'll make me flip out

And just kill somethin', drill somethin'

Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'

I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck

At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged

How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city

What they say 'bout me reveal

If my reputation would miss me

What they see from me

Would trickle down generations in time

What they hear from me

Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines



I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity

I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride

'cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God

I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone

I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more

I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness

Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive

Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth

And I can't take these feelings

With me so hopefully they disperse

Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax

Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back

Fear, what happens on earth stays on earth

And I can't take these feelings with me

So hopefully they disperse

Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax

Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap



Damn

Goddamn you

Goddamn me

Goddamn us

Goddamn we

Goddamn us all



Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna be in this place, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our inequities. For our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord thy God chasten you. So just like your children, your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom"

Darling I told you many times

And I am telling you once again

Just to remind you sweetheart that my



Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard

Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark

Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star

Life is one funny mothafucka

A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him

I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep

Introverted by my thoughts

Children listen, it gets deep

See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects

The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect

Adaptation inevitable, gun violence, crack spot

Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals

Anthony was the oldest of seven

Well respected, calm and collected

Laughin' and joking made life easier

Hard times, momma on crack

A four-year-old telling his nanny he needed her

His family history pimpin' and bangin'

He was meant to be dangerous

Clocked him a grip and start slangin'

Fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces

Even got some head from a smoker last weekend

Dodged a policeman workin' for his big homie

Small time hustler, graduated to a brick on him

Ten thousand dollars out of a project housing

That's on the daily, seen his first mil twenty years old

Had a couple of babies, had a couple of shooters

Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun

They assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it

That was back when he turned his back

And they killed his cousin

He beat the case and went back to hustlin'

Bird shufflin', Anthony rang

The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang

That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came

Circlin' parkin' lots and parking spots

And hoppin' out while harrasing the corner blocks

Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it

He brushed them off and walked back

To the Kentucky Fried Chicken

See at this chicken spot

There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot

With a curly top and a gap in his teeth

He worked the window, his name was Ducky

He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes

Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome

Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars

They had a son hoping that he'd see college

Hustlin' on the side with a nine to five to freak it

Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends

Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket

'Cross the street from the projects

Anthony planned to rob it

Stuck up the place before back in '84

That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war

So many relatives telling us, selling us devilish works

Killing us crime, intelligent, felonious

Prevalent proposition with nines

Ducky was well aware, they robbed the manager

And shot a customer last year

He figured he'd get on these niggas good sides

Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line

Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide

They didn't kill him, in fact it look like

They're the last to survive

Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives

One curse at a time, reverse the manifest

And good karma and I'll tell you why

You take two strangers

And put 'em in random predicaments

Give 'em a soul so they can

Make their own choices and live with it

Twenty years later them same strangers

You make 'em meet again

Inside recording studios where they reaping their benefits

Then you start reminding 'bout that chicken incident

Whoever thought the greatest rapper

Would be from coincidence

Because if Anthony killed Ducky

Top Dawg could be servin' life

While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight





So I was taking a walk the other day..."

Black man taking no losses

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?

When you got the yams (What's the yams?)

The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor

Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

24/7, 365 days times two

I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage

Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say...

(You goat mouth mammy fucker)

I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves

Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help

This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail

If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left

Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' ""Compton""

I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest

And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too

Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!

Ah yeah, fuck the judge

I made it past 25 and there I was

A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him

Life ain't shit but a fat vagina

Screamin' ""Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?""

Limo tinted with the gold plates

Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast

From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king



Bitch where was you when I was-

(By the time you hear the next pop, 

the funk 

shall be within you)

Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta

Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, (King) Kunta

Black man taking no losses

If I was the president

I'd pay my mama's rent

Free my homies and them

Bulletproof my Chevy doors

Lay in the White House and get high, Lord

Who ever thought?

Master take the chains off me



Life can be like a box of chocolate

Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious

Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it

Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive

I can just alleviate the rap industry politics

Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant

The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious

Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges

Be all you can be, true, but the problem is

A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it

Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this

I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal

K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god

Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged

But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards

You lookin' at artists like the harvests

So many Rollies around you and you want all of them

Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry

I should've listened what my grandmama said to me



Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga

Oh now, slow down



And once upon a time in a city so divine

Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga

He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid

Took his homie to the show and this is what they said



What I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?

The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips

The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor

Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for

Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?

One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist

My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it

It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?

No more livin' poor, meet my .44

When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor

Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers

But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey

Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay

But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA

Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?

Well that's me at these awards

I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy

She said...



Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga

Oh now, slow down



And once upon a time in a city so divine

Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga

He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused

Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse

You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie

Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey

Hollywood's nervous

Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service"

If these walls could talk

I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it



If these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good

No boat I float better than he would

No life jacket I'm not the guard in Nazareth

But your flood can be misunderstood

Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment

Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension

Me? I'm just a tenant

My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute

These walls are vulnerable exclamation

Interior pink color coordinated

I interrogated every nook and cranny

I mean its still amazing before they couldn't stand me

Walls feeling like they ready to close in

I suffocate then catch my second wind

I resonate in these walls

I don't know how long I can wait in these walls

I've been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in

They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest

I beg to differ, I must've missed them

I'm not involved I'd rather diss them

I'd rather call all you put your wall up

Cause when I come around demolition gon' crush

If your walls could talk they'd tell you it's too late

Your destiny accepted your fate

Burn accessories and stash them where they are

Take the recipe, the bible and god

Wall telling you that commissary is low

Race wars happening no calling CO

No calling your mother to save you

Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable

Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch

Walls is telling me you a bitch

You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them

That sentence so important

Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""

Retaliation is strong you even dream about me

Killed my homeboy and God spared your life

Dumb criminal got indicted the same night

So when you play this song rewind the first verse

About me abusing my power so you can hurt

About me and her in the shower whenever she horny

About me and her in the after hours of the morning

About her baby daddy currently serving life

And how she think about you until we meet up at night

About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her

And how she fucking on a famous rapper

Walls could talk

Misusing your influence

Sometimes I did the same

Abusing my power full of resentment

No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it

I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it

Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it

Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out

You was deserted, where was your antennas again?

Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?

You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend

A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend

Little brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him

Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches

You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven

You even faced time instead of a hospital visit

You should thought he would recover, well

The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real

Then he died, God himself will say ""you fuckin' failed""

I know your secrets

Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'

And that time you I'm bout to hurl

I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you

You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof

You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago

Run a number on man and woman that crossed him

Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted

Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles

Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'

He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language

You just forgot because of what public schools had painted

Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous

I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin'

But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it

It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor

Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress

And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil

You spoiled by fantasies of who you are

I feel bad for you

I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you

If you resist, I'll back off go catch a flight or two

Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black

Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin'

Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum

Y'all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit

Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since

Don't ask about no camera back at award shows

No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my foes

'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it

I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button

Had the Coast on standby

K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box

I box em all in, by a landslide

Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets

I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats

But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay

He said ""it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game""



I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo!



I remember you was conflicted

Misusing your influence

Sometimes I did the same

Abusing my power full of resentment

Resentment that turned into a deep depression

Found myself screaming in a hotel room

I didn't want to self-destruct

The evils of Lucy was all around me

So I went running for answers

Until I came home

But that didn't stop survivors guilt

Going back and forth

Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned

Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was

But while my loved ones was fighting

A continuous war back in the city

I was entering a new one"

The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo

20 years ago, can't forget

Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals

Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do

20 on 6, he didn't hear me

Indigenous African only spoke Zulu

My American tongue was slurry

Walked out the gas station

A homeless man with a silly tan complexion

Asked me for ten rand

Stressin' about dry land

Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open

A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'

He begged and pleaded

Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it

Told him, ""Beat it""

Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it

He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated

Listen to me, I want a single bill from you

Nothin' less, nothin' more""

I told him I ain't have it and closed my door

Tell me how much a dollar cost



It's more to feed your mind

Water, sun and love, the one you love

All you need, the air you breathe



He's starin' at me in disbelief

My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key

He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave

And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see

The reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him

Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor

He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser

He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious

Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect

If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck

I never understood someone beggin' for goods

Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could

And this particular person just had it down pat

Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked

Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?

A humble man is all that we ever need

Tell me how much a dollar cost



It's more to feed your mind

Water, sun and love, the one you love

All you need, the air you breathe



Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment

I never met a transient that demanded attention

They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'

Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different

I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless

My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?

So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies

I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time

I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'

Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise

Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine

Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin

Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin'

Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal

Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up

I seen you from a mile away losin' focus

And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy

You looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""

I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""

He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free

You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power

The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve

Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost

The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God""



I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?

Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be

Shades of grey will never change if I condone

Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs"

So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival

Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival

Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken

By different shades of faces

Then with told me, ""A woman is woman, love the creation""

It all came from God then you was my confirmation

I came to where you reside

And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes

Let me talk my Stu Scott, scuse me on my 2Pac

Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die

Color of your skin, color of your eyes

That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby

You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey

All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave

12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark

I love myself, I no longer need Cupid

Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas

Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid

And frame of mind for them bustas, ain't talkin' Woohah!

Need a paradox for the pair of daughters they tutored

Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times

If you don't see you beautiful in your complexion

It ain't complex to put it in context

Find the air beneath the kite, that's the context

Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest

If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed

Ain't no stress, jigga boos wanna be

I ain't talkin' Jay, I ain't talkin' B

I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens

And spike your self esteem

The new James Bond gon' be black as me

Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea

And it's all beautiful to me

Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens

We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain't a thing



Barefoot babies with no cares

Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car?

I don't see Compton, I see something much worse

The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth"

Six in the mornin', fire in the street

And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain

It's such a shame they may call me crazy

They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'

But homie you made me

Black don't crack my nigga



I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015

Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean

Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses

You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it

I'm African-American, I'm African

I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village

Pardon my residence

Came from the bottom of mankind

My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide

You hate me don't you?

You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture

You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey

You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me

And this is more than confession

I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion

I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it

You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'

You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga



The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot



I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black

Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black

And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black

Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks

How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back

But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block

All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black

Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that



I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015

Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean

I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society

That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me

Curse me till I'm dead

Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head

Institutionalize manipulation and lies

Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes

You hate me don't you?

I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself

Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt

Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out

Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah

Black and successful, this black man meant to be special

Katzkins on my radar bitch, how can I help you?

How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?

You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015

When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree

This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred

It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification

I'm African-American, I'm African

I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan

I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius

Excuse my French but fuck you  no, fuck y'all

That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?

You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you

I can tell cause your ways deceitful

Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle

Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him

It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war

Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy

Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door

Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score

So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers

Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""

Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day

Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays

Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements

Or watch BET cause urban support is important

So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?

When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

Trial, tribulation, but I know God

The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie

Pray that the holy water don't go dry

As I look around me

So many motherfuckers wanna down me

But an enemigo never drown me

In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

And a gun in the hood and a mob of police

And a rock on the corner and a line for the fiend

And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scene yup

These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation

I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis

Dreams of reality's peace

Blow steam in the face of the beast

Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)

Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)

Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart

On my sleeve, let the runway start

You know the miserable do love company

What do you want from me and my scars?

Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence

How many times my potential was anonymous?

How many times the city making me promises?

So I promise this, nigga!

With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic

I'ma do it till I get it right

I went to war last night

I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent

Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message

I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave

From a negative and letting them annihilate me

And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed

Finna run into a building, lay my body...

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""

He said ""think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'""

No better than Samuel on D'Jango

No better than a white man with slave boats

Sound like I needed some soul searching

My pops gave me some game in real person

Retrace my steps on what they never taught me

Did my home work fast before governement caught me

So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah

On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us

So many artist gave her an explanation to hold us

Well this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia

N-E-G-U-S definition: royality King royalty - wait listen

N-E-G-U-S description: Black emperor, King, ruler, now let me finish

The history books overlooked the word and hide it

America tried to make it to a house divided

The homies don't recognize we be using it wrong

So I'ma break it down and put my game in the song

N-E-G-U-S, say it with me

Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me

Take it from Oprah Winfrey

Tell her she right on time

How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?

How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness?

""I remember you was conflicted

Misusing your influence

Sometimes I did the same

Abusing my power, full of resentment

Resentment that turned into a deep depression

Found myself screaming in the hotel room

I didn't wanna self destruct

The evils of Lucy was all around me

So I went running for answers

Until I came home

But that didn't stop survivor's guilt

Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned

Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was

But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one

A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination

Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned

The word was respect

Just because you wore a different gang colour than mine's

Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man

Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets

If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us

But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga



Shit and that's all I wrote

I was gonna call it Another Nigga but,

it ain't really a poem,

I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to. 

Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you,

I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--,

about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground.

What you mean bout that, what the ground represent?



The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil



Right



That's how I see it, my word is bond.

I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people,

the poor people is gonna open up this whole world

and swallow up the rich people. 

Cause the rich people gonna be so fat,

they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying,

wealthy, appetising.

The poor gonna be so poor and hungry,

you know what I'm saying it's gonna be like

there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich



Aight so let me ask you this then,

do you see yourself as somebody that's rich

or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?



I see myself as a natural born hustler,

a true hustler in every sense of the word.

I took nothin', I took the opportunities,

I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it.

I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company.

I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire.

I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself,

you know what I'm saying.

I made millions for the record companies,

I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us



And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?



By my faith in God, by my faith in the game,

and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true.

You know what I'm saying,

and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying,

I was noticing, shit, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening.

So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know.

I'm finna go straight through



Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart

or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?



Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity

I've ever been threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance. 

And not only me but it goes down my family tree. 

You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back



Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like,

we fighting a war,

I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down



In this country a black man only have like 5 years

we can exhibit maximum strength,

and that's right now while you a teenager,

while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights,

while you still wanna shoot back.

Cause once you turn 30

it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man,

out of a black man in this country.

And you don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas



That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind

I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on

so I wanted to ask you what you think

is the future for me and my generation today?



I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores

and next time it's a riot there's gonna be bloodshed for real.

I don't think America can know that.

I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing.

It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying,

it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka.

You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen



That's crazy man.

In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations,

lotta people don't understand how important it is.

Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic

and I don't know what type of energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from.

Trip me out sometimes



Because the spirits, we ain't really rappin',

we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us



Damn



I wanted to read one last thing to you.

It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says:



The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it

Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, 

in order to protect itself from this mad city

While consuming its environment the caterpillar 

begins to notice ways to survive

One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, 

but praises the butterfly

The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, 

and the beauty within the caterpillar

But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits

Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work 

on the cocoon which institutionalizes him

He can no longer see past his own thoughts

He's trapped

When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, 

such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city

The result?

Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant

Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations

that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle

Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different,

they are one and the same.""



What's your perspective on that?

Pac, Pac, Pac"

And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed

And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record

That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her

She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing

A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federals roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches in trouble
I hope the universe love you today

'cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away a flock of positive activist a filthy body would hate

If it's necessary

Bumping jeezy first album looking distracted

Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent

The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it

Hotboxing like george foreman grilling the masses

Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls

And asked them what they working with - look at me

I got the blunt in my mouth

Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies



(yea nigga, we off a pill and remy red

Come through and bust ya head nigga)

Me and the homies

(sag all the way to the liquor store

Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)

Me and the homies

(i ride for my mothafuckin' niggas

Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)

Me and the homies

(matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like

""doo! doo! doo! doo!...doo! doo! doo! doo! doo!"")



It's 2:30 and the sun is beaming

Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming

Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me

I'll tell you to suck my dick and then I'll continue eating

We speeding on the 405 passing westchester

You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good lord

They knew we weren't from 'round there

'cause every time we down there we pulling out the boost mobile sim cards

Bougie bitches with no extensions

Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination

Before we sparked a conversation

We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating

I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the funk neither

I really doubt it

Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it

That's ironic 'cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies



(just ridin', just ridin')

Me and the homies

(bullshittin', actin' a fool)

Me and the homies

(trippin', really trippin')

Me and the homies

(just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'...)



Bragging 'bout the episode we just had

A shot of hennessey didn't make me feel that bad

I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma

Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you

We tryna conquer the city with disobedience

Quick to turn it up, beefing if we ain't got the cd in

But jeezy still playing and our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you saying""

Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months

The sun is going down as we take whatever we want

I hit the back window in search of any nintendo

Dvds, plasma screen tvs in the trunk

We made a right, then made a left made a right

Then made a left, we was just circling life

My mama called - ""kicking it""

I should've told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense with the homies



But they made a right, they made a left then made a right

Then another right

One lucky night with the homies



(and this is the art of peer pressure, this is the art of peer pressure)

Me and the homies

(this is the art of peer pressure, this is the art of peer pressure)

When you figure out it's all right here in the city

And you don't run from where we come from

And your dog has to say woof

And you ask ""lift up your shirt""

Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through

Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile

Of everything that you love, you love beef

The reason why I know you very well

Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell

The days I tried to cover up and conceal

My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal

When living in a world that come with plan B

A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free

And plan C just an excuse like because

I love them, I love when I love her

I love so much, I love when love hurts

I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract

I love second verse cause you're the homie they packed

Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch

In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else

But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself

To the point I should hate everything I do love

Should I hate living my life inside the club

Should I hate her for watching me for that reason

Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season

Should I hate them for telling me ball out

Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about

But look, you take this music business serious,

and put out something me and your dad can step to.

Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton.

Let 'em know you was just like them,

but you still rose from that dark place of violence,

becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back,

with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back.

To your city...

And I love you Kendrick,

This is king Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master and dodging your honor

And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like 5 in the morning

Then ring your spot while Kendrick's performing

And if they take everything, know I got



Compton, compton, ain't no city quite like mine



(ay, dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!)

Still I'm mad, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic

Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging

When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the back

With a batch of them bangin' dre beats with me, look where I'm at

It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birth of this gangster rap

It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month

To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from



Compton, compton, ain't no city quite like mine



So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman

Won't you spend a weekend on rosecrans nigga

Khaki creasing, crime increasing on rosecrans nigga

Kendrick conan nigga

Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that

I do it big as rasputia (?) kama sutra scream fuck your position

And make you hold that

I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats

But I know flats and piru crip tats



(will swarm on me like a beehive

Hop in the g ride

From the west to the east side

Know that's just how compton roll)



And that's a given

I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision

I crash the porsce then you report that you see me in benzes

I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it

(then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business

I blow up every time we throw up a record

Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion

Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)



Compton, compton, ain't no city quite like mine



So tell that gangster throw his set high

Roll it up in a blunt, i'mma take you on the next high

I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly

In my direction, you never questioned when I said I

Would be a mogul before I visit 2pac and left-eye

Eazy and aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive

A lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye

Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby



Compton, compton, ain't no city quite like mine



Now we can all celebrate

We can all harvest the rap artists of nwa

America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate

Harsh realities we in made our music translate

To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play

With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay

Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay

This was brought to you by dre

Now every motherfucker in here say:

""look who's responsible for taking compton international

I make 'em holla"""

I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower

So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation

Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing

Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked

And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas

Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this

Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken

All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress

Respect my mind or die from lead showers



I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir

Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher

And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure

And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed

And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record

That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her

She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing

This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and

And I run at ho with a baton

That's a relay race with a bouquet

They say, ""K, you going marry mines""

A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federals roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches in trouble
I hope the universe love you today

'cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away a flock of positive activist a filthy body would hate

If it's necessary

Bumping jeezy first album looking distracted

Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent

The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it

Hotboxing like george foreman grilling the masses

Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls

And asked them what they working with - look at me

I got the blunt in my mouth

Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies



(yea nigga, we off a pill and remy red

Come through and bust ya head nigga)

Me and the homies

(sag all the way to the liquor store

Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)

Me and the homies

(i ride for my mothafuckin' niggas

Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)

Me and the homies

(matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like

""doo! doo! doo! doo!...doo! doo! doo! doo! doo!"")



It's 2:30 and the sun is beaming

Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming

Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me

I'll tell you to suck my dick and then I'll continue eating

We speeding on the 405 passing westchester

You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good lord

They knew we weren't from 'round there

'cause every time we down there we pulling out the boost mobile sim cards

Bougie bitches with no extensions

Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination

Before we sparked a conversation

We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating

I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the funk neither

I really doubt it

Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it

That's ironic 'cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies



(just ridin', just ridin')

Me and the homies

(bullshittin', actin' a fool)

Me and the homies

(trippin', really trippin')

Me and the homies

(just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'...)



Bragging 'bout the episode we just had

A shot of hennessey didn't make me feel that bad

I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma

Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you

We tryna conquer the city with disobedience

Quick to turn it up, beefing if we ain't got the cd in

But jeezy still playing and our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you saying""

Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months

The sun is going down as we take whatever we want

I hit the back window in search of any nintendo

Dvds, plasma screen tvs in the trunk

We made a right, then made a left made a right

Then made a left, we was just circling life

My mama called - ""kicking it""

I should've told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense with the homies



But they made a right, they made a left then made a right

Then another right

One lucky night with the homies



(and this is the art of peer pressure, this is the art of peer pressure)

Me and the homies

(this is the art of peer pressure, this is the art of peer pressure)

Of a prisoner on his way

Trapped inside your desire

To fire bullets that stray

I should ask a choir what do you require

To sing a song that acquire me to have faith

As the record spin I should pray

For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey

I got animosity building

It's probably big as a building

Me jumping off of the roof

Is me just playing it safe

But what am I supposed to do

When the topic is red or blue

And you understand that I ain't

But know I'm accustomed to

Just a couple that look for trouble

And live in the street with rank

No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study

And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face

I can never pick out the difference

And grade a cop on the bill

Every time you clock in the morning

I feel you just want to kill

All my innocence while ignoring my purpose

To persevere as a better person

I know you heard this and probably in fear

But what am I supposed to do

With the blinking of red and blue

Flash from the top of your roof

And your dog has to say woof

And you ask ""lift up your shirt""

Cause you wonder if a tattoo

Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through

Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile

I heard them chatter: ""He's probably young but I know that he's down""

20 Xanies and these 'shrooms

Grown-up candy for pain

Can we live in the same society

It's entirely stressful upon my brain

You hired me as a victim

I quietly hope for change

When violence is the rhythm

Inspired me to obtain

The silence in this room

With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms

Some grown-up candy I lost it

I feel it's nothing to lose

I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I...
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real



I promise that I know you very well

Your eyes never lie even if they tell

Sweet lullabies that come with a smell

Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill

You living in a world that come with plan B

Cause plan A never relay a guarantee

And plan C never could say just what it was

And your plans only can pan around love

You love him, you love them, you love her

You love so much, you love when love hurts

You love red-bottom and gold they say queen

You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean

You love french tip and trip that pay for

You love bank slip that tell you we paid more

You love a good hand whenever the card dealt

But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself



I do what I wanna do

I say what I wanna say

When I feel, and I...

Look in the mirror and know I'm there

With my hands in the air

I'm proud to say yea

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

Cause before you know it everything's gone



I promise that I know you very well

Your eyes never lie even if they fell

Out the sky and your optics turn stale

Where they mow that's green

I can see you fit the bill

Of living in a world that come with plan B

Cause plan A only can make another mistake

And you can't see success coming from plan C

When it all breaks you, you still say you're lovely

And love them and love when you love her

You love so much, you love when love hurts

You love fast cars and dead presidents old

You love fast women, you love keepin' control

Of everything that you love, you love beef

You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police

You love your hood, might even love it to death

But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?



I do what I wanna do

I say what I wanna say

When I feel, and I...

Look in the mirror and know I'm there

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

Cause before you know it everything's gone



The reason why I know you very well

Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell

The days I tried to cover up and conceal

My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal

When living in a world that come with plan B

A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free

And plan C just an excuse like because

Or the word ""but"", but what if I got love

I love them, I love when I love her

I love so much, I love when love hurts

I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract

I love second verse cause you're the homie they packed

Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch

I love what the both of you have to offer

In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else

But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself

To the point I should hate everything I do love

Should I hate living my life inside the club

Should I hate her for watching me for that reason

Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season

Should I hate them for telling me ball out

Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about

Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will

Or hatin' the fact none of that sh*t make me real



""I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore,

just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy,

but don't learn the hard way like I did homie.

Any n*gga can kill a man, that don't make you a real n*gga.

Realness is responsibility, realness is taking care of your motherf*cking family,

realness is God, n*gga""

Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too.

I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio.

But look, you take this music business serious,

Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us

And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like 5 in the morning

And if they take everything, know I got

(ay, dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!)

Still I'm mad, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic

Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging

When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the back

With a batch of them bangin' dre beats with me, look where I'm at

It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birth of this gangster rap

It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month

To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from



Compton, compton, ain't no city quite like mine



So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman

Won't you spend a weekend on rosecrans nigga

Khaki creasing, crime increasing on rosecrans nigga

Kendrick conan nigga

Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that

I do it big as rasputia (?) kama sutra scream fuck your position

And make you hold that

I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats

But I know flats and piru crip tats



(will swarm on me like a beehive

Hop in the g ride

From the west to the east side

Know that's just how compton roll)



And that's a given

I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision

I crash the porsce then you report that you see me in benzes

I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it

(then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business

I blow up every time we throw up a record

Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion

Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)



Compton, compton, ain't no city quite like mine



So tell that gangster throw his set high

Roll it up in a blunt, i'mma take you on the next high

I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly

In my direction, you never questioned when I said I

Would be a mogul before I visit 2pac and left-eye

Eazy and aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive

A lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye

Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby



Compton, compton, ain't no city quite like mine



Now we can all celebrate

We can all harvest the rap artists of nwa

America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate

Harsh realities we in made our music translate

To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play

With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay

Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay

This was brought to you by dre

Now every motherfucker in here say:

""look who's responsible for taking compton international

I make 'em holla"""

And she be low-key
Looking like a star
With a real nice car
A Mercedes key

And she got a nigga

And she love this nigga

Well, at least I think

Everytime we bark

She pay us no mind

In the middle of the street

She be like:



Fuck them other niggas cause

I'm down for my nigga

Fuck them other niggas cause

I'm down for my nigga

Fuck them other niggas

I'll ride for my nigga

I'll die for my nigga

Fuck them other...



Until one day he wasn't acting right

In the middle of the night

She checked his phone, Erica, right

When he plead the fifth, man, it was on

Matter of fact she gone

Matter of fact Tyrone

Was on speed dial, so when she got home

It was going down, she go:



Fuck that other nigga

When she tired of her nigga

Fuck that other nigga

When she tired of her nigga

Fuck that other nigga

When she tired of her nigga

Sick of lies from her nigga

Fuck that other...



I know this girl

She a real hood girl

And she with the shit

Keep her hair tied up

Big bamboos

Mike Jordan kicks with that

Big butt, but when I try

To holla, she don't exist

In her man she trust

So when I holla

She'll be screaming out she'll be like:



Fuck them other niggas cause

I'm down for my nigga

Fuck them other niggas cause

I'm down for my nigga

Fuck them other niggas

I'll ride for my nigga

I'll die for my nigga

Until one day he wasn't acting right

In the middle of the night

She checked his pockets

Found condoms by Magnum

And the moment they was acknowledged

She popped his eye

Then ran outside

Then started driving

On the passenger side

Homeboy was smiling, she go:



Fuck that other nigga

When she tired of her nigga

Fuck that other nigga

When she tired of her nigga

Fuck that other nigga

When she tired of her nigga

Sick of lies from her nigga

Fuck that other...



And so, these girls

These vulnerable girls

Took they men up

Put em in their world

Their vulnerable world

And just like that it was

Only getting they feelings hurt

Tell me how that sound?

They got fed up with the

Biggest question mark

They curious now

Cause when women get sick of men

They think of a big helping hand

To lend each other under cover emotions when lights dim

So when she telling her to come over

It'll be alright

The minute she hit the block

And turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go:



Fuck with other bitches

When they tired of these niggas

Fuck with other bitches

When they tired of these niggas

Fuck with other bitches

On the side cause these niggas...

Way after elementary

Thought it was cool to look the judge

In the face while he sentenced me

Since my uncles was institutionalized

My intuition has said I was suited for family ties

My mama is stressing, my daddy tired

I need me a weapon, these niggas ride

Every minute, hour and second. ministers tried

To save me. how I'm gonna listen

When I don't even hear god?

Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts

My hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink

You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga

The same nigga that killed with ya, squealed with ya

I deal with ya like my son

Stare at the sun and you'll be lookin

In my eyes homie. stand for something

Or fall for anything, and you working

With two left feet at the skating rink

But anyway, this for my niggas

I want you to know that I'm so determined

To blow, that you hear the music

That same nigga that kill with ya, will squeal with ya

I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya

Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya

I'm 23 with morals and plans of living cordial

Not rich, but wealthy

There's nothing you can tell me

My killings are not remorseful

The city got my back before that, I give them my torso

You think about it, and don't call me lyrical

Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual

I know some rappers using big words

To make their similes curve

My simplest shit be more pivotal

I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals

Worry some individuals that live life critical

So won't you bare witness while I bare feet

So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me

On 'wanna be heard, ' probably thought he worked my nerves

But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved

He ain't know I was ready for

And drop grams in it, he'll probably be

know what I'm talking 'bout?

Doing my thing, cause I'm rotating

when my speakers thumping from the Windy City streets

all the way out here to the streets of Compton,

know what I'm talking 'bout?

Church is definitely on the move

and we gonna continue to hustle and grow and develop by fire,

as I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar,

you know what I'm talking 'bout?

This is the ism this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?

You gotta get up off your ass and get it, man.

That's the only way your pockets gonna expand.

I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?

Apply yourself to supply your wealth,

only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself.

Church is definitely on the move,

you know what I'm talking 'bout?

Exercise your ism and don't depend on no one else,

In time you'll learn this is about you
In time you'll learn this is about you

Babies from 80's don't know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance

But the belligerent kids that we living with

Some of them masculine, some of them feminine

'member the universe used to be innocent

Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants

Everyday that I wake up, I'mma sin again

I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80

Good. Leave everything on the table now.

Flagging down all of these flashy cars

And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles

Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more

She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper

Bumping ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" while a pervert yelling at her

And she capture features of a woman, but only 17

The 7 cars start honking, she start running like Flo-Jo

Don't care if they Joe Blow

If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go

And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars

She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father, that's ironic

See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked

In her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where

Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat

Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet



Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard

Flagging down all of these flashy cars



And Lord knows she's beautiful

Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore

Her anatomy is God's temple

And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed

She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets

Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys

Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen

What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise

She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him

A warm welcome that filled him right below the navel

Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables

His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em

It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked

And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where

Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat

Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police



Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard

Flagging down all of these flashy cars



And Lord knows she's beautiful

Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore

As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour

She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure

Of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction

At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it

Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it

But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption

That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother

For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover

Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her

This mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that

Block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino park

And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where

Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat

And caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street

Keisha's song



My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face

The day that I wrote this song, set her down and pressed play

I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined

I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit then I decline

I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9

And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky

And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply

And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite

And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride

Or knuckle up, if you could fight, we always making 'em duck or die

A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide

CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite

(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me

Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony

Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70's

Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me

Dead 'em all and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail

To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe

I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA

My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor

We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster

Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty

And it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come

A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to me 'bout no money

The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete

I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks

And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC, really ballistic

Anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see some persistence

Recognize I be really too vicious the permanent beast

And the demolition breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T

And I gon' mention how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry

Everybody bitching, getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery

And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity

Of y'all fucks never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

I puff squares, but I swear one day I'mma stop my nerves itch

On the brink of my career, while my peers struggle for employment

Can you hear these screams (Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me)

One two, three four grams and a fifth of Hennessey

Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell



Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in

you vote for the better man

Unify people they going to peep it universally

We might not change the world

But we going to manipulate it, I hope you participating

Ayo Dot, won't you let these cats know

We knew we'd be here, like back in 04'

Started HiiiPower because our generation

Needed a generator and a system, meant to disintegrate us

And all we do is assist them

We're not victors, we're victims

The bigger picture hasn't developed yet

Like what if Keisha were celibate

What if Tammy came across a real man

Who didn't play games like children

My nigga cheated on his girlfriend with his girlfriend's girlfriend

Let the world end

And everybody tripping off 2012

And the extraterrestrial presence as well (Odd Future's aight)

But our future is not, that Martial law shit dropped, we gonna all get got

So keep that question mark on your face

Eat that fast food, and use that flouride toothpaste

Hide your feelings from the public

Work a little nine to five, don't forget to pay your tithes

And to thank God you're alive (HiiiPower)

Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree

And do exactly what you see on TV



True story, hmm, can you repeat that for me Soul



What's your life about, enlighten me

Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet

Is you gonna plead the fifth, or sound the horn

The time is now my child, come on



See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar

Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes

God and history all in the same sentence

You know what all the things have in common

Only half of the truth, if you tell it

See I've spent twenty three years on the earth searching for answers

'til one day I realized I had to come up with my own

I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on the inside looking out

I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around

You've ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man

That's an analogy for the way the world make me react

My innocence been dead

So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes

God and history all in the same sentence

Just know I meant it, and you felt it cause you too are searching for answers

I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper

I am a human mothafuckin' being, over dope ass instrumentation

Kendrick Lamar, now fuck 'em up Terrace (Soul!)



I watch this fire that we're gathered around

And see that it burns similar to the fire that's inside you

Section.80

Section.80 babies

A generation of bliss and disobedience

Know they can't control us

Know they can't control you

Know they can't control us

But we can control each other

We build our own world

If you don't leave with nothing else tonight,

you will leave with knowing yourself

You will leave knowing that you represent

something thats bigger than all of us

Our family

Heart, honor and respect

Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me

I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone

Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone

You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc

You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick

Grown men never should bite their tongue

Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum

I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol

Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you

My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise

How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental

This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it

You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it

And everything on TV just a figment of imagination

I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian

While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship

Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs



Just call the shit HiiiPower

Nigga nothing less than HiiiPower

Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches

I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid

You can't resist his HiiiPower

Throw your hands up for HiiiPower



Visions of Martin Luther staring at me

If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy

Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek

They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh

And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh

Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh

Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard

He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs

Frightening, so fucking frightening

Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill

I'm standing on the field full of land mines

Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time

Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend

Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind

Who said a black man in the Illuminati?

Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party

So get up off that slave ship

Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs



Just call the shit HiiiPower

We fight the system (Never like the system)

We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na



Who said a black man in the Illuminati?

Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party

Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey

On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi

And I want everybody to view my autopsy

So you can see exactly where the government had shot me

No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable

They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal

Frightening, so fucking frightening

Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane

The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain

Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy

Product of the late 80's

Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy

Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off

Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost

Cause we been off them slave ships

Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs



Just call the shit HiiiPower

tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic

give me respect, dammit, or get damaged

die young, corpse identified by your parents

apparently you're a parrot

mocking me and my blueprint

but i won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff

rappers need to go call

ghostbusters to shoot busters i'm casper when i go off

i show up, to show out to show off

you a hundred percent behind me

and if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene

i remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me

Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot

On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell

The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled

Everyone I knew was either crip or piru

Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school

With that being said, each one of their rivals

Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival

Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back

And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes

In the midst of staying neutral and discrete

My momma said you're judged by the company you keep

But what you can consider, that if it goes down

They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga

So if you ask what I'm doing

I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and, real talk, and



[Chorus]

This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)

This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?)

I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)

But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know



I was walking from Centennial

When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hol' up

Where you from? ""I don't bang""

Where you stay? ""Westside"", that's a piru gang to be exact

Well aware they had blue across they hat

Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac

Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet

Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet

Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew

What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage

Never seen that many guns in my life

I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge

Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in

Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer

You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you

Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but



[Chorus]



I don't do black music, I don't do white music

I do everyday life music

Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it

You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold

And this is for my county building children

In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering

I use perseverance in this mad city

Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats

Bernie Mac died, it's no joke

Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves

Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life

I could fall out the sky like twice

And land in the land of the AKs

And the minivans where the fan never on

Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket

In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know?



[Chorus]



So there you have it

But I'mma leave you with this

An O.G. once told me

A real gangster is either dead or in jail

Or behind the scenes getting real money

I'm gone"

You boo boooo, you T'd, you turnt down, you thirstyyy, you boo boooo! unh,
[Verse 1:]
I'm tryna learn somethin new.
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searchin deep for Kendrick Lamar,

I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God,

They say he the key to my blessings...

And if I speak the good into existance, that instant my dreams will unlock,

Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock.

And by the way I'm a start,

Findin more light to shed,

Like a small garage in yo backyard.

I'm back chillin with a friend of mine.

She mighty fine but I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness.

Always hollerin who she don't like, and who she kick it with,

Who she wanna fight, who wearin a weave, who Dooney&Bourke bag is fake, who holdin the keys to the car she drove last year,

Or who fuckin on who, and who need a pap smear.

Gettin on my nerves, but before yo negative energy curve, bitch I'm a cut you off.



[Chorus:]

Cause everytime you come around,

You be hollerin that whoop de whoooop, blah ze blaaaah, he say/she say, oh my God

Shut the fuck up!

... hoe.

Everytime you come around,

You be hollerin that whoop de whooop, blah ze blaaaah, he say/she say...



[Verse 2:]

Unh,

I'm tryna learn somethin new.

I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me.

Or at least inquire similar desires

To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P.

I'm talkin ideas, motivation

It's more than making, enemies, my nigga.

Oh that's not your memo?

Then tell me why you constantly stressin on how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga [?]

I function with you and you flaunt your pistol

Every second tell me how you pressed em at the Monte Crystal.

Where so&so from, and what neighborhoods beefin,

Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend.

That shit is mad depressin, bringin me down.

Speak on somethin with some substance that can get us both paid rather than tellin me how these niggas jockin yo style,

Or his rims ain't bigga.

Pussy nigga,

I'm a cut you off.



[Chorus:]

Cause everytime you come around,

You be hollerin that whoop de whoooop, blah ze blaaaah, he say/she say, oh my God

Shut the fuck up!

... scary ass!

Everytime you come around,

You be hollerin that whoop de whoooop, blah ze blaaah, he say/she say...



[Verse 3:]

I'm tryna learn somethin new.

I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star.

I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa, studying art.

Now paint that picture.

Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?

I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?

See what I was taught,

Family is all I need but indeed them too can run me right up a tree.

Constantly talkin shit 'bout the next relative,

Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in.

Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways.

Argue on holidays,

Left my uncle in prison for 15 years no one paid,

Him attention but moms, yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come.

Come to my house just to yap bout your own people... dang,

And if yo blood wasn't runnin through my veins I would prolly cut ya'll off... too! yep.



[Chorus:]

Cause everytime ya'll come around,

Ya'll be hollerin that whoop de whoooop, blah ze blaaah, he say/she say, oh my God

Shut the fuck up!

(Keep it runnin Ali)

Everytime you come around,

You be hollerin that whoop de whooop, blah ze blaaah, he say/she say...



[Breakdown:]

So tell em, ""shut the fuck up! ""

Tell em, ""shut the fuck up! ""

Yeah bitch you boo boooo, you T'd, you turnt dowwwnnn, you thirstyyy.



Tell em, ""shut the fuck up.""

Tell em, ""shut the fuck up! ""

Yeah nigga you boo booo, you T'd, you turnt dowwwnnn, you thirstyyyy.



You thirstyyyyy, you boo booo, you T'd, you turnt dowwwnnn,

You boo booo, you T'd, you boo boooo, you turnt dowwwnnn,

You thirstyyy, you T'd, you boo boooo, you turnt downnn...

You boo boooo, you T'd, you turnt downnn,

You weeeaaakk, you weeaakkk, yo bitch weeeaakkk, yo... hahahaha. you boo boooo, you T'd.



Keep all that."
