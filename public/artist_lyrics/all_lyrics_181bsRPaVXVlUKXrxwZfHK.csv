This shit come with the fame, that's how I knew that I made it
I woke up lookin' this good, I'm in my prime, these niggas gotta get played
If these bitches ain't mad, I need to go harder, I can't let 'em think we the same
Ass sittin' up like a horse's, pretty like a portrait, mouth full of diamonds and porcelain

Bitch, I know I'm gorgeous, lil' bitty waist, big titties, I don't need no corset

Rich off these endorsements, y'all hoes lazy, always worried 'bout a boyfriend

Pockets gettin' thickеr and thicker, I'm tastin' the money, it look likе I ate a few hundreds

I just hopped on a G6, I'm gettin' head while I'm playin' my Switch, hm

This nigga found out about that nigga, I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm a pimp, hm

Bitch, I look good in throwbacks, I look good chubby, I look good slim, hm

Ignorin' the haters that speak on my body, this pussy ain't for none of them

I pull a hoe scalp back, like a scrunchie, tuned in, you's gotta be monthly

A bum bitch can't get in my company

Surrounded by sauce like I'm reppin' my country

Projection, whole lotta projectin'

You do the shit that you put on the next bitch

Bet against me, fuck up your parlay

Niggas know I'm the biggest investment, hm, ayy

I don't wanna take no pictures, I don't get along with these out here bitches, hm

I don't even know this hoe but the bitch keep beggin' me for attention, hm

This pimp shit ain't nothin' new to me, I knew he was for community

These hoes love to stick around and get they heart broke

I'ma bounce on a nigga like booty cheeks

Slide down on the dick like new sheets

Talk him through it, let him know what to do to me

Y'all hoes treat a nigga like a death row meal, I treat niggas like charcuterie (Ah)

Self-made, and sensual, and I'm always on point like a decimal

Irritatin' these bitches like eczema, I can hang anywhere like a testicle

So much winnin', they thinkin' it's rigged, never thought I would do it this big

I'm the youngest bitch ownin' her masters, bitches always fucked, stuck in a deal



Ayy, I'm at the top of my game, I'm who they hate

This shit come with the fame, that's how I knew that I made it

I woke up lookin' this good, I'm in my prime, these niggas gotta get played

If these bitches ain't mad, I need to go harder, I can't let 'em think we the same



I don't wanna be your bestie, these hoes messy, always worried 'bout the next bitch

Always itchin' for a motherfuckin' problem, bitch hoe, please, go get tested

Always beggin' me to crash out with these losers, shut up, enjoy this music

Y'all gon' learn how I move on my time, and not for none of y'all amusement, hm"

And I be checkin' the trap and wreckin' the rap game

It take a second to snap, no reason to cap, mane

I got money to peel so I don't wanna hear about how funny you feel

Just make money, a mill'

See, I don't really care if you shake it or sell it, or

Take it or tell it, just make it or mail it, but

Nigga, the velvet and satin and silk

It don't matter, just let the cat lap at the milk

We gotta do what they don't, gotta say what they can't

Gotta be who they won't and leave they dick in the paint

I got the game and you can't clean it, can't spoil it

Bogarters washed up flushed down the toilet

Never heard of monogamy, shit don't work in a service economy

PA pimp, niggas ridin' a mahogany or burgundy red

Now get that paper together, bitch, you heard what we said, huh



Uh, need to get it together

Lil' bitch need to get that paper together (Hey, hey)

Uh, bitch, get it together (Uh, yeah)

Lil' bitch need to get that paper together (Hey, hey)

But now I sell dope on a record label

I keep my loud one on the track

To break that trick and bring the money back

So we can smoke big and sit on leathers

Say, ""Bitch, you need to get my paper together""

I ain't really got no time

To stand around here while you make up your mind

You need to get out there on the grind

And get that money while you in your prime

You know I gotta keep the bitch lookin' fine

'Cause she pop that pussy on the dime

So we can shine in stormy weather

Whole lot of diamonds with the ice blonde inches

Make a nigga, break a nigga, shake a nigga, take a nigga

Big chain, swing my whip like I hate a nigga

Hide me, won't let a dirty bitch take a picture

You ain't a bad bitch if he cheatin' and you stayin' with him

You want a bitch like me? Get your paper together

It take a second to snap, no reason to cap, mane

I got money to peel so I don't wanna hear about how funny you feel

Just make money, a mill'

See, I don't really care if you shake it or sell it, or

Take it or tell it, just make it or mail it, but

Nigga, the velvet and satin and silk

It don't matter, just let the cat lap at the milk

We gotta do what they don't, gotta say what they can't

Gotta be who they won't and leave they dick in the paint

I got the game and you can't clean it, can't spoil it

Bogarters washed up flushed down the toilet

Never heard of monogamy, shit don't work in a service economy

PA pimp, niggas ridin' a mahogany or burgundy red

Now get that paper together, bitch, you heard what we said, huh



Uh, need to get it together
