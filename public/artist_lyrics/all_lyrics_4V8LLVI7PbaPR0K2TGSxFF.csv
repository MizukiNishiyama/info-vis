Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage, you look lunch my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no mollies, bitch
I'm hockin', spitting got some niggas out here poppin' Ollie switch

Buncha novices, odd future the squad, its thick

Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense

We the last of a dying breed

And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs

You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please

My pocket's solid, making profit off the highest tees

Bitch, twerk as I get on the verse, cursin'

Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person

Watch me get this money, I'm up when the bird's chirpin'

Make actions, fuck rehearsing



Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365

You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time

Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind

You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time

Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind

You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine



In a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather

Sitting on tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather

Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether

Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better

I was a drama club kid, I'd run with a fun dip, my nuts itched

I was defiant, always said, ""fuck shit""

Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one

Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some

See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's

And I be gassin' in my buzz like some bees in a shell

Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele

And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille

I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well

I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself

These fucking rappers got stylists, it's cause they can't think for themselves

See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but

Really, boy posers looking silly boy

I'm in that past season 'preme shit, older than Tity Boi

Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is (diddy riese)

Na'kel smith transworld page 64

Poppin' like oil, ollies, and fire flames

I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game

The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name

I'm 'bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes

But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hate dentists

God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished

And my shit's missing, he hates women, but loves kittens

See y'all niggas trippin' man

Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong

Saying I hate gays even though frank is on 10 of my songs

Look at that mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me

Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat

Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind

But talk is money, I said, ""hi,"" I guess I bought him some time

Look at the ones in the crowd, that shit is barnacles, huh?

They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?

But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan

And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements

And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing

Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for their fucking ratings

""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape

All the Tron Cat fans are getting sick of the lakes

But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints

But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank

Over and over, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?

My fans don't think turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct

Fuck buying studio time I'ma go purchase a shrink

Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch



Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365

You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time

Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind

You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine



Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365

You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time

Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind

You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine



This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering

So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me

But momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (why don't you jump you fucking pussy?)

I'm seeing it's a drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me

That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff

Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (fucking faggot)

Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids

So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)

Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and

All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (pistol, I got one!)

Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs

Bitch gotta (Oh, shut the fuck up!)"

Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage, you look lunch my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no mollies, bitch
I'm hockin', spitting got some niggas out here poppin' Ollie switch

Buncha novices, odd future the squad, its thick

Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense

We the last of a dying breed

And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs

You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please

My pocket's solid, making profit off the highest tees

Bitch, twerk as I get on the verse, cursin'

Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person

Watch me get this money, I'm up when the bird's chirpin'

Make actions, fuck rehearsing



Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365

You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time

Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind

You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

In a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather

Sitting on tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather

Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether

Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better

I was a drama club kid, I'd run with a fun dip, my nuts itched

I was defiant, always said, ""fuck shit""

Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one

Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some

See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's

And I be gassin' in my buzz like some bees in a shell

Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele

And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille

I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well

I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself

These fucking rappers got stylists, it's cause they can't think for themselves

See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but

Really, boy posers looking silly boy

I'm in that past season 'preme shit, older than Tity Boi

Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is (diddy riese)

Na'kel smith transworld page 64

Poppin' like oil, ollies, and fire flames

I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game

The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name

I'm 'bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes

But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hate dentists

God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished

And my shit's missing, he hates women, but loves kittens

See y'all niggas trippin' man

Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong

Saying I hate gays even though frank is on 10 of my songs

Look at that mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me

Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat

Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind

But talk is money, I said, ""hi,"" I guess I bought him some time

Look at the ones in the crowd, that shit is barnacles, huh?

They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?

But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan

And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements

And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing

Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for their fucking ratings

""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape

All the Tron Cat fans are getting sick of the lakes

But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints

But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank

Over and over, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?

My fans don't think turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct

Fuck buying studio time I'ma go purchase a shrink

Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch



Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365

You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time

Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind

You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine



Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering

So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me

But momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (why don't you jump you fucking pussy?)

I'm seeing it's a drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me

That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff

Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (fucking faggot)

Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids

So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)

Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and

All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (pistol, I got one!)

Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs

Bitch gotta (Oh, shut the fuck up!)"

For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you


It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines

When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times

Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line

Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime

In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest

And get high sticking bad hyenas in vagina's

I'm the fliest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit

I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this

I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now

30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down

Another flight, another beat, another city, wow

Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out

Where we at? We on top of the world



And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park

I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back

Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blond Cadillacs

All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact

Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat

Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through

And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black

Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at

Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel

Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt

Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back

We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat

Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's

Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?



Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team

Hell yeah I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green

Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed

Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds

We at Randy's ordering that 306

Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me

Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song

Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur

No longer, but we working, premature, immature

She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt

On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door

Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption

Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion

Where we at? We on top of the world



Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing

Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend

Always been the most cool, they chase our shade

They say life switches pace when you got shit made

So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days

When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane

And too often they think that they could stop me

Now every show we makin' half a Maserati

And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi

Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me

Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey

Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard

I got the world saying every single Friday is black

Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know

Where we at nigga? 

We on top of the world



Where we at, niggas?

Where the fuck we at, man? 

You niggas don't know me, huh

Where we at?



Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh

Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir

You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt

Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert

My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook

Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook

My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either

I ain't signed a fucking deal yet

But when I do Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages

That could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage

Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon

From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill

Shit is getting real, people begin to feel

Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals

About some shit, they bitch and pout

(Can we get backstage man?) No, fagot, it's sold out

(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me

You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty

I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)

But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)

Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty

Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi

Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be

And I be where, anybody cares

I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams and have fun""

(Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some

(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side

Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?

When I'm on that stage I feel important

A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin

Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him

You gotta be fucking kidding me

At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero

And they fear it when they hear it when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics

Yeah rebel nigga cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit

Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building"
