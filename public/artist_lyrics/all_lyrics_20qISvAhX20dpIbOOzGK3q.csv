Cunning as the father of the twelve sons of Jacob
Shake up the world, cake crumbs
Cover my gold teeth, cufflinks, waiters
Lobster sauce on aprons
Pardon, that's the chef

Burgundy on the breath

Uncertainty when I step

Dancin' to every song like it's a contest

Singin' to Stevie Wonder Happy Birthday

Celebratin' years of flows and crazy wordplay

Season, I'm leaving my 40's, I'm a griot

Deep as Deepak Chopra

Dress socks and loafers

Family only, I'm holdin' hands with a cold piece

Bow to the old me, I'm officially OG

Might throw a roast me, wonder what will the jokes be

Watchin' 'em imitate my crude demeanor

It's a new decade, I'm in a whole new arena

Roll the dice in this life and I hit the fever

Get it



Wolf out of NYC

This is prophecy

Know this is meant to be

Evolve constantly

Half a century

Put your glasses up

Represent for me

Represent, represent

Represent for me

Represent, represent

Represent for me

Fly from infancy to half a century

Ah-ha, represent



Cryin' faces for the double agents watchin' my every move

Go tell em I can't sit still, I never do

Let them think of all the places I led them

Go look at it through an all age spectrum

Still winnin', never a better move

Who they claim to be today?

Man, they can never choose

We all got a set of tools we gotta use to push through

Like I did, and Esco is my nom de plume

Party in the penthouse, live

Fill all the rooms with beautiful vibes

That's the way to calm the goons

Champagne flutes, my cigars pop balloons

Bowties get untied when the clock hit 2

A '73 baby

I say a speech maybe

Besides the Littles and Joneses, hip-hop made me

Born in New York, I hope the most high keeps you

I wish at least fifty on all my good people

Fever



Wolf out of NYC

And all they say is this, but they ain't sayin' shit
They talk reckless when I do not work for them

They say ""Come harder, come smarter"", which one it is?

Which one you wanna hear? Since you such a music wiz

First thing I learned when I was comin' up in age

When they stumble in your space, is to punch 'em in the face

The second thing I learned, I was in thе second grade

The third I heard was, if it quacks, it's a duck

The fourth, of course, just be upfront what you want

The fifth was this, keep somethin' crisp on your wrist

It's your time, bro

Yeah, you know what?

Yeah, that and this and that

You know, yeah



Don't be scared to execute the vision, lock in

Get back to the art, not the trends, tsk

I mainly invented raps by bangin' on table tops

And takin' on any competition

Listen, they put hammers to your ribs, but I'm too legit to quit

They like Bishop with a blick, they exposin' who a bitch

And I'm like Furious when he took his son to fish

Droppin' knowledge on the kids, droptop when we slid

Step on lawns, trip on, Dior slide, grip on the handrails

Crib on some acres, pull off the tails off shrimps

Some beyond blond, sip on some fine wine, we just some shakers

So when Planet Rock came out the Bronx, I was watchin' boomboxes

T La Rock never made it rich?

And when I witnessed that the benefits of livin' good from makin' hits

I make bread off what I invent

You shouting, announcing, you wanna win

With similar minded men with great business acumen

We can make an acquisition till the topic turn from tight pockets to high profits

To life insurance, at what age do we all cop it?

Fuck who the hottest

Who really stand up?

Who really messing with they dead man girl?

Hot like on a detective list

Cold part, Illmatic all through that episode of Ozark

I think that's harder than if I had co-starred

A ghetto symphony, I'm Chief Keef Cozart, mixed with Mozart

It's I'll when you get bags for your own art

Million dollar synch for Al Jarreau of Rap

But they ain't understand it when it dropped, yo, how cold is that?

They asking if I'm ever gon' be over rap

But I left a few times, just never told you that

Shhh

Dear older me

You grown to be

The one to coach the team, uh

You still be on your fly shit

Part spiritually psychic

You walk through the Hayes like Isaac

And maybe this gen will see what you and Hit done

If they don't call it how it is, that's a big dub, uh

That big age rap

You did your big one

My favorite ever from you gotta be this one



Got through the scars, every one

Cops drew down on you with guns

Close friends, you lost some

No tears on your face, none

You missed time seeing your son

It's hard to find genuine love

Family members in them cuffs

No tears on your face, none

Everything is just what you made it out to be

The world of entertainment got some lessons from your pops

Held it down alone, Moms on heavenly watch

The tears on my face just stop



Uh

Dear older me

You became everything you chose to be, huh

Took the wheel and you drove the speed

Out on the road, it took you higher than coca leaves, huh

You at the age you say what it is

You call every girl in your phone like, ""Come to the crib""

Ain't gotta hide nothin', what you gotta lie for?

One come through the front, one leavin' out the side door, potential

But what's potential if all amiss in the mental?

And what you been through could mess up now what you into

Got the essentials to murder an instrumental

Made it to Gen Z, deservin' what they extend to you

Talkin' to the younger you

Every stage problems'll still run to you

That big age rap

You did your big one

My favorite ever from you, I can't even pick one



Got through the scars, every one

Cops drew down on you with guns

Close friends, you lost some

No tears on your face, none

You missed time seeing your son

It's hard to find genuine love

Family members in them cuffs

No tears on your face, none

Everything is just what you made it out to be

The world of entertainment got some lessons from your pops

Held it down alone, Moms on heavenly watch

The tears on my face just stop



Talkin' to my younger self

They say in the big 50's

That's when you get rich, rich, rich, rich

In every aspect

You got nothin' to worry about

We ain't gon'—



We ain't gon never die, icons in real time

Why did I wait this long to let y'all in my ill mind?

I think the hate was strong, so I went to a chill vibe

Could never say goodbye, I let my skill cry

Let my soul bleed, inside the Rolls, red rosaries

Homie, I lovе the new NY, 'cause I'm thе new NY

And the old NY at the same time

I always hit the last shot when it's game time

The Jordan, Kobe, 'Bron talk, take a long walk

You might start to understand what I'm puttin' on for

I left more flows in Pro Tools sessions

Than you ever thought of with old school methods

But what you're hearin' is the present day

Over breaks and samples of New York, NWA

The brand new Brand Nubians, N-A-S and Wayne

Don't threaten me with a good time, we're here to stay

Nasty, they don't make 'em like me

Mask up, all black like I'm Pooh Shiesty, shoot through

I'm like Detroit Red in the zoot suit, loose screws

Any great challenges I find a loop through

Loopholes, why they treat me so bad, Club Nouveau, damn

The times we livin' in crucial

This my Tom Cruise flow, top gun, they too slow

Computers ain't fast enough to keep up with Nasty 'cause

Uh, icons, steppin' on pythons

Spittin' that cayenne, eat ya like Zion, peakin' at the skyline

Reachin' for the stars like I'm reachin' for the pylon

I seent ya on the sideline, we need to walk a fine line

We need to read the guidelines, instead of readin' the timelines

Why everybody like wine? Nobody flow like mine

I'm sonnin' these niggas, got me coachin' niggas like Prime

Tongue, I never bite mine, got dough like Taekwon'

To spend all this money, I'ma have to spend a lifetime

You broke, can’t even buy time, should throw niggas a lifeline

Know money on my mind, and I be on your wife mind

And hit her with the pipe bomb, and pass it down the pipeline

But actually we're quite fine

Diamonds on me sparklin' and splashin' like some white wine

They love me in the night time, they hate me when the light shine

Shots, I got a hundred, and problems, I got ninety-nine

Bugatti Veyron, take off with no flight time

Bad bitch on the passenger side, she don't even like flyin'

Booty soft as nylon, you niggas small as micron

I got a black nina that get nasty as a white blonde

Low credit, high crime, open mind tight rhymes

When they hear my lines, these rappers gotta catch up like Heinz

Weezy and my slime Nas, ain't nobody like us

Weight 135, she like 5'5

I see them thighs on her

Make me want to multiply

She's a queen, her dad a G, I know he rocked to Nas



And I, uh

She was so fly

Like she come from Queens or maybe L.I.

I tried to find that woman

No later than tomorrow

Her body shaped like a Jean Gaultier perfume bottle

When I find her, I'ma roll through

Smooth in the Ghost coupe

Make shorty hop in, listen to BIG's vocals

See if I get a sign of intellectual

See if she rude, if she wild, if she sexual

If we caught a vibe, that'd be incredible

We probably break box springs, near hot springs like we on edibles

I would fit her in my schedule

If she is for real solid, nothing else is acceptable

Slide up to Malibu, paddleboats in Pacific Coast

Having her swim in Atlantic water, it's less cold

I make her listen to poetry, hit a jazz club

Asked her would she'd leave if I was down to my last dub

I gotta find that girl

What block she be on?

Heard she was last seen in Rome

Plane-hopping in Florence



I think she right for me and I don't even know her

I mean the one time I seen her she was naturally glowing

That's why I made this song, told the label promote it

So she can hear it

'Cause even if she don't like rap

This still gon' find her right where she's at

And dude is cool but he live how fools live when tools spit
He's in the middle of it, little nigga shit

And I bet my chick be sharin' our news

Tellin' his girl when I told her about my power moves

You know? Showin' off

Showed her the Chloe I bought her, they both with floss

Her friend shinin', fresher, she got broke off with more diamonds

They go to islands then they post pictures

I search her friend namе, her page come up

Shе with a dude I said, ""I know this nigga""

Then I showed ol' girl, ""Do you know this nigga?""

""Look closer, for real, you ever met this guy?""

I told her, ""Zoom in tighter"", she said, ""We met one time""

Private investigator shit

Yeah

Me and dude alright

Seen him on the scene a few nights

Little chain and bracelets, nothin' crazy somethin' light

Introduce himself to me, tough act

But he's a goofy, he hype

Impressin' ladies with his vest on tight

Like he a target, a marked man or perhaps hard to kill

But you attract what you fear and you ask for, for real

My girl says, ""Why you ask about him?

Back to the problem

Can't tell her it's an unsolved murder, never mind it

""Forever find it strange"", she says

First you excited, then you silent, somethin' has changed?

She says, ""I said I knew a guy and he had a beautiful mind

And who would have knew he would die, they ruled it a suicide""

But that guy in the picture, sometime will ride with my nigga

Rest in peace, Half A Mill, a god amongst niggas

Was it self-inflicted? Somebody came to get you?

Maybe I'm paranoid

Somethin' sabotagin' the path he was on

But you passed on

You left us your scriptures, I'm in the whip, playin' your songs

Then I saw your face, still remember when I brought you to L.A

And we performed on Keenan Ivy Wayne (Yeah)

And your light remains, rest up to TJ

That's Havoc’s brother killer black, went a similar way

I used to call down to the crib, you would answer the phone

And years later you went shootouts with some of my mans with the chrome

Wow, so foul

How do projects turn to a war zone? This is the place we call home

Drama homicide, suicide in our father's eyes

We programmed to survive but it's love that we don't prioritize

Speakin' of love, it was me and her

It was up between me and shorty, we crushed

I felt she was sent from above

That kind of karma with her, it's finally gone

I don't call her no more, we ain't talkin' no more (We ain't talkin')"

Fresh cut, lined up, his hair clean, it's not a fair game

Can't trust how they move, and his solitaire chain

His bust down Cuban whippin' the 'Rari truck

Cuts down the music, he got a call that was confusin'

Heard this kid said in front of that dude somethin' that never happened

Somethin' bein' perceived like it's beef, but it's street gossip

It's nothin', ain't 'bout no cash and hung up the phone

He can tell by the sound of his tone

Next time we see him, it might have to be on

Four Seasons with the heaters

He pull in the valet, he playin' Jackson 5, Maria

Pourin' good burgundy, drinkin' wine by the liter

Million dollar ideas, son a thinker, but he's surrounded by negative peers, minds of seventh graders

Several haters, several losses, had to get his weight up

""Happy belated gorgeous"", he sent the text to his ex

Her tattooed chest where her necklace rest, she covered his name

Thinkin' to himself no other girl could love him the same

She replied, ""We still celebratin', come out to Spain""

He jumped right on the plane

He had bright orange leather luggage when he arrived

At the world's oldest restaurant since 1725, Madrid was live

Lookin' in this woman's eyes

Lookin' where his name used to be now covered with butterflies had a few Spanish connects from touchin' pies

Just to summarize, he knew a couple guys who had a couple ties

To make that shipment touchdown safe

Secured the situation, told shorty, ""I'm out, bae""



End of Chapter one

Chapter two



Nigga plottin' on the plane, crunchin' the numbers

Thinkin' how this move gonna help him fuck up the summer

Told his dog who to meet and what he pickin' up from him

Dog said, ""We solid, I got you, nigga, we bubblin'""

Since Jamella out in Queens used to have him living lovely

She sat down it didn't sing, she got out, he had her comfy

Thinkin' 'bout coppin' that fly estate with five acres

Three hours from JFK, watching Knicks versus Lakers

When the game was over, he dozed off

When he landed, his man wouldn't answer his phone calls

Did he take it or is he locked behind a stone wall?

Did the Feds wait in undercover patrol cars?

Tried to tell himself not to panic, don't go so far

But what's the law of averages when you done broke laws?

He had to do the math on this, he can't take no loss

Keepin' his poise

At the end of the day, he know that he can trust in his boy



Chapter three



Baggage claim, hurry the fuck up

Askin' TSA, ""Is that conveyor belt stuck or what? What's the delay?""

Satan's work, hopin' the devil don't fuck up his day

He had to factor in the facts when it came to the play

He remembered his face last time he was loadin' the safe

Heard him say, ""You ain't the only rich nigga who in this place""

Fuck tryna relax

He had to pull up everywhere that this nigga be at

Said, ""It ain't like my nigga, know he ain't dip with the stash""

Hold on, I'm almost at the climax

Shots ring out, soundin' like some loud hi-hats

His dog got popped at the place of the transaction

Dudes from Spain set him up, straight flattened

On Flatbush Avenue, a restaurant in the back room

They took the money and drugs and shot him in his half moon

Doin' my homework on IG

Shoutout to rappers who inspired me in my beginnings

Who I inspired right back when they pen was dwindlin'

Sittin' with my thoughts, thinkin' what it cost

For peace of mind, I'd go crazy if I couldn't rhyme

I finally took time to drop constant releases

I finally put me first, the intro on the sequence

Don't need a new assistant, I'm just too persistent

Officially efficient, I see it through to the finish

So complete, I'm not a control freak

Personal chef flow, I make sure that we all eat



To OGs and young bosses

We bounce back when we take losses

I pray we all get prayed for

I pray we all can make more

I won't deny it
Two girls, same in the city, both wanna stay with me
I bought the plane ticket, say my life ain't litty

Two-story high ceilings, two-door, blue Bentley (Two)



Zero bonds, so, the women gon' be deep tonight

I proudly spend a hundred fifty Gs, it's light

She ain't walkin' on water like Jesus Christ

Shit I do to gators, Nikes, or Adidas stripes

It's been a good day, but tonight, we goin' back

Whole squad causing terror shoutout Joey Crack

It's a different lifestyle, how long can you last?

She wanna come with me, it depend on how she act

I'm different, we don't bank at the same bank

Shawty know she good when she with me, it's a safe place

For real, I can only send a lo' if you won't tell

I can alley-oop your whole career, 'cause I'm known well

When she land, she let the whole city know

Then hit the room and send me a twerk video

She be all on the gritty flow, met her headed to Coachella in Indigo

Other one had a BMP, she fifty, though

In my business, they wanna stick they nose

Think I'm wylin' like Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo

I'm a gentleman, open the car door, holdin' hands

They both hit my line, I might crush 'em like soda cans



Two girls, same in the city, both wanna stay with me

I bought the plane ticket, say my life ain't litty

Two-story high ceilings, two-door, blue Bentley (Two)



She ready, she sendin’ nakeds through the text

Is your ex territorial? 'Cause, yo, I’ll call her next

Put her down in LES

Two-tone Maybach, it's a 580 S

Two girls, same in the city, both wanna stay with me

I bought the plane ticket, say my life ain't litty

Don't say it was all of my fault just 'cause your girl left you

She be comparin' us both, she know I'm more special

And, she tryna show me the text thread

Sayin' you lookin' desperate, I made the exit

My favorite found a shirt from my new one inside the bedspread

Asked me who it was, I said, ""It was a girl I just met""

I can't be a lover

I leave their head fucked up like none other

Coi Leray says, ""Girls is players too""

That's why I do 'em how I do 'em, then I'm makin' 'em move

I guess, soon, I'll be jumpin' the broom

Until then, keep 'em comin' in twos

I be right here when the datin' climate improves

These days, some girls be slimey as you (Two)

I bounced on her, not yet

But while summer, I bet

I get my next child from her

Have a baby by me playin' as loud as I wanna

My checks, they pile, runneth over

Older guys be mad like I stole their lives

Some of these young boys tight like I had their wives

Realize that's not real, it's only in your mind

The real recognize real type of time

Real man ain't supposed to be in his feelings, that's a crime

Half the time I pay attention to all these rappers lyin'

Real man, they're supposed to be postin' up all the time

I take somethin' you slept on and make it mine

I hit the party scene, they thought I was DeVante Swing

My introduction to that name, they thought I was a Jodeci member

Now when I stroll through the center, I'm lookin' more like the owner

Opposed to a beginner, she need to try the winner

Vibes only, uh



Try me like new shoes, try me like new clothes

A color you never wore

Try me like vegan food, I'll show you what we can do

So you ain't sad no more, a love you ain't had before

Try me, try me, try me

I'll show you, show you, show you



Keep twenties on you, not hundreds, you spend less

And balanced like a one-wheel unicyclist uphill

Inclining up the Eiffel and shit

One lady told me cut my hair, one lady likin' my twists

One shawty said that I should put her on a cypher to hit

Any time I feel, instead I said, she can sell natural diet pills

With an acquired skill, she might hit a lick

Put a fine girl in the studio, you might get a hit

They just like us, snipers, who the slickest, quickest

It's a cycle, try us, it's the beginnin'

Witness the good dude who wouldn't try enough

Gang could've had it all

Denim and leather, no bike club but tatted arms

Try me like stayin' off your phone with some real shit goin' on

Try me like some threads in the fittin' room

Try me like puttin' new art on the wall in the living room

Saturday morning vacuum tryin' out a new rap tune

Vibes only, uh



Try me like new shoes, try me like new clothes

A color you never wore

My mom told me, ""Clean the room

Never shop with savings, son""

Great to have it now but when it triples, shop to death

I had a key around my neck, on a string

A curfew yes, a time to be back at my rest

And my peers, I will protect

There was pee all on the steps

Slipped when our sneakers got wet

Scared to grab that TEC but I had to get my respect, I was

Wow

Was lost for words

My guess is someone'll replace your soul

AI, is only here to replicate and control

Imitatin' the original then grabbed them a mold

Of the binary code, it's your patterns they stole

This my tactical flow, the one they can't redesign

You can redo the voice but you can never read my mind, I'm

Was lost for words

These times got me lost for words, that says a lot for a wordsmith

From the free cheese line to Prezi wine since my first shit

My old Earth left and she was here since my first steps

Therefore, my first words, I asked her where was my work desk

To put rulers to paper, draw measurement, use them later

Punch numbers in calculators, I'm happy to say I made it, I'm

Lost for words, I'm speechless

I'm lost for words at the state of my nation's consciousness

Either you woke or nationalist, it's the politics

I'm lost for words for black babies with low confidence

You could do it too if I win says the optimist

You ever see a wordless book? That does not exist

Say no more, I move letters like Don Cornelius

Rest in peace

Who I'm sure you looked up to over the years

But right now a lot of new rappers and older rappers lookin' up to you

How do you feel to be like, uh, uh, a livin' prodigy?

I think I caught the holy spirit, I put my soul in lyrics

Closed casket and we know who did it

E-S-C-O, I'm in the pole position

Yo, she chose this pimpin', put the pain inside the music 'cause I know they listenin'

'Member I sat on Kool G Rap couch

Drank Ol E 'til we coulda blacked out

He pulled the track out

Thinking 'bout what to rap 'bout

Snappin' like Chrisean and Blueface

Tradin' bars with the Gods 'til they get the screwface

Ouch, I know that's painful like playin' hoops and sprang your ankles

Or gettin' robbed for your Jesus, your girl ain't stay true

That shit will hurt you like a K do

Being crossed by your homie, wow he ain't the same dude

I'm bent off good wine, like Bokeem Woodbine

Home reading a script, lightin' up from a good line

Not no cocaine, this that crack though

She asked for my passcode, she got what she asked for (Ouch)



I know some goofies that wanna scalp me (Ouch)

Wipe out my accounts, leave me needin' mouth-to-mouth

But that just aroused my style

Then I party like I'm Tony in a South Beach house

Bars hittin' like I'm still livin' couch-to-couch

Motivation for the trappers livin' ounce-to-ounce

This is rockstar status, Neil Young with a bounce

I know that make you uncomfortable and make you say, ""Ouch""



Ouch, my view is they only do it for views

Knife in my back and I wear the wounds (Ouch)

Like razor blades and lemon juice (Ouch)

I know it's hurting 'em how I move



You a sniper, she a sniper (Ouch)

That's a painful situation

Ouch, you know when they say jokes but it be real

Ouch, you might take it like they hatin’

Pain pills can't even help you

Don't even matter if you're sedated

And you be swearin' you that boy

Then why shorty got you waitin'?

Ouch (Ouch), ouch (Ouch), ouch (Ouch)

Yeah, yeah, ouch

Shit it feel good it feel good

Shit feel good, bruh

Feel good, it's that good type of pain"

Fuck the chat, you know that I'm 'bout my mathematics

When you run up mad numbers, yeah, that's when they get the maddest

Acrobatics with the alphabets, I gave out Pateks

And I gave out Rollies and new Ranges to the baddest

Plus I wear the scars from the streets, ducking the mark of the beast

Yeah
The feelin' of the first time seein' your name on a flyer
It just was yesterday, picture that on the day you retire
And they still shocked and amazed, I made it up higher

'Cause I came up with them hot heads that played with the fire



Product of the '80s, Prada Milan store for the lady

I'm a carnivore, constantly come with concepts to pay me

I'm responsible for they most cockiest behavior

My DNA in they G'd up ways, and they surveyin' us

Showed 'em my scrotum is goldеn

Rap game stomach was swollen

I left thеse bastards on your doorsteps, behold 'em

Ideas come and go away but I already thought 'em

So years later, they still knew when I go record 'em

I done hooked up with a beast, never stingy with the beats

Experimental, accident records wind up killin' the streets

Black and Proud shirts, white Jesus pieces on cuban link

Civil war chick, yo, she black and white on Egyptian sheets



And I can see the jealousy, I think they really scared of me

Do what I do and let it be (Uh)

And that's the way I always been since I was seventeen

I finally see what this all really means



Did a double album when rap double albums was startin'

They bootlegged I Am, an album I put my heart in

Nipsey met me to do a doc about it 'fore he departed

He talked to Stoute about it too 'cause he was 'part of that project, yeah

Back then, we charted with the CD's and tapes

And I still come out the field, you either scrape or get scraped

You either in and out, you rollin' or you just in the way

What this all really means, I had to reload the Drac'

Eighty years old, I'm stil gon' have a chain, a kilo it weigh

Speedos on the beach, my belly out when I land in Capri

Wearin' black owned designer (Uh)

Math on my mind (Okay)

It's a while 'fore I get there, almost passed forty-nine

I be on the block easy with a glass full of wine

Red Chrome Heart lenses to see I'm in my third prime

The Q-U double E-N-S

Y'all gon' need some EMS when we drop this, and that's a bet



The feelin' of the first time seein' your name on a flyer

It just was yesterday, picture that on the day you retire

I finally see what this all really means



It's everything, from the hard times

(I finally know what this all really means)

The bad times (Anthony Saleh, we got a team)

Like a junkie need heroin, you know what I'm saying
And I'm a junkie, and that's my fix, money
You know what I'm saying?
I need it every day

Nas like the Nazca Lines, can only be seen from up high

Only the true understand me but I see 'em as family

I saw the shit when I was fourteen, I counted on it

I was born a don with a powerful poignant style they wanted

Never dissing for clout, y'all know what this about

Niggas tryna deflect from the fact people sort of fizzle out

The people saw them try to make hit songs that went wrong

This about the money, right? 'Cause all that shit done been gone

Let's throw a nickel at the wishing well rappers

Watch it sink to the bottom, and I wish 'em all happiness

I'm in the cut, attention needers need to front, see 'em front

The world watching 'em shine, that's all they want

And I always get my cut, imagine that making you mad

I'm just a real version, they don't make 'em like that

Never had to get the youth to relate for the bag

And since they smarter than us, they know Nas was once they age

Made they pay grade, the youngster phase

Same mistakes though times have changed

Trying not to touch the cage but touch interior

In the front is the trunk, that's the custom carrier

Let's play a game, I hand you a king of diamonds

The hand is faster than the eye, check in your pocket

I snap my fingers, I'm up in smoke like The Chronic

Disappear and reappear right in front of your optics



Let's slow it down

Was I moving too fast for you?

Let's slow it down then

If you gotta slow it down, I won't laugh at you

Let's slow it down, slow it down

Might be moving too fast for you

Was I moving too fast for them?

Slow it down, let's slow it down



Upon closer inspection

They really are non-threatening, I bomb first then I stretch 'em

Instigators causing these problems, that's why I question

Everything and everybody that's aiming in this direction

That's why I sound like I been spending time in the spa

Thinking about the days I first heard I Became a Star

Words from my A&R, I'm noticing that they notice me

Gun and a mean mug and was slow to speak

Now I hold meetings over cold sake and kobe beef

Hockey jersey, a hoodie underneath

Set up the trust, support the trustee

Corporations is the modern day custies

My flow is the hard substance, mastered it, Bernie Grundman

The stove top and oven, my company going public

I see the puppets they moving like they the judges

But Nas and all his subjects is hard for you to catch up with



Let's slow it down

Was I moving too fast for you?

Let's slow it down then

If you gotta slow it down, I won't laugh at you

Let's slow it down, slow it down

Might be moving too fast for you

Was I moving too fast for them?

Slow it down, let's slow it down



I might be moving at lightspeed

I landed icy in Iceland to sightsee

This long mink gon' be pricey

I might perm up my shit like I'm Ice-T

American pimp, I'm on timing

Only thing that I pimp is this rhyming

I made that work for me back since the '90s

That's a daily affirmation to remind me

I might be moving at lightspeed

To do what I'm doing's unlikely

This new urgency perfectly hurting 'em

Send these suckers to emergency nightly

Fuck the jewelry, I rather buy land and invest successfully

I got all type of stocks and bonds, Kehinde Wiley on my wall

And I'ma pass it to my son

And they end up depressed

Hey Hit, that's some nice new pieces you got
Bracelets, trinkets, and necklaces
Yeah, yo
Real shit only, yeah

Super Bowl champs celebrate like me

With Escobar cigars let me say my peace

Money attract money, statewide hustlers

Jewelry sellers exposed by these fake watch busters

And they ain't teach savin' monеy to young niggas

Young warriors I wanna see them all in position

Best to have it on you, hopе you don't go down for possession Mom's puttin' up the house to bail you out when arrested

How did I become number one? I'm one-of-one

Flyin' down the 101, right under the Cali' sun

Junior Mafia out the subs, shorty calling me, ""Son""

If one clique make a million today it probably be us

Probably because my Midas touch for viral stuff

Rappers wanna shoot up the studio they tired of us

We know that controversy sells, so y'all good

When I drop they hear me on every block, hood to hood



Red Hook, Fort Greene, Canarsie

Hood to hood

Far Rock, East New York, QB

Compton, Long Beach, IE

Hood to hood

Southside Chicago, players in the D

Hood to hood



If we all made niggas, then why is we beefin'?

When them Jewish brothers be chillin' Shabbat Friday evening Even in jail I hear the Latins got eachother back

Not us, we jump each other for the phone it comes to blacks

Don't worry about nobody else tryin' to energy match

Sense any cap and that's when I really attack

I'm OJ with the memorabilia had to steal it back

Like the Nas flow we be hearin' on the tracks

Stop that my guy, you are not that my guy

That feeling to be a king, can't top that my guy

King's Disease I'm still poppin' these young things

Got me thinkin' like Amerie, ""It's This One Thing""

Floaties in the pool, got drones over the roof

Just like Drakeo The Ruler, my nigga, we know the truth

I put out dangerous thought

I'm convinced it's a mixture of Paisley Park

Prince with Supreme Team Prince



Big up to Paisley, shout out to 40, Harlem

Hood to hood

Lincoln Houses, Castle Hill, Bronx shit

Soundview

On the West side, in the Jungles, to the 60s

DC got big ol' guns

B'More got big ol' guns

ATL got big ol' guns and big ol' buns and big ol' funds, yeah

Miami got lots of sun, yeah

Dade County got big ol' guns, yeah

Stop messin' around, put the pistols down

Shit feel like I'm Superman sometimes
Or Superfly
I can't choose, yeah

I grew up around weed smoke, just like the Marleys

Heard my Mom whenever she spoke, they havin' parties

This the 70's, of course Donna Summers' voice

Me, I'm in some holey but clean undershorts on the bed tryin' somersaults

And when summer starts, you hear a hundred shots

Steppin' over empty liquor bottles I come across

Scented stickers that smell like what's in the picture

Was just a kid but I stayed away from the sniffers

We knew better, we knew how to see a setup

Just wanted to be some players pull up in a Jetta

From the Census Bureau they put up a killer's mural

It's a different world with thirty shot clips that curl, melon popped

Like John Fitzgerald with his girl in a drop

If he can get hit, then anybody can get got

And you a easy target, see you never know who watchin'

Cold hearted monsters, whole city going bonkers



Ain't nobody recession proof (Recession proof)

Invest in you, that's what it's best to do (Best to do)

Consuming poison, somebody bless the food (Food)

Who you tryna impress? What's there left to prove? (Left to prove)

Yeah (Yeah, yeah)

Can't be out here movin' sloppy

Movie lobby, they shot him out of his two Huaraches

I'm on a yacht, old smash with a newer body

New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me

New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me

New makes, new models



I'm guessin' it's a blessin' I'm not just lucky (Nah)

They say son hate the spotlight when they discuss me

On a filthy night my man was serving a custie

Under my mom's window wanted to murder this dummy

If she caught us down here rakin' this dirty money

It'll be ugly

She flushed it before, now she feel like she can't trust me

'Cause Jung hid his jumb's in the building

And I peeped him, I was low so I stole 'em and sold 'em while he was sleepin'

Re-up, gave it back with interest, we even

Some of these things that we escape, I can't believe it

Knicks game up in the seats, I barely hit the floor

Not tryna sit across from somebody lady I hit before

Top of fourth quarter, I skate, hit the liquor store

Lambo Aventador, Maybach with a minibar

Met a girl from Senegal, told her 'bout Medgar Evers

While combin' through Louis sweaters, we spinnin' and savin' letters, G's and M's



Ain't nobody recession proof (Nah)

Invest in you, that's what it's best to do (Yeah, best to do)

Consuming poison, somebody bless the food (Who?)

Who you tryna impress? What's there left to prove? (Left to prove)

Can't be out here movin' sloppy

Movie lobby they shot him out of his two Huaraches (Wow)

I'm on a yacht, old smash with a newer body (True)

New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me (Stay on the road in something new)

New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me (Wheels just hit the ground like I'm out)

New makes, new models (That fresh smell)

New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me (That brand new interior feel)

The things that shaped me would've murked you



I didn't have to die so that they could call me the great one

Didn't take a couple albums, people said it from day one

From wings with hot sauce to tuna tartare

Driven in RR's

From hiding from robbery victims in back of cop cars

Tatted from my neck to abdomen

Almost gettin' shot was averagin' once every two weeks

Blessed what I had to been

These painful words, hearing these liars puttin' my name in dirt

Aim and I burst, pistol practice until my fingers hurt

I hit my target, uh, I up the margin

What they on?

You know how Nas do, don't get me started

Chic, sleek, and snazzy from a small family

Fine taste and I hate the unsatisfactory

We can gun blast or party, Great Gatsby theme

Bring your first ladies or come with your new nasty thing

I reached every goal that was high on the shelf

When you high as me you get highly critiqued

Hopped on a beat, purposefully sounding like nine-three

None quite like me, so haters can S-M-D

When they bitter like black licorice, my life still sweet

I went for the cash grab

Crack cash was my math class

Fresh white tee, two diamond crosses, look like a hashtag

News is fake, never knew I'd soon relate

To Tom Brady goin' for seven in Tampa Bay

It's that crazy, I ain't never been bothered, that bothered you

You ain't born for this shit, being great is too hard for you

That's a hater problem, they try to say it first what you might say about 'em

Why you stuck in the past? I stay vibin'

Can't just reminisce only, got to live in the moment

Talked my shit at the MOMA with The Weeknd performing, I'm chosen

Got off the big Boeing in Rick Owens

Those things were great man but today what we doin' is next level

And I don't like to reminisce (That was then, this is now)

'Cause what we doin' right now is really lit (It's about right now)

The things that shaped me would've murked you



Trippin' on 'em

Spinnin' corners

Distant times

I reminisce on 'em

Reminisce

And my past ain't the prettiest

There was a time they wasn't feelin' us

Mass Appeal now we really up

I was stuck on the silliness

Was it love that I was really in?

She look like Sheila E

She looked like she could be, ten years older easily

Her name was 'Oh, well,' I don't kiss and tell

But she must'a ran her mouth 'cause every time me and her man cross paths

It's tension in the air he probably doin' the math

Late night she ventin' to me say he doin' her bad

Few niggas bought pussy

Few of 'em bought gifts

Y'all use that as an excuse, you dudes cannot convince me

Or trick me out my spot, y'all want my shit like Sherman Hemsley

Was you earlin' on some gut rot liquor on two-five

Or your big brother put you on like surprise

Hearing my hood described

So vivid you could see it by closing your eyes

Maybe it was the age or the letters I wrote

When jail letters were hope

You read the credits and you saw Large Pro

Or some decrepit club wherе DJ S&S had buzz

I stepped on the stagе with imperfections

I was messing up, or her first time

Inside a Subaru, she just had a feud with her boo

They drivin', he put on Barbeque and I got through to you

A dude who I saw rockin' FUBU outside Papaya's

Told me Halftime was timeless while Armor All'n his tires

I was tryin' to juggle Columbia Records

While dealin' with what the country Colombia jungles had left us

First time you heard of Nas, I prolly was under some pressure

Gun in the dresser while you was baggin' up in the kitchen playin' my records

Your first time was you hittin' the gas

In the whip with some ass, you never hit and she passed

Your real music test to know if she into the ad-libs

Real rap shit, yeah



First time you heard Nas

You probably heard somebody say that I pick bad beats

But I pick bad freaks

Narratives they runnin' with

The classics they comin' with

Ain't fuckin' with what I recorded last week

For new guys, hope this the first time you heard Nas

It's a special moment

A million reasons I wrote it

My shit'll get you re-centered 'cause you can tell where my soul is

The one I'm chosen, like Bryce and Bronny their Pop ball

So they had to do it

My dad did music, I had to pursue it

And spread my wings on the helipad like Troop did

The truth is, a similar thing had happened to me

I listen to Wayne, I listen to G, I listen to Dre, I listen to me

Since when did rap leave me so suspended in air

Since Kendrick entered the atmosphere, '09, I was there

On La Cienega

My nigga from LA said there's a nigga from Black Hippy

I was happy to just witness history

Like the first time I heard Slick Rick

How did you feel? (First time you heard Nas)

First time hearing Biggie

I'm like, ""Who's this kid? Wow"" (First time you heard Nas)

When I heard Pac

That was on that song with, uh, Digital Underground, like (First time you heard Nas)

Yeah, that was crazy

I really hope that this your first time



It's somethin' bout

First time hearing your favorite artist

Or they become to be your favorite artist after like a long time or

Or it's instantaneous like

I know when the first time I heard Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye

Diana Ross, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder

Like, N.W.A., what the fuck is this shit, kid?

I was goin' crazy"

Everything be going good but then y'all pull me in
And mess everything up
Why y'all always let me win?
Uh

I be tryin' to find the best way they can stop me cold

Another body and guess who the cause, and why they foes?

Beef is my name, my story is age old

Some question, why do I always come to take souls?



I'm everywhere in the hearts of men

Jealousy and envy my right hands, them is my mans

I'm what happens on mad blocks, I'm the jabs takin' in talks

The arguments between the women in the crab leg spots

That behind the back shit complex and multifaceted

Lesson to the real, I be decimal subtracting shit

The devil is a lie, I could confuse a genius

Have him movin' real dumb over nothin' at my convenience

When empires fall over women, I am the reason

USA and Al-Qaeda, I'm the tension between 'em

I'm the words that get misinterpreted

I'm the get back, I'm the first to hit

I'm the worst of it, lurkin' on your premises

I am your nemesis

Parents of every slain rapper wish I didn't exist

But I'm alive and I thrive on your ignorance

I'm a thousand foot fence that keep you from getting rich

Get around me



I be tryin' to find the best way they can stop me cold

Another body and guess who the cause, and why they foes?

Beef is my name, my story is age old

Beef is my name, my story is age old

Some question, why do I always come to take souls? (Take souls)



I'm the invasion of personal space

Fake smiles on your face, just serving' 'em hate

All that internet beef, that shit a virgin to me

I been here before the Bible it's murder I speak

The energy creepin' 'round the blocks and the streets

Take his guys with him shoppin', they side-eyeing to please

Everybody's impossible, it don't stop in the P's

I'm eternal, I'm everywhere the action at

I'm always where the guns are blazin', attractin' that

The grimiest places is my natural habitat

In all the jails and all the parties I be

Drive-bys with kids that killed accidentally

That's the type of shit they try to pin to me

Tragic situations give me my identity

And beef cut off the fat, that sizzle in grease

Love to many deceased over me



I be tryin' to find the best way they can stop me cold (Beef)

Another body and guess who the cause, and why they foes?

Beef is my name, my story is age old

Some question, why do I always come to take souls?

I be tryin' to find the best way they can stop me cold

Another body and guess who the cause, and why they foes?

Beef is my name, my story is age old

Some question, why do I always come to take souls? (Take souls)



People got me in some shit everyday

Over this, over that

Over nothing, over something

Either way, it's on



Why it's always gotta be resortin' to me?

I ain't asked for this power, it's torture, it forced me to see

People drainin' themselves, some pull off some horrible deeds

Rumors turnin' into a monster, lies always mislead

By the time you hear what somebody said

It's stretched out, they expanded and made it worse

Now you all stressed out

You wish you got it straightened out

But it's too far gone

From ""Who Shot Ya?"" to ""Hit Em Up"" to Tupac's song"

Am I snitching when the police commissioner my friend?

Am I a player when me and the mayor hang and tap in?

Just a grown man tryna see how to change the community

'Cause all I see if mama's crying, reading eulogies

Thinking 'bout, everything her baby could've grew to be

Speaking unity for years, but face scrutiny

He weird, one day Esco be rapping 'bout shootin' me

Next day he say ""And I can"", he been confusin' me

Don't wet that

I advise you to mind, I don't just rap

Look around every town like a deathtrap

Out his mind, put a nine to his neck tat

And it went plat-plat, now we set back

And I'm scratchin' my head under my Mets cap

With the new Klan but wearin' jet black

I don't know how much I can stress that, where the checks at



Don't shoot gangsters

Don't shoot gangsters

Don't shoot (Give me some)

Don't shoot gangster

You are him, and he is you

Don't kill the messenger (Give me some)



Pop, pop a bottle in my Nautica

Bill Russell jersey, solid and sturdy, Stevie's harmonica

In my head

With a Wilhelmina model tucked

The Benz is red, blue one that's Javi's shit

It's obvious these

Emotional rollercoaster ass niggas, please

And most of these guys are supposed to have male tendencies

I endlessly speak vengeance on MP3's

Percocet addiction that could be your E-N-D

Your mindset is your vaccine for every disease

Illness, affliction, sneeze

The pollen has got in your body's diaphragm

Chest, eye exam

The disease king's get, we see it like a MRI scan

I show you how to move when these dudes be lyin' in coupes flyin' the suits fire the crew full of riders, loophole finders

Don't kill the messenger

Shorty, don't shoot (The messenger)

Look in the mirror

You got a big life ahead of you

You are your own cure for your King's Disease

You gotta look inside to cure that

You got all the answers

Imagine no man shot for the next ten years

No man killed for the next thirty years

Think about how much we will attain

And no I do not really know the police commissioner

But shit, I'll talk to anybody about saving lives"

Just tryna get my weight up

Tryna get all my watches in order

Get my safe up, get great



I'm twenty-one years past the 27 Club

It's like I went back into my past and then I sped it up

Robert Johnson, Winehouse and Morrison found where Heaven was

Heaven on Earth, this shit is magic with no fairy dust

Home of the gully, gangsta, the gruesomе and the scary stuff

I told my brother Jung', ""Fuck 'em, thеy gon' go through Hell with us

They don't have the history in the streets that compare with us""

Hood niggas, they wanna be us, thugs in the St. Regis

Only thing undefeated is time

The second is the internet, number three is this rhyme

Before security, my dawg had to sneak in the nine

God must be on my side

I had to eat and provide, my winning streak is divine

I told dunn, ""Leave the street shit behind

Don't let 'em hype you, a slow run beats cheatin' the grind""

Dawg, I'm tellin' it like it is, you gotta deal with the consequence

When you run in a nigga's crib, nigga, you better be ready to sit



Dope dealers, street hustlers, pop cases

Throw dice, on pavement, cop chases

Big gamblers, skullies, hide faces

Gang wars, hot spots, police raid it

Left 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)

Left 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)



Pick a down on his luck rapper, bet he broke

With the arrogance of a crackhead mad at a weed smoker

Or a pill taker who hate a distilled wine drinker

A killer who use a gun to hate on a knife swinger

Aight, I get it, it's who the littest, we in competition

Y'all did it first'll be the death, I got a proposition

You and your brothers stop plottin' on each other, plot on millions

Educate yourself, find ten different areas of interest

Spread your bets out

Double down on what's working then you double up

Hands on your paper, they sending hate no matter what you touch

Honestly, I'm speechless

Fly to Greece, twenty pointers on the chain, I freaked it

Lawn chair in the hood, sittin' comfortably

I must be insane givin' you bars runnin' companies

I'm done with the redundancies, checking on my history

Making content for Viacom, license music to Tiffany's

I come from



Dope dealers, street hustlers, pop cases

Throw dice, on pavement, cop chases

Big gamblers, scullies, hide faces

Gang wars, hot spots, police raid it

Left 'em speechless (Speechless)

Just like when the judge read the sentence

Threw your life away in minutes

Left 'em speechless (Speechless)

The bounce back the greatest feeling

When they thought that you was finished

Leave 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)

Speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)"

As we slide in the G-ride

I been gettin' criticized, it's keepin' me energized

Create with a business mind, I'm from where killers reside

A wild hood, only knew goons since my childhood

Niggas say anything in they raps 'cause it sound good

Don't even mean what they say, horrible outlook

Y'all ain't really 'bout this, house nigs

Y'all was in the house with it

We don't respect fake jewellery and silly outfits

Window down, blowin' out kush

Velour fashions, world tour jackets

I turned to a hoarder, I don't need more baggage

Everybody lyin' telling stories backwards

Like my song Rewind, in store autographin'

To take it back in time to today, I'm smashin'

Flick out ashes, flip girls on a mattress

We get it crackin' without the attachments

Her and my heart is cold as aspen, both of us laughin'

I put the ""New"" in ""New York"", I'm home

All of the watches stay on the Eastern time zone

Throwin' parties whenever I'm feeling godly

White linen parties for whenever we make a million dollars

""Nas think he too good to pull up on us""

See me at a baby shower with some OGs from Corona

Sippin' liquor, taking photos then I slid with a cougar

Coulda pulled a young love but I took who was cuter

Esco relaxed in the hood, I ain't come with a shooter

They asked what I'm doing, they said I was already proven

Who said I'm too comfortable around on my regular shit?

You know I'm a rare nigga but ghetto as shit



Guess they used to the ego havin' head in the air

Hollywood Gangsta, goons with 'em everywhere

I'm the opposite, smooth, not spreading fear

Silver spoons never fed Nasir

I'm on top and I surprise 'em

And I surprise 'em



I ain't sayin' don't have your goons with you

Uh, yeah, I'm on top, it's not surprising

And when you get a lil' older, you move different

Yeah, I'm on top and I keep rising (Rising)

Uh-huh (Early morning)

I'm on top (To the dawn and, I'm on top)

Yeah (I can't be stopped, why even try?)

Hollywood gangsta (Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta)

I'm the opposite of that, tah!"

Gotta be a special type nigga to deal with my life
Gotta be a special type nigga to feel what I write

Special like my classics

Special like my listeners who have attachments to my old style

Won't let me pass it



I don't see the point with weak sayings like

""All them niggas on top be blocking,"" or never help, man, stop it

It’s hard watching brothers who smart but think they not

I need them to realize what they got is a fresh start

That brother that you claim so powerful

The one you said he has a whole lot of pull

Probably already tried to pull his brothers up

And got betrayed, got snaked, got played

Meanwhile he balance his challenges, hard to keep himself paid

It's so hard for him, even though his talent is God-given

Pardon him, stop putting your faults on him

What he did to you now?

The man in him is bringing the kid in you out

You kid him, he still playin' the victim, you weirdin' me out

That's what my perspective is, maybe 'cause I'm a specialist

Sippin' mixed liquor beverages

Six figure checks are big, but eight figure checks and you rich

The Nas enthusiasts thinkin’ they know what’s best for me

More than I know what's best for me, no rest for me



Gotta be a special type nigga to deal with my life (Yo, yo)

Hit, turn up the sample, we makin' magic

This thing is bigger than I could ever imagine

Duckin' the flashes from the cameras, leave out the back

Jump in a spacecraft, we can’t tell where we at

Chauffeur drivin' like a high-speed chase, truck full of smack

Tallest buildin' in Manhattan, sippin' on Manhattan's

Listen to The Manhattan's, Queens to Brooklyn, oh what a feelin'

I shoulda had Grammy's when Ol' Dirty said ""Wu for the children""

Shoulda did that remix verse on Gimme the Loot for Biggie

Me, Jay, and Frank White is like Cole, Drizzy, and Kenny

One girl for the rest of your life, is that realistic?

Some had told me they like when you call 'em all types of bitches

Ran through a few of them, some gangsta, some Christian

Some with a heart full of hate for me, even with a new nigga

They label me a sinner because I left with they soul

There's really no other feelin' havin' that type of control, nigga



Gotta be special type woman to deal with my life

Gotta be special type woman to feel what I write

Special like my classics

Special like my listeners who have attachments to my old style

Won't let me pass it

Jewels over my white hoodie like Juvie in '9-8

It's movies that I make, Peruvian white flake

It tore the community at a high rate, adversity I faced

I roll my own gas to make sure that it's not laced

Damn, I used to hit the block hopin' they see me

Watchin' Video Music Box, sittin' close to the TV

Can't bury you with your bitch
Born alone, die alone
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, burn the whole place down

No more foul plays, housing mentality, shoot 'em down days

Going out of town with a couple of pound plays

Always the one you call your friend but then his style changed

Hard time for non-violent crimes, that's a outrage

We need a meeting, money and fame is fleeting

You never really know the reason why two people is beefing

Bloody murder, in the '80s, he had suede Louis seats in the 'burban

Did dirty, his sentеnce start turning

Look at life, took advice from thе streets of Vernon

Nothing Nice, John Boy Ice, his death undetermined

Pick an island, anywhere for your happy soul or return it

When I'm gone, I pray my family don't get the cash and burn it

To the floor, black 4's laced up

Galactica glaciers, eighty-eight karats, immaculate paystubs

Them niggas do a crime, I drop a rhyme, it's the same rush

And they been sending shots a nigga way but they ain't struck

Can't fuck with me

I been outside since a buck fifty was the only way to get your face done

Doggystyle CD, turn that ""Murder Was the Case"" up

Thinking when I drop my first shit, I'm leaving they face scrunched

Black from the dark side of Vernon from the dime block

They had it clicking but today, it's the new slimes out

Instagram trickin' the hood, what they crying 'bout?

Petty crimes, bitches and money, that's why they lying 'bout



Niggas ain't telling the truth enough (No, uh-uh, no)

Y'all don't look like the truth to us

Hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah

Niggas ain't telling the truth enough (No, no, nigga)

Y'all don't look like the truth to us

Hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah



Now you got your marching orders

This shit'll make your mouth water like food grill with wood chips

Woolriche, button-up flannel, looking wolfish

My hair wolfing, central bookings, simple lessons

One foot on the curb, one foot in the Lexus, my style is eclectic

Eat you pussies for breakfast, then I offer refreshments

Look all that fly shit y'all harping on

They take a watch from your arm and cops do nothing about it

That's what's going on, many changes, more races

When I was touring the nation with warrants on probation

I was a small kid amazed with the thought

One day I'd be banking, IV from drinking

Papi to Abu Dhabi, probably parley with Saudis

Crank the engine on the '74 Chevy Chevelle

Shawty friend is a snake, I told her her bestie ain't real

You gotta watch that, as the lobster crack, I spray the Baccarat

Your reputation, you can't clean that shit up at no laundromat

Sucker, see somebody has to say it, the boy still ain't graduated

I must say they cap the greatest (Be real)

My team is mature, the bags are secured

Surrounded by addicts addicted to having more



Niggas ain't telling the truth enough (No, uh-uh, no)

Y'all don't look like the truth to us

Hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah

Ded—, ded—, dedicated (Yeah)
When Carlito was dying
He see the shadow of his girl dancing with the baby
Like, ""Fuck it, it's my time"", but if God save me

Maybe I'll erase any vice that could potentially bring harm to me

Before I make a move, I think about it karmically

Everything come back like a boomerang

I'm black as Paul Mooney slang

And all I pray for is health and a sustainable business

And a faithful missus

I see a lot of people try to be who they ain't

We don't want money that fit in the bag, we want the bank

Just to spread it around likе icing on the cake

White tigеr out the cage, Mike Tyson in '88

Dedicated like jack boys on Melrose

Smash and grab, yo, this world became a hellhole

Stay cool is what I tell those (Word) youngins

So they don't end up in jail clothes, come on



I dedicated my life, my life

Dedicated my life, my life (Dedicated)

I dedicated my— (My)

Uh, uh (You know what that is? It's the inspiration)

Dedicated my— (Uh)



Whole damn life

If I wanted to now, I could live an old man life

Confronted with how the hood can use more funding

More budgets for more teachers, financial literacy, more speeches

Chefs come cook for me

Look what it took for me, the streets had its hooks in me

Yeah, people ask me what books to read

Destruction of Black civilization, that's history

Journal of Chris Columbus, that is what interests me

Juneteenth holiday finally came and it pisses me

Off for the fact that we came in chains, you'll be physically in pain

Dedicated like Ricky Walters, Dougie and Dana Dane



I dedicated my life, my life

I dedicated my life, my life (Dedicated)

I dedicated my—, ah

Dedicated my (Dedicated)

I dedicated my life, my life

I dedicated my life, my life

I dedicated my—





Test, test, yeah, you know?

To get to this point

I might have to write a script, a manuscript

Yo, yo



Ghetto manners, is you thuggin' me or asking?

Finessin' me or pressin' me? Well none of that is happenin'

Accessory to murder, not necessarily Manson

I'm just a G in constructs, a Pelle Pel' or a Vanson

Ratty clothes, we haven't spoke in years, pat his coat

Check his waistline, he spyin' on who has the most

Best to leave me alone, I get in my zone

Laughin' with African presidents while over the phone

Shit be feeling like the last days, cash made

Mirrors on the ceiling with a bad babe

Same age but niggas be having mad grays

Million Man March for real niggas, never last place

Blazin' gats like young Haitian Jack

Me and money go together like the 80s and crack

Shorty aura like Kimora rockin' Baby Phat

I'm droppin bars nigga like I'm on stage with Smack

To my niggas who have staples from the navel up

Healed up, had to chill a while, lay in the cut

Shorty tried to WAP me down in the Mercedes truck

Pulled up, cobblestone ground in my palatial hut

Paradis for niggas still doing deals in the street

Original Backwoods, I fill 'em with green

Am I a musician or am I a magician?

No tricks, just real shit straight out the kitchen



Pure magic

No tricks, no tricks

No tricks

Little versions of who? Nigga, there’s no replacement

Besides my kids, boundaries are my greatest creations

I been on fire four generations

It’s Nas 'til I’m gone, give my all, give 'em more

Miles on my Peloton, I been working on my core

Colors of Benetton, pastel rugs on the floor

Meal prep me, Ferrari Testi

She out on the terrace, glass of Petrus with her bestie

Drunk textin' while I’m out here tryin’ to spread the message

You searchin' for qualities that I’m already blessed with

R&B exes, charms on her necklace

Picket signs, Outlawz outside the music hall

Bunch of ghetto superstars really down to lose it all

Let’s take you back to ‘9-6, diamonds and MAC 10’s

Lookin’ through a fresh lens

Everything I know now, wish I knew back then

Like it was only so much time left

Before Makaveli the Don left

Booked a flight, flying out West

We was tryna squash the whole shit in Vegas

No media to eat it up and leak it in the papers

Eric B, Big D and 'Preme was affiliated

Peace to E.D.I., Napoleon, and all the innovators

We had respect before we was ever some entertainers

See Suge, he was a dangerous threat

M.O.B. almost turned half of New York red

Brothers I grew up with threw up they sets

Some even had them Death Row chains hang off their necks

There's a rumor that spread I’d like to address

Pac was never set up by Stretch (Let it rest)

I stepped to him at Bryant Park so we could speak direct

He didn’t disrespect, we planned to reconnect



I flew to Vegas to shoot the Street Dreams video and link with 2Pac

Tried to squash the East Coast/West Coast beef

We didn’t talk, but he was still alive in the hospital

And it rained that day in Vegas

Rest In Power



Chill out, chill out, yo

This is my nigga Nas and we both got one thing in common

We both represent Queens to the fullest, aight?

And I want everybody in here

My thumb struck a lot of lighters, pulled a lot of all-nighters
Banned from some afterhours spots
My crew would choose violence, move in silence

Who knew I'd grew to build an empire?

Streets had me against the ropes, would've thought I was ziplining

Techs on the dresser, money off tech, pushing a Tesla

Rolled up a fresh one, it's one IPO to the next one

Rich from corporate or thuggin', expensive mistakes

It's all a racket, it's the same thing, just the risk that you take

Moving too fast, blues on your ass

The boys came through with the task

Peep through the blinds, you knew it was curtains

Breadwinner take a L, leave the whole family hurting

Seen it a million times, sister washed him out with the verdict



So I'm clean as a whistle, drinking premium liquor

In-between two Argentinian sisters

They counting up for me until their fingers get blisters

What I blew that on? I cannot seem to remember



It's not even bragging

(I like that)

It's okay, it's gon' be okay

Flyest nigga in this rap shit



Yo, as I'm looking at the New York skyline

Reminiscing on night-time, shootouts with my guys

Pouring this white wine

You could Richard Mille your left wrist

Keep in perspective, we on God's time (The world is yours)

What happens when dealers reduce to addicts?

What happens when kings don't see their potential status?

What's your exit plan? Face to face with my omens, I never ran

Stood on stages most never can, pyrotechnics and leather pants

Shifting the culture

Mention me with Mick Jagger and Bono like you're 'posed to

I'm standing next to rookies, somehow they're looking older

The altitude of matter so cold, it'll make your nose run

How you expect to get love if you don't show none?

I should send you little niggas on a store run

How we're moving is no cut

I'm from the era of razor blades and coke dust

People living with no trust, champagne and the soap suds



So I'm clean as a whistle, drinking premium liquor

In-between two Argentinian sisters

They counting up for me until their fingers get blisters

What I blew that on? I cannot seem to remember

The world is yours



Scarface, Tony Montana shit

It's yours, yours, yours

RIP Ecstasy from Whodini

DMX, Biz Markie, D

Shock G, real rap gods, do you know the meaning?

All the rap brothers we lost this year, and last year

Ayo, check it out

Run to the store for me, man

Get me veggie chips, blunts, and a bottle

You got this shit all twisted, man

It's all about rank

You ain't there yet

Think you gon' send me to the store? I own the store, man

I'm just testing you



I got the hood playing golf, wild boss style

Crucifixes over the chrome hearts, you get crossed out

People battered down, Asian hate getting passed around

Tiger happy, both his parents' lives matter now

Marble floors is my common law, we company builders

I inspired those who inspired you to run up millions

Not perfect, persistent, keep it more pure than the purest

I do this for them 'jects and them good-hearted jurors"

We used to all put in and go half on bail money
Fuck makin' it rain, now we makin' it hail money
I never met Muhammed Ali, wish I did
My brother saw him, champ told him nothing is real

Gave me the chills, thought about it, that’s how I feel

We on autopilot, no captain behind the wheel

My whole career, I steered away from features

But I figured it's perfect timing to embrace the leaders

Accepted my position as the master teacher

I make cash deposits before the first

Flashy diamonds that’s waterworks

Sassy models thе curviest

Brothers you knew from thе sandbox'll do you the dirtiest

Government assistance, poverty is big business

Overrun the Senate, both parties got policies built for the wicked

Look you in the jungle, you gotta move like an animal

Prey on the predators, go where anybody that challenge you

Board rooms, courtrooms, it will leave you with war wounds

I ain’t wanna be this cold hearted but I was forced to

Wore my sneakers like Run-DMC did

Important to black culture like Spike Lee is

He Got Game, I wish my mom could see this

See the man that he is, moments you can’t relive



Like takin’ your first swim

Like still bein' a virgin

Taking trainin' wheels off the rims

Movin' in ya first crib or having your first kid

Moments you can't relive

Like your first time buggin’ from somethin’ that Nas said



Yo, I wish I met Sister Souljah, but I didn’t

Woulda told her Coldest Winter Ever was beautifully written

She alive so she’ll hear this

I’m dolo, no co-defendants, I been with the social distance

Archbishop of sharp spittin’ sports car whippin’

Ya actin’ like the real ain’t what’s needed, of course I get it

What’s more authentic?

Hit-Boy in a walking Guinness World Record, New York Menace

I’m O-Dog, Hit is Caine, the endin’ change

Traded my youth some say I became a suit

A representative of Martin’s Dream comin’ true

Every man is a King ‘less he make excuses

Wish that my mishaps wasn’t a nuisance

Sunday to Sunday get praise I’m God made

Where I’m from, one go in the grave, one go in the cage

Moments you can’t relive



Like takin’ your first swim

Like still bein’ a virgin

Taking trainin’ wheels off the rims

Movin’ in ya first crib or having your first kid

Moments you can’t relive

Like your first time buggin’ from somethin’ that Nas said



Third verse and I knew what to write

They say I’m a legacy artist, I blew up the price

Thirty years later, who woulda knew dude would be nice?

I hit the tables and I threw up the dice

Under the lights, outside dining, Al fresco

Silk is the dress code, had to be Esco

Colors of lightbulbs change through voice command

Flew over Antigua, made the choice to land

Set my feet on a private island, house come with a staff

Chef know how to cook with no salt and low fat

Extended stay shorty, she don’t wanna go back

You gotta appreciate the moments bad times don’t last

Like my first fistfight in the ‘Bridge

Hype like the first time I heard Nobody Beats the Biz

Those times bring me to tears, moments you can’t relive, yeah



Like takin’ your first swim (Splash)

Like still bein’ a virgin (Splash)

Taking trainin’ wheels off the rims

Movin’ in ya first crib or having your first kid (It’s a girl)

Moments you can’t relive (Moments you can’t relive, yeah)

Like your first time buggin’ from somethin’ that Nas said

(Uh, when was that? Way back)



Just free livin’ this life

I can’t relive last night

I’m excited for today"

Some place to be nobody
Some place to be
Some place you wouldn't know probably
Yeah, yeah

If Chappelle moved to Ghana to find his peace then I'm rollin

Where the service always roamin', I'm packin' my bags and goin'

It's a challenge in that, it's a balancing act

Visit beautiful places that's more out here than the trap

Houses in Long Island they always found 'em

House in the South a nigga barely got out

Sunny L.A., Remember calls with Dr. Drе

He told me, ""Don't let thе palm trees fool you, nigga, be safe""

Me and my higher self, we often would speak

Somehow we lost the connection, might meet at Joshua Tree

And it's been bothering me

Too many wavy women, gotta log outta IG

Can't be my age DM'ing, no kidding, it's hard to move like a civilian

I write the truth 'cuz I live it, not like you musical niggas

We did it big and they bigots, they'd rather shoot than write tickets

What it feel like to go get it? What it feel like to go missing?



In one city, one country, one state

Some place to be nobody

Some place to be

Some place you wouldn't know problems

Some place to be nobody



My dog bought a plane, said ""Let's go to Paris""

That's where baguettes are from, French bread that's long and narrow

I like the other definition, rectangular carats

The concept of this song is rather esoteric

This girl said in Grenada we should go get married

Broke the meaning down of the Virgin Mary

And you got your own place, my favorite part of the night

When you text me that you made it home safe (I'm home)

I'm contemplatin' at the homebase

How I'm used to breakfast in the ghetto sippin' OJ

That's a picture right there, a moment in time

Before anybody wanted a photo of mine

Before the internet energy and social decline

Destroyed the vibe foolin' us with the headlines

(Keepin' us blind) Vultures eat you alive

(The key to the signs) Wishin' I'd find



One city, one country, one state

Some place to be nobody

Some place to be

Some place you wouldn't know probably

Some place to be nobody (Life)



All my time has been focused on my freedom now

Why would I join 'em when I know that I can beat 'em now?

They put their words on me, and they can eat 'em now

That's probably why they keep on tellin' me I'm needed now

They tried to box me out while takin' what they want from me

I spent too many years living too uncomfortably

Making room for people who didn't like the labor

Or wanted the spoils, greedy, selfish behavior

Now let me give it to you balanced and with clarity

I don't need to turn myself into a parody

I don't- I don't do the shit you do for popularity

They clearly didn't understand when I said I get out apparently

My awareness like Keanu in The Matrix

I'm savin' souls and y'all complainin' 'bout my lateness

Now it's illegal for someone to walk in greatness

They want the same shh, but they don't take risks

Now the world will get to see it's own reflection

And the anointed can pursue their own direction

And if you're wrong and you're too proud to hear correction

Walk into the hole you dug yourself, fuck a projection

See me in my freedom taking all my land back

They sent a lot against me thinking I'd just stand back

I got my legs beneath me, I got my hands back

A lot of people sabotaged, they couldn't stand that

I turned the other cheek, I took blow after blow

There's so much crisis in the world 'cause you reap what you sow

When you keep what you know is meant for someone else

The ditch you dig for them, you must just end up in yourself

I'm in the secret place, I keep a sacred space

They keep showin' their hands, but keep hidin' their face

If I'm a messenger, you block me then you block the message

So aggressive, the world you made is what you're left with

Pride and ego over love and truth is fucking reckless

Y'all niggas got a death wish, the stupid leaves me breathless



Some place to be

Yeah

Ain't duckin' nothin'

Just might have to build my own city where y'all need a real nigga passport to enter

Ms. Hill, we ain't goin' nowhere

They gon' have to deal with us

Make 'em uncomfortable, haha

Yeah"

If only I'd take the time to show how much I care

I wouldn't be lonely



Too many moments

Thoughts in the Cullinan

Too many moments when I thought I’d never love again

Scar like a buck fifty, Birdie in Above the Rim

With you, I kept it on some humble shit

Damn, I guess you haven't noticed how I always been devoted

Even when you disrobin' late nights still get the coldest

Interviews, I been misquoted

But you bein' bad is just a bonus, look how beautiful your soul is

This shit feels like a high school crush (Think we in love)

I used to be her high school crush

She woke up in a fuss and asked me, ""Why did I hide her toothbrush""

If I was honest it'd be too much

Quiet storm on the radio puttin' me in the zone

I got questions in my text, ""When am I comin' home?""

You laid up in my Supreme tee, you love my Tuscan cologne

I be excited to see you like I just didn't leave you

Oo-ee

I be excited to see you like I just didn’t leave you

Oh yeah



No phony love, if only love

Guaranteed trust, just to sum it up

You know what’s up (Know what's up) It's only us (Ooh-wee)

It’s only us (Ooh) it’s only us



She want me very exclusive (Yeah)

Relationships bound to fail when you barely into it

Stupid of me continuously I leave it in ruins

You perfect but I might just be married to music (For real)

Life is not what you harp on or what you go through

She boppin' her shoulders like the darkest one in Total (Go boo)

Women with good energy, the ones I'm close to (Uh)

And I already rolled two waiting for you to roll through (Pull up)

She lookin' at me like you need a queen in your life (Yeah)

You can't be single for life (Word) she tried to read me my rights

I’m hungover from last night, pour me some Pedialyte

We was just doin' so well, how was we in a fight? (Nah)

I just want somebody who real

Late-night, play D'Angelo, How Does It Feel (Facts)

You lookin’ for security I want someone secure

Let’s drop thirty at Louis and have sex in the store

Behind the curtain in the dressing room, you ain’t about that life (Haha)

I be excited to see you like I just didn’t leave you (Word)



No phony love, if only love

Guaranteed trust, just to sum it up

You know what’s up (Know what's up) It's only us (Ooh-wee)

It’s only us (Ooh) it’s only us

No phony love (No phony love) If only love (If only love)

So many move like Judas look at the past, it's proven

It's my duty to speak truth to power

Around your enemies, then they call you before you hear about it

Talk to you like it's still love, keepin’ your vision clouded

Campaignin’ with the haters, dismissin' truth for lies

Don't be discouraged, just go with the plan

And caged make their way up out that maze

Get their mind up out a daze

Don't rap about death, it's power in what you say



Second chapter, and you get what you give

It's power in how you live, I sit and talk with the kids

And tell 'em just how it is, go straight to avoid the bids

Livin' fast can wait, stay down and work on your grades

Speak gospel for the next generation

You can have it all, just don't side with Satan

I seen that take down most of the greatest

Hotel suites, Hollywood stars hangin'

The other side of what you think is fly

Your jewelry could be cursed and so can your ride

Let that soak in your mind, Suburbans and Beamers

Shot up with Ninas, how to stop a young genius

Spiritual like a deep cut from Shirley Caesar

I wonder if it's Jesus when a baby reach up

Sharpenin' up myself 'cause I know they need us

Prayin' this doesn't come to a tragic end (And I pray)



Third chapter

This chapter called ""Women"", y'all been the rib since the beginnin'

A woman's intuition, is what a man is missin'

To understand your wisdom is something I had to learn

Somehow you the most unprotected on planet Earth

Your smile lift me up and your eyes kiss my soul

Your sweetness is honeycomb, such a lovely tone

You hold the power to make a house a home

Because of you, I wanna right my wrongs (Love)

Kiss your mother 'cause we only get one (One)

A grandmother's words to her grandson

Beautiful minds develop in time (Yeah)

Checks every month 'cause you held me for nine

They might see an image of a woman who's flawed

But I see a woman in the image of God

Highest regards, I light a cigar

To man, woman and children, my Bible is ours (Yeah)



Open it up, listen to it in anytime

That Revelations' vibe, get you through it

Ain't none of us perfect, I damn sure ain't

Prayin' this doesn't come to a tragic end

We just gon' hope for the best and do our best

And be our best, no less, yeah

Had to pray to God and thank Him 'cause I made it this far

You freak niggaz played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray

Dipped attache, jumped out the Range, empty out the ashtray

A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay

Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns

Regulate wit my Dunn's, 17 rocks gleam from one ring

Yo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing

There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King

The highlights of livin, Vegas style roll dice in linen

Antera spinnin on Milleniums, twenty G bets I'm winnin them

Threats I'm sendin them, Lex with TV sets the minimum

Ill sex adrenaline

Party with villians, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny

Wet any clique, with the semi-tech who want it

Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock I lace em

Fried broiled with basil, taste em, crack the legs

way out of formation, it's horizontal how I have em

fuckin me in the Benz wagon

Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon

Grab your gun it's on though

Shit is grimy, real niggaz buck in broad daylight

with the broke Mac it won't spray right

Don't give a fuck who they hit, as long as the drama's lit

Yo, overnight thugs, bug cause they ain't promised shit

Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I peeped you frontin, I was in the Jeep

Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin

Across the streat you was wildin

Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine

Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine

I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him

What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time

Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him

So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb

Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son

Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come

Then they came askin me my name, what the fuck

I got stitched up and went through

Left the hospital that same night, what

Got my gat back, time to backtrack

I had to drop so how the fuck I get clapped

Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by

It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one

That clown nigga's through, blazin at his crew daily

The 'Bridge touched me up severely hear me?

So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours

Be lightin L's sippin Coors, on all floors in project halls

Contemplatin war niggaz I was cool with before

We used to score together, Uptown coppin the raw

and best friends become strangers, word up

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square

Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear

Nothin on my mind but the dime sack we blazed

with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave

dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts

Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print

Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty

I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty

For real G, I'ma fullfill my dream

If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream

the first trip without the clique

Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it

Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes

I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes

God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million

without the FBI catchin feelings



Chorus



[Nas]

From fat cat to papi, niggaz see the cat

Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back

Holdin gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back

Livin with moms, gettin it on, flushin crack down the toilet

Two sips from bein alcoholic

Nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein rich but now I'm all for it

My man saw it like Dionne Warwick

A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with

The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 

Up in the hotel, smokin on sessamina

Trina got the fishscale between her

The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her

She got me back livin sweeter, fresh Caesar

Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins

Bitches blow me while hoppin in the drop-top BM

Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this



Chorus



[Nas]

Growin up project-struck, lookin for luck dreamin

Scopin the large niggaz beamin, check what I'm seein

Cars, ghetto stars pushin ill Europeans

G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n

Young, early 80's, throwin rocks at the crazy lady

Worshippin every word them rope rockin niggaz gave me

The street raised me up, givin a fuck

I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was livin it up

I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody

Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty

Ain't that funny? Gettin put on to crack money

With all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry

A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years

Some niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career

But I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt

With Jeeps tinted out, spendin never holdin out

Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggaz just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me right?

Like I'm a f... I'm a gun, shit

It's like I'm a motherfuckin gun

I can't believe this shit...

Word up... (word up)



I seen some cold nights and bloody days

They grab and me bullets spray

They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day

My body is cold steel for real

I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed

Under car seats they sneak me in clubs

Been in the hands of mad thugs

They feed me when they load me with mad slugs

Seventeen precisely, one in my head

They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead

I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns

Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, livin harshly

Beat up and battered, they pull me out

I watch as niggaz scattered, makin me kill

But what I feel it never mattered

When I'm empty I'm quiet, findin myself fiendin to be fired

A broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves

Under beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred

Keep me full up with hollow heads



How you like me now? I go blaow

It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul

I might have took your first child

Scarred your life, crippled your style

I gave you power

I made you buck wild



How you like me now? I go blaow

It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul

I might have took your first child

Scarred your life, crippled your style

I gave you power

I made you buck wild



Always I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip

The barrel is my dick, uncircumcised

Pull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me

Results of what happens to niggaz shock me

I see niggaz bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears

Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years

I've been used in robberies, givin niggaz heart to follow me

Placin peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed

I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade

Met a wrecked-up tech with numbers on his chest that say 

Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero

Had a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place

Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him

Tired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun

But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on

I make myself jam right in my owner's hand



How you like me now? I go blaow

It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul

I might have took your first child

Scarred your life, crippled your style

I gave you power

I made you buck wild



How you like me now? I go blaow

It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul

I might have took your first child

Scarred your life, crippled your style

I gave you power

I made you buck wild



Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised

Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides

Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine

There's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin

Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear

He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career

Yo, I can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf

His eyes bubblin, he said, ""It was on""

I felt his palm troubled him shakin

Somebody stomped him out, his dome was achin

He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waitin

My creation was for blacks to kill blacks

It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin niggaz memories

But this time, it's done intentionally

He walked me outside, saw this cat

Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""

He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong

Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for 'im

He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood

Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge

What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt

A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase

My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast

I didn't know he was hit, it's over with

Heard mad niggaz screamin, niggaz runnin, cops is comin

Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me

Damn!"

It's just the likeness, of Isrealites mist, that made me write this
A slight twist, of lime rhyme, be chasin down your prime time
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan, features the freak shit, my thesis

on how we creep quick, fuckin your wife that ain't so secret

It's mandatory - see that pussy, they hand it to me

I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story

There ain't no drama that my niggaz never handle for me

My gator brand is Maurry, walkin through rough land before me

where the snakes put a smile on they face, hopin and prayin I'm stuck

Scopin they lay in the cut, weighin my luck

Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages

Winkin at some females cops with cocked gauges

Really it's papers I'm addicted to, wasn't for rap then I'll be stickin you

The mag inside the triple goose

Face down on the floors, the routine

Don't want hear nobody blow steam, just cream or it's a smoke screen

Imagine that - that's why I hardly kick the braggin raps

I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant

Watch dem niggas that be close to you

And make sure they do what they supposed to do

Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you

Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

livin reckless, die for my necklace

Crime infected, drivin a Lexus with a death wish

Jettin, checkin my message on the speaker

Boppin to Mona Lisa brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa

CD crankin, doin ninety on the Franklin-D-Roosevelt

No seat belt, drinkin and thinkin

My man caught a bad one son, niggaz is frightened

Secret indictments, adds on to one seekin enlightment

My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow

traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo

My ""Fuck Tommorrow"" motto through the eyes of Pablo

Escobar the desperado - word to Cus D'Amato

Some niggaz watch you (uh) see you when you think on the low

Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow

Three ki's, new V's, went to Anguilla with your hoe

Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat, gettin the dough

Them old timers, advise you to them problems that's ahead

Drama with the Feds, not listenin just bobbin your head

Your Roley shinin, thinkin to yourself nobody's takin mine

At the same time, your hoe is gettin snatched from behind

Put in the van, where's the hundred grand, script in her hand

From all the ice, wouldn't you know -

- you knew these niggaz all your life

What made them mark you victim, you fucked up somehwere down the line

now they had to target your Wisdom

She took em to your place, straight to your safe

You doubted it could happen sick of yappin

Dump in your ride, headed to your side

Puffin ganja get to your crib, can't find her

Just a reminder shit and have your stash house where you crash out

Coulda passed out, your coke was gone, now you assed out

Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

I rock a vest, prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus

in a Lex watchin Kathie Lee and Regis

My actions are one with the seasons

A tec squeezin - executioner, winter time I rock a fur

Mega popular, center of attraction

Climaxin, my bitches they be laughin

They high from sniffin coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson

City lights spark a New York night

Rossi and Martini sippin, Sergio Tachinni flippin mad pies

low price, I blow dice and throw em

Forty-five by my scrotum, manifest the ""Do or Die"" slogan

My niggaz roll in ten M3's

Twenty Gods poppin wheelies on Kawasaki's

Hip-Hop's got me on some ol', sprayin shots like a drumroll

Blankin out and never miscount the shells my gun hold

I don't stunt, I regulate

Henny and Sprite, I seperate, watchin crab niggaz marinate

I'm all about tecs and good jooks and sex

Israelite books, holdin government names from Ness

MC's are crawlin out, every hole in the slum

You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum

I'm spending it to get higher

Earth, Wind, and Fire singing reasons why I'm

up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early

Sunshine on my grill, I spill

Remi on imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves

Latter Day Saints say religious praise

I dolo, challenge any team or solo

You must be buggin out, new to my shit, home on a furlough

Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up

Mafioso, gettin niggaz wigs sprayed up

Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy

I'll one day walk into shots drunk off champange from Sicily

This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma

in a sentence, paragraph's indented

Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye

Openin cigars, let tobacco fly

Condos are tuneproof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof

Shittin like gin and prune juice

Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang em high

Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I

Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation

We livin in, dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives

A lifestyle where bad streets is patternized

Wise men build and destroy

While the real McCoy dopefiend, named Detroit is still dealin boy

Coke suppliers actin biased

Cause rumors say that niggaz wear wires and we liars

But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired

I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's --

-- just the killer in me, slash drug dealer MC

Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler

Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow

Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow

rough holes for cracked out pussies and buttholes

Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those

Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it? 

My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses

instead of the fake medallions

Rich niggaz transport in thousands

Foreign cash exchange amountin to millions

Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings

Trick bitches catching mad feelings

Peelin off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin

When we catch them sex niggaz with the tecs you blessed, word

I chill with, niggaz that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks

My red beam, made a dread scream, and sprayed a Fed team

Corleone be turnin niggaz to fiends

Yukons and ninja black Lexus, 'Mega the pretty boy

with mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it



[Nas]

Yo, my mind is seein through your design like blind fury

I shine jewelry sippin on crushed grapes, we lust papes

and push cakes inside the casket at Just wake

It's sickenin, he just finished biddin upstate

And now the projects, is talkin that somebody gotta die shit

It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique

My man Smoke, know how to expand coke, and Mr. Coffee

Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me

""Life's a Bitch,"" but God-forbid the bitch divorce me

I'll be flooded with ice so hellfire can't scorch me

Cuban cigars meetin Foxy at Demars

Movin cars, your top papi Senor Escobar



[Foxy Brown]

In the black Camaro

Firm deep all my niggaz hail the blackest sparrow

Wallabee's be the apparel

Through the darkest tunnel, I got visions of multimillions

in the biggest bundle, in the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle

He money bags got Moet, Sean Don

Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do

My whole team we shittin hard like Czar

Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega, and Escobar

I keep a fat marquis piece, laced in all the illest snake skin

Armani sweaters Carolina Hebrera

Be The Firm baby, from BK to the 'Bridge

My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is

I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies

Sittin on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uhh!

We stay incogni' like all them thug niggaz in Marcy

The Gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi

Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan

On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Papa Chula spoke

Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke

Raw though, an ounce mixed wit leak that's pure though

Flippin the bigger picture, the bigger nigga with the cheddar

Was mad dripper, he had a fuckin villa in Manilla

We got to flee to Panama, but wait it's half and half

Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip

Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half, get sixteen, double it times three

We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream

Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight

We back to sixteen, now add the other two that 'Mega bringin through

So let's see, if we flip this other key

Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak

Plus a five hundred, cut in half is two-fifty

Now triple that times three, we got three quarters of another ki

The Firm baby, volume one uhh.."

Check the shit

My mindset, son got wet, I'm vexed really

They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly

Why niggaz actin illy word to Will he bout to feel it

I feel it, he shoulda been dealt wit it

Them niggaz sour, they put to much flour in they coke

And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE

While we was gleamin, niggaz was scheamin

Seen the ill Beamers beamin

Triple-beam and doublin cream, had em feenin

to get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa

Sosa, these niggaz hit the God, bring the toaster

Meet me in the 'Bridge I'm bout to go loca

Left my 'rat beggin me to stay and stroke her

He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious

wit two macs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober

I need some Henn' to bend me over

My nigga Hav got a soldier

It's gettin down it's goin down kid (I got this, I got this)

I heard he might not live, I'm holdin back tears

Told these broads, to put it in gear 

with two females that don't smile diggin they style yo

Whattup son, these niggaz done started somethin wild

You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill

Tried to get a name holdin the steel, I paid attention to the females

Maintain bitches when it get real

Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal

He said both hoes'll peel, spray shots and reload

and still handle the wheel, point em out smoke a Phil' then chill

I layed back Escobar status, knowin The Firm got it cornered

We on it, shit we was born wit

Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die

That nigga right there inside the Rover

I knew he'd be right here, I told ya

Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova

Polo pullover, big links and rockin boulders

He's stuntin, after he left my man like that

without a fair chance to fight back, BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK

He never seen us, Sos' gave the mac to Venus

and Vicious, lookin delicious, handle yo' bidness

and step to him, shake yo' ass try to screw him

Do what ya gotta do to get to him

A tight parasuco, with young faces

can turn niggaz Buttafuco, of all ages, they was amused

by the way they walked, way they talked

Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York

if they had to, heard him ask Venus, ""Could I have you?""

He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him, ""Don't grab Boo""

They started chattin, was only bout a minute, flat when

they jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin

We followed them pollyin, he thought the hoes were Somalian

Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn

I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them

We layed low about a hour or so, these bitches movin too slow

We both holdin, what if them wild hoes started foldin? 

Sosa, said say no more, we started rollin

Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin

There the girls go, hurry up we out in

the 940, me Sosa and two shorties

The punk niggaz got murdered in the orgy

Listen.. to reason

Pretty baby baby listen..



[Nas]

A young wild beautiful love child

You like them thug style link rockin, then mink coppin

Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin

The head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine

Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick

You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit

Chanel lookin real, airbrushed nails

Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)

To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me

The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me

Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle 

way too many Willies all in one hand

You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on

Niggaz pull your hair, shake your fat rear

Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there

But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars

Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out

Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas

Niggaz thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave

What up mah, frontin like you naive

Pusherman's whip, callin police when you flip

Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us

But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!



[Chorus: JoJo Hailey]



Diamonds all shinin, lookin all fine

Pretty little face, get a little high

Young girl stugglin, tryin to survive

Mother of the Earth, she made you and I

Just tired of playin the same ol' games

Messin with my mind, emotional thangs

And there goes.. a black girl.. lost



[Nas]

Like Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless

Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest

to who'sever gettin down and trifless

To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless

Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs

More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)

There you go again, startin wars, makin me more yours

Seem to get a kick out of keepin me on all fours

Face glistenin, I'm addicted to you

Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you

Igloos of ice trickin on you, you never listen 

to this nigga spendin Franklins on tennis anklets

Must've had a bad deal in the past though

Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow

Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain

You got a job part-time and school's your night thing

With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now

You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin screwed

Typical day that the black girl sees

Comin home wantin more from a college degree



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Where are you focused, on legit niggaz and where the coke is

Nice and Thug Life niggaz, yo you seem hopeless

Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you

could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin to

more than the world, but not knowin nothin about you

You leavin the crib, takin all your kids out to

drop them off, lettin some nigga knock you off

So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)

Growin up seein it, it should remind you, you bein lied to

Everything that move be inside you

Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you

I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to

They spot you out dancin topless in your drawers

Damn look, there goes a black girl lost



[JoJo Hailey]

You should be ashamed of yourself

The way you carry yourself

The way you hang out all night long

It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like ""Fuck, 

niggaz is buck,"" mega bloodshed, the tapes red

I heard some bird whisper, ""Yo he should have ducked""

I puffed the lilla, just before I hit the scene for rilla

I'm all high it's late I'm looking down at the fella

Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion

His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk

It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder

that the street's designed to stop your life, plot

The beast in time yeah, cell to cell suspect ass nigga you fell

First time locked in crime stop my mind blocks the frail

Bursting blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell

My niggas never snitch why tell

We roll with no regrets, destiny's, fifty's and equities

Queens'll be the death of me

Giving the jealous niggas sickness, the witness

Try to test this, scientist, able and reckless

Slaughter, Nautica'd down, frames look petite

Ten millis, mix designed just for my physique

I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely

My pants hang low while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly

Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese

Rollin two Phillies together make blunts Siamese

I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of

early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards

Trapped us in a cracker psychiatric, it's massive

A Million Man March, alert the masses

Ten glocks, Armani in small print, upon my glasses

Don assassins, armageddon, the wettin'

Never freakin the beast, seven heads, got the righteous threatened

Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'

Comprehend the grammar, Manfrione -- are you the type of nigga

to shoot a leg to get your name known? I flip the brain tome

Niggaz get hit and wrap the plastic

The mic I strike in vain givin the pain of what a Mack is

What you with? Luchi or drama, no sleep means insomnia

No need to check the clock, the streets are timin you

It justifies, Nas Escobar's leavin shit mesmerized

Mega live, like the third world

Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin for Rambo, the cop who got grazed

Back in the days, chasin niggaz through my project maze

That cop he got a death wish

He run behind niggaz until you breathless

Everyday he makin ten arrests, sheeit

My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with

I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it

(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)

Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum

to check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar

Vetacini summer gear, she push the two-seater

I heard she brag about the way he eat her

A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba

She do be lookin weaker, now her teeth are foul

Speakin loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud

Fat ass dissolvin, like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin

Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron

I heard she let Jake investigate from her window 

cause she's a nympho, suckin dick and coughin up info

So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up

I know he vest up, we blazin from the neck up 

(Yo let me knock first) Soon as he open it your glock burst

They had the chains on, son hit the lock first

We busted in the cop jerked

Jungle popped one in his shirt

I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth

We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors

They eyein us (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)

Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now

There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now

Two in the dome, he's laid down, aiyyo the bitch is saved now

She's living in a snitch grave now



Chorus: Nas



Shootouts is similar to Wild West

Broad daylight, face to face without a vest

You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles

Please God to save the life that the Devil sold

See +It Was Written+ but was never told

Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold

Niggaz roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit

tryin to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot

Still on the streets with my peeps so deep

We threw a block party for my man goin up creek

to do his two to four, niggaz show love, from all around the board

Peace Lord, Sony Handi-Cam on record

Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn

We can watch the tape play back and just zone

Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions

We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter

Music was loud and it was crowded

Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted

And Frank tried to stop the bank loss, about what a Roley cost

Guzzled his drink, and staggered off

He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own the hill

Couldn't take losin his cash, and I could feel

somethin in the air yeah, Frank returned with Pierre

A gun slinger, who niggaz hadn't seen in a year

I usually be holdin - 'specially this type of weekend

And everyone except for me had started reachin

They had gats in each others faces, with kids

and grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper

My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggaz jet off

Police blitz quick, waitin for that to set off

Runnin the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots

Startin shit in my hood, I can't have it

Yo High, get the 40-cali stainless, Jake is still out

Let's make it real and still make them niggaz famous

Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave

Hearin Jake retaliatin, and Wiz was up the alley waitin

We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died

Internal bleedin inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five

Runnin up in the spot, mask and duct taped up

Pig tied they motherfuckin wrists to they ankles

Life..... I wonder....
Will it take me under.... I don't know
Verse One: Nas



Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin

Imagine going to court with no trial

Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters

No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters

Days are shorter, nights are colder

Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra

The world's hot my son got not evidently

It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually

Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge

of coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars

Imagine everybody flashin, fashion

Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond vogues

Your people holdin dough, no parole

No rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers

Just some thoughts for the mind

I take a glimpse into time

watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""



Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas



If I ruled the world Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby

Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 

be mine, we'd both shine

If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in

these last days and times



Verse Two: Nas



The way to be, paradise like relaxin black, latino and anglo-saxon

Armani exchange the reins

Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last

Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path

The Villa house is for the crew, how we do

Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches

So many years of depression make me vision

The better livin, type of place to raise kids in

Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul

But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child

Seeing things like I was controlling, click rollin

Trickin six digits on kicks and still holdin

Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage

Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish

Political prisonner set free, stress free 

No work release purple M3's and jet skis 

Feel the wind breeze in West Indies

I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse themes to Willies

It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown

I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa



Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas



If I ruled the world Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby

Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 

be mine, we'd both shine

If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in

these last days and times



And then we'll walk right up to the sun

Hand in hand

We'll walk right up to the sun

We won't land

We'll walk right up to the sun

Hand in hand

We'll walk right up to the sun

We won't land



Verse Three: Nas



You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry

Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory

Runnin from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes

These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state

Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight

Tryin to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe

Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera

Makin moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler

Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich

Still nobody want a nigga havin shit

If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit

I push a Q-45 Infinit

It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies

Strictly living longevity to the destiny

I thought I'd never see but reality struck

Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck???



Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas



If I ruled the world Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, I love em em baby

Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 

be mine, we'd both shine

If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in

these last days and times



If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled

I love em love em baby

Black diamonds and pearls, black dimaonds Could it be, if you could

black diamonds be mine, we'd both shine

If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in

these last days and times



If I ruled the world, if I ruled

if I ruled, I'd free all my sons

black diamonds, I love em love em baby

Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled

If I ruled the world



If I ruled the world

I love em love em baby!!"

*whisper*
Silent, silent
Murder
[Nas]

It's sort of like the conclusion to ""Color Purple""

Niggas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in

Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit

Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick

Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung

Where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue

It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer

the violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia.

The cognac plurger plus the trees,

but whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze,

and got enough gold to rock ice in all hype.

Used to be a general but just lost his stripe

Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers

Astoria walls with cypress, since I got a problem with the law-writers,

I kick some more items just to explore horizons,

the palm lady dreamt of this day so I'ma play,

the crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay



Chorus



They say the arms of Nicki Barnes would be enough to blast,

a lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas

Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz

Fuck what they teach in class I'ma reach the mass

Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics

Livin' practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards

So wear it if the cap fits, fold it up money and mad clips

A stack right under my matress

To smoke a nigga like a Hugh Bros. motion picture

Niggas gettin' open cruise, won't be olding niggas

April fools they laugh the jokes on the benches

Cease outside my nigga spoke on his sentence



Chorus (X4) +

Silent

Silent, silent

Murder



My right handers never play too close to cameras

It's nighttime scanners circle that allow gamblers

Peace-making niggas pep talk

the peace-makin 'niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew.

Time to get this loot countless, 'cuz sun it ain't no youth fountains

Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and Pakistanians is took hostage

Locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up

What's the flavour when your neighbors do jake favours?

Lock them real niggas down and lettin fake players

roam around the project this lyrical logic I dilute,

the weak can object the right composite

We're plottin' all murderous schemes,

it seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of queens

the palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'ma play

the crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay



Chorus (X6)



And Cain killed his brother Abel when God accepted Abel's 

offering and not his.

Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God,

and Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder -

drove him to murder"

Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese

Who am I to disagree?

[Noise and a gun shot]



My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square

Headed for Delaware wit' one change of gear

Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed

wit' the glaze in my eye that we find when we crave

dollars and cents- A fugitive with two attempts

Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print

Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty,

I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up for realty 

For real, G, I'ma fullfill my dream

If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my C.R.E.A.M.

The first trip without the clique

Sent the bitch wit' the quarter brick, this is it

Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes

I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes

F' God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half million

without the FBI catchin' feelin's



Street dreams are made of these

Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's

A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki

Everybody's lookin' for somethin'

From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat

twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back

Holdin' gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back

Livin wit' moms, gettin it on, flushin' crack

down the toilet- Two sips from bein' alcoholic

Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou from bein' rich but now I'm all for it

My man saw it like Dionne Warwick

A wiser team for a wiser dream, we could all score it

The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina

Up in the hotel smokin' on sessamina

Trina got the fishscale between her

The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her

She got me back livin' sweeter, fresh Caesar,

Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins

Bitches blow me while hoppin' in the drop-top B-M.



""Word is bond, son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this.""

(""Uh. What? What? Word?"")

Ill designer fleece, studded marquise,

a letta L on my car keys- Thuggin' hard on Cavarse

'Posters be Franchesco and all these bets

Mobile phones in the armrest, ladies be the bombest

I creep tinted, parked the whip and grabbed the rented

Seems like I'm changin' my location every minute

like a plague is on my head, son- I vision red rum

Warrent squads knockin' at the same time the Feds come

Pandemonium got me puffin' Cambodian

Grand openin's of barber shops and stock

My jew-el rock, tokin' pronto- Livin' like a pablo

Papi like a poncho until the state patrollers pulled us over

found the guns and the good

Had a nigga like 'Nas had to run through the woods'

Sneakin' out the next mornin'- Looked up to God,

guess in all this was a fuckin' warnin'

Took my diamonds in for the pawnin'

Now I'm back on the climbin'

Movin' consigned through rain, sleet, whatever climate

So many ups and downs shiftin', I was twisted minded

'Mazed on top, all the hoes and pussy had me blinded

Big lip bitches, suckin' dick rediculous

GS'es and vest-es, larger rays lookin' sentious

Back on the block buggin', how the fuck I been through this?

Nearly caused my life but now I can't show a cent from it.

Hello, ladies and gentlemen
Hit-Boy
I made the fade famous, the chain famous
QB on my chest match the stainless

Amazing Grace, I'm gracefully aging

Without masonry, I made more paper to play with

No rap in my playlist, sold dimes on my day shift (King)

So, can I breathe? Can I walk? Can I speak? Can I talk?

Can I floss without you wanting me outlined in chalk?

Family gossiping, pocket watching him

Jealousy keeps blossoming, ain't let it box me in (King)

'Cause you are not a king if you can't come out a thing

That you got yourself in, claiming nobody helping

The stupidest part of Africa produced Blacks that started algebra

Proof, facts, imagine if you knew that as a child, bruh

Nostalgia, how I remembеr things

Remember crowns, remember, kings

They want your reign to cease (King)

You a king, you will be next to me, doing your own king shit, most definitely

We're so ""Say less when I speak"", y'all estrogen speak

Respected by kings only, address me as chief

Invested in things only a vet would

Only lames front on kings, that's expected from creeps

You mad at my niggas and any woman with any interest in me

You could've made it (You was good), look at all the time wasted

Now you gotta retract statements, shoulda stuck to the basics

All you had to do was tell the truth, like, fuck all the fake shit

You should want every brother to make it out

But brothers want trophies, they troll for clout

Rap is weird, weird flex, but okay

You ain't as ill as you think, you just okay

You got pressed in the hood, fix your jibs up, I'm on top

Stop fighting it, yo, stop with the over-righteousness

It's so lame, this media circus greedy and worthless

My life got 'em tight, why they wanna see me hurt up? (Why me?)

Real kings everywhere, stand up

It come with the game (King’s Disease)"

I used to be at The Tunnel twenty deep in a huddle
Razors on us that'll make skin bubble, Moet, we guzzle

Chris Lighty let me in a few times with nines

That's on God, wish you woulda walked by

And bumped me hard or just looked at me wrong

My chain on, try to book me, you gone

Goons, Italian leathers, couple bottles of Dom

Took risks, this ain't what you want, there's rules to this

Don't get it misconstrued, my suit gamе is crisp

Silk, linen, chiffon, Dior to Diadora

But I rock custom more, that hustler aura, tap in

Razor cutter, nineties, eighties lover, raised in gutters

Raised above it, they made it up out the hood subject, I made you love it

Crazy, I knew this chick, she had a blue Benz

A Jersey penthouse, she used to pimp girls that would turn rich men out

Her coke habits was so savage

She hear voices and see ghosts on the average

Of her stepdad, he raised her from a carriage

She was twelve when he passed, she's been in hell since that

Her grandma raised her, I met her in Kingston, Jamaica

Where veteran kingpins bought acres, rest in peace Louie Rankin

Come here, come rude bwoy

Uno waan ramp with bomboclaat me

Come, come on!

I murder people fi fun

Murder uno bomboclaat fi fun



Peace signs in the air for son

Put his name on the street sign there where he from

Whenever we hear his bangers, flare up a blunt

And praise God, and pray we all prepared when He come for us

Just opened my new office, West Coast branch

Place my teacup on the saucer, it's Esco, man

Bossed up, nothing feels better than doing deals with my brothers

It's surreal, how I feel, y'all should love us

Life is a test so congratulations to your success

For having patience, you deserve the best

You know how they do niggas, the IRS

People I ain't even met take it out my check

They the biggest gangster, I respect the jooks

We buyin' big boy mansions, they respect the crooks

I talk to my boxing trainer, he's my logic explainer

Conversations through our combination

He told me, ""Stick and move,"" and ""Different rules apply to different women""

Some women's into licking women

Some women's independent, some women want brothers who educated

Some women want Benz's, leather seats that are perforated

Some do malevolent snake shit

Dialogue superb, flyest cars on the curb, word

When I evolved, a higher God emerged reserved

More subtle, come from the stress and the struggle

Young then, obsessed in the bubble about it

Took advantage if a woman allowed it

One of the foulest, some would say I was childish, money-driven

Mischievous, I perceived it as livin', gifts and ribbons

Any kisses on the lips was forbidden, I was on it

She curvy, then shorty was cornered, no worries

For the naughty, it was higher performance, or was it really?

The games that I was playin' was silly

Similar to them days when I was packin' that milly, it could've killed me

Caution never crossin' my mind, she callin' cryin'

Me, I'm more concerned why she ain't fallin' in line, was buggin'

Grew a lot since they said I was stubborn

Guess it's real, even players need lovin'

When you enamored by female companions, there's no standards

Once you hit and it switch the dynamics, that's the damage

Reflectin' on first impressions, what's she expectin'?

Why when men don't follow directions, it's deception?



I was intrigued by fine women, I realized

Some were drop-dead gorgeous living a lie

Oblivious to beauty inside truly defines

Will you walk with me or are you there for the ride?

For better or worse, every blessing and curse

Understand exotic sands come after the dirt

I was dealing since adolescent

Thinking my girl was my possession, I stand corrected

It takes understanding and affection

Time is money, I need growth for my investment

I don't like attention unless it's a woman

With majestic grace like an empress in Essence

Let's just chill, catch vibes in the grill

Celebratin', many of us never made it (Haha)

Whatever brings you down won't elevate you (Uh)

Get a lawyer, read your contract, and eat food

Become Roberta Flack or Lionel

When you catch flack, that mean they got they eye on you

Produce great results, they start to lie on you

Is it love for a Queens dude in Supreme shoes

Or did the street code expire with these dudes?

Especially now, I don't expect you to bow, but stand

Creating jobs, named my venture from after the land

I came from, that's unheard of

A hood that's known for murder now doing mergers

The streets is a lie, don't believe these dudes, jail or death is all you get

They tell you never move, but when they get money, they split

You can't please everybody, and not everybody is you

Don't try to force a square peg in a round circle, that shit'll hurt you

Don't try to fit in either, you're better off with neither

Few veteran speakers get medicine when you need it

Especially when we all need knowledge instead of sneakers

Stop hangin' on to childhood trauma, it defeats us

Our challenge is holding ourselves back, I hope you felt that

My moms cooked food, but some of my niggas was starving

The scissor was sharper, my predictions was on it

No fortune teller, just going off regular signs

Niggas often tell ya they moves

Without a word, just reading they mind

Where metal yell especially over necklaces

Life lessons is karma

Whatever you dish out come back as blessings or to haunt ya

Could miss your kids and hit your grandkids for your dishonor

That's generational curses, they said they want the old Nas back

Play the Clue tapes for old verses

Messin' my homies' lives up, sayin' Nas will rise 'em up

Like they wasn't live enough, many lives I've touched

Looking in the Wall Street Journal for your face

But it's always absent

You know that's him eating foie and ambrosia

Watch on his arm, golden, Latin

Try to get his attention

But he's flinching, guess my grimy clothes threw him off, so I mention

We were neighbors some time ago

He was kinda cold, in this restaurant

Full of his kind and more

He sighed, tried to look surprised, I know

His side of the city where he resides, so

I had to go

I heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes

Hate so-called ""intellectuals""

No balls, he suggests we vote

He stand all proud, speaking to correct his folks

He want to lecture folks

'Cause he professional and he suggest that we don't sell dope

Suggest that we don't sell dope

And I guess it's true, but who the fuck are you?



Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?

Tryna tell me who I am?

Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?

Tryna tell me what I'm not

Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?

Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am



I'm Idi Amin, Marcus Garvey, H. Rap Brown

I'm Muhammad Ali, I'm Reginald Lewis

George Washington Carver, I'm Nas with incredible music

Let's do it, thinking of a master plan

Sipping on disaster, smoking on gangster

Watching niggas argue, killing like a boss do

With my hell up in Harlem, hat in hand

With a girl named Pat, she more than a waitress

To order a drink with

She divorced a banker, and bought the bar

She got an automobile, she gives an order to kill

You get caught and robbed

We could see your walk is off, you could lose your rhythm

When you walk in the gutter for a while

You easily go to soft from hard

Now we all about hustlers, number runners

Hoes and sharks and we all know the code of the block

And you talking some gibberish, anti-nigga shit

'Cause you marched back with Rosa Parks

Brother don't start, go build your Noah's Ark

You could float to the end of the world

And pretend what you not, but I know what you are

While I roll in my car, and I'm spending my knot

While my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot

Matter of fact, you're an easier target

And I respect everything you accomplished

But I hope I never get old and talk that nonsense

So who the fuck are you?



Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?

Tryna tell me who I am?

Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?

Tryna tell me what I'm not

Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?

Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am



She Queen of Nzinga

Winnie Mandela, Ida B. Wells

So why can't you tell? Why can't you tell?"

D is for Dries Van Noten

D cups, tequila and blunts

Weed, women, and liquor

Depending on the day is a different mission

The QB Don went and got his Pete Rock on

Nas keep a fine bitch to roll his weed up on

My niggas in Mount Vernon keep it G'd up for him

Speaking of G, the gat I'm good with it, hit your hood with it

.44s never could miss him, coming to see us

Glad to see you made it home to the hood, nigga

Seen fire flashes, the type of fire that spit out a magnum

And I'm the type who runs to the drama looking for who clapping

Nike boot, what I eat him, he like food

Pulled out the barrel

Four-fifths rip through bone marrow

Make his toes spiral the dirt

While his feet kick up rock, he's a sprinter

Police agenda, lock up niggas for three winters

When I attack I'm faceless like a iron mask

They get away quick, traceless, lying back, liars pass

I breathe deep like Lamaze class

Y'all got plenty checks, CEO, man

I'm only 36 but if it's— point five on the table

I say with all respect my dude

Thank you, we had the best times but I'm about respect, I'm about the talent I possess

Never know, there could just be a time when I'm behind your desk then let you go

Could you imagine Nas the exec?

The artist on the masters controlling your release

Probably they wanna wait 'til I'm deceased to honor me

So my product'll be a big commodity

Not bothered if my son and daughter eat off of me

Cautiously I write this next line honestly 'cause I'm a G, there's no beef

I used to open off making fifty G's

But now I spend that on a diamond to make her neck freeze

My larynx'll serenade the hood

I tell the cops my blood dirty, they say I'm all good

TMZ, they hoping when the marriage end I'ma turn to Larry Flynt

Nas is not the average gent, I'm on my classy shit

Here's one small percent of what y'all in store to get

Like a live band, performing in a sand storm

Blind, but I still hit the right keys

Swift as a life breeze, dripping

In fear of God, scented in Diptyque fragrance

Some nights Creed flavors, I am motivation

I don't talk on the next man, I'm never hating

This daily bread, holy bread

Alphabetical numerals, codes of red

What's more dense, gold or lead?

What's more expensive?

And never buy it, it's all temporary possessions

We don't own nothing on this Earth but our soul and that's the lesson""

One night after school and train hoppin' and snatchin' jewels

I dozed at midnight, woke up a little after two

My hands shook violently

My eyes took red

My hair spun in ways

Bread was the only word I said

I heard voices in the nights calling, the Benz engine roaring

Heard that gin and champagne pourin' and niggas ballin'

I put the .22 on my waist

The face in the moon had a mean look

I transformed to the Queens wolf

This is messed up

What kind of fatal drug am I taking? who laced it?

Previous night, memories who erased it?

Wasn't even wasted

I do recall the nightfall, lunar, the stars around it

Then my man called, said what I did, the goons were talkin' 'bout it

Singin' me praises, said I lit the corners up

It sounded like Vietnam screamin' out ""QBietnam"" the loudest

""Homie them dudes is scared you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing

They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team""

So that explain the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer

Stoli' vodka, club soda with my new chick

In Barnes & Nobles new release section she's confessin'

Now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman

Couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth

Was she looking for fame? yo I hope she got it

Since then I been the object, gossip people tried to target

All women should bid

For keeping real fathers away from their kids

These rappers talkin' real shit I lived

How many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin'

Hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand

Stevie Wonder sent me word that he was in my corner

Blind but still sees the pain of a young performer

Used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us

She married again and I'm wishin' all the best to her

Got me looking for my mother, all I see is suckers

She lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em

Come on I'm livin', I don't need many to pray for me

Her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad

Tell you lames something, spit some game

Planes carry me to Madrid, Spain, so why complain?

When you take blame, then you're respected

You gotta give me credit

Woah

Ain't no other way to do it

The craziest things just happened to me, get me

So now whatever happens next it probably won't affect me

How many people owe the feds, keep it real especially

If you an artist in this music game, the smartest ones get abused for their change

And my life is sex, super stardom, and stupid cash

So unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast

I signed my own checks, swore we paid the IRS

Somebody's stealin', I swear to God

Tsk, for now, I invest

To my incarcerated team who got life

It's not right but you still got your life

Rest in peace to Gil Scott from the kill or be killed blocks

Not from Philly but a nigga done hustled them hilltops

Commercial pop artists get all the accolades

I give a million cash away to be revered like Donny Hathaway

Probably not as half as paid as I should be

But I stay in some cars and stay in some pussy

It's a beautiful life

Beautiful life, beautiful life



Woah

Life is good, I must admit it (Yeah)

Woah (Beautiful life)

Ups and downs, we've all been through it

Woah (Life's still good)

Ain't no other way to do it

Woah (Yeah, yeah)

Life is good, it's good, it's good



A thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff

I can say I never been punked, robbed, or smacked up

Proud to say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up

Or extorted for my pay stubs

Lucky or blessed from what prayer does

'Cause hey, I was riding in caravans with AK's and gloves inside 'em

And if I should spare that man who violated my trust

I gave him a pass

My man called and I value his judgement

I let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over

So if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun

I'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder

'Cause I chilled and let you breathe, yes

Let's go our own ways and let the beef digress

I done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us

My younger brother knows this

Not Jungle, got another brother in PA

Spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day

I gotta say I got some fam across the USA

Cackalack to Kansas but my mans around the way had contacts

They was Spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye

Willie, Bo, blowing haze, Mayo next door

Joe, Martin, Slade, I'm solo these days

It wasn't my fault

I never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in New York

Barely survived

Large, I thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter P's in the booth

How to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth

I could nail it, you knew

I was your brother 'til death

Back when you put me on to NiQuay from Lefrak

You was a dime, we was nobodies

Say what's up to Shameek, send my love to Yadi

I pray we all get old if I never again go gold and sell tickets

We could all still kick it

It's a beautiful life

Beautiful life, beautiful life



Rest in peace to my brother Talik

Gone too soon

God bless your soul brother

He was wild

Some things we just can't explain

Life

It's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back

With your kids at an early age

First steps, first words

I can't see 'em cause you mad

Don't put yourself before the babies

Don't say crazy things to hurt that man

You hurt him enough

The good times outweighed the bad

When it was good, it was great

But because I could see him now through the courts, you mad

Okay that's how it is out here

That's life huh

You see we can't be selfish out here

We gotta live and let love

Let the light in

To the beautiful mothers of my kids

And all the mothers around the world

Night, destiny

Life is good"

Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me

John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me

Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard

This ain't knowledge, this is not intense

For honored men, women too

All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past

Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back

I think they scared of us

I think they scared of us, yeah

To Catholics, Moors and Masons (motherfuckers!)

John Hanson was not the first black pres to make it

Abe Lincoln did not free the enslaved

Progress was made 'cause we forced the proclamation

(Fuck your proclamation!)

SWAT was created to stop the Panthers

Glocks were created for murder enhancement

For hunting men, circumstances

Edgar Hoover was black

Willie Lynch was a myth, Colombians created crack

The government made stacks (welcome to America, niggas!)

Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true

Fox News was started by a black dude, also true (fuck you too!)

Convinced my experiences were meant to be

Helps me navigate as they validate they treachery

Felt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable

""Am I good?"" he ask, thinkin', ""But is he testin' you?""

In my hood, fear does a few things

Make you pussy, make you a snitch

Make irrational moves or even turn you to food

Chin grabber, neck choker, in her mouth spitter

Blouse ripper, ass gripper, that dig you out nigga

I ain't gon' hold you, old head gave me old news

I don't owe you, shoulda heard when I told you

You are an extension of what I've worked hard to build

You believe in your own lies, can't be real

And the odds is that what you love can kill you

Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack

I know the consumer behavior, I target that

You impressed with what they wearin', I started that



It's kinda terrific, the product of Slick Rick

Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich

It started for business, I woulda thought they was playin'

All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin'

A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut

Just a spazz putting wax in the blunt

The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front

We building businesses, you can be mad if you want

It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see

Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me

The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me

So cheers, here's to the Kanye production this eve

You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that

From the birth of a child, the world is foul

Excursions of a certain child

Should learn to take nothin' personal

A parent hates to watch his baby's face

Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great

The child's introduction to suffering and pain

Understands without words

Nothin' is explained or rushed to the brain

Lookin' up at his parents' face

Like, ""I thought you would protect me from this scary place?""

""Why'd you let them inject me?""

""Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?""

Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?

If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me

I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso

Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position

Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'

Said ""Screw that bus!"" – boycotted that bus outta business

The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison

If I changed anything, I mean anything

In Italy, I'm Eduardo Wiccari

But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur

And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure

My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion

It was a haunted by dead rich whites

Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ

Circular driveways, black cars and black ice

My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money

Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny

Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria

What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior

Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky

It was important to a guy who was mob-minded

Future Murcielago driver 'til Lambos got average on me

I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money

Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats

Just to remind me, just to inspire me

To stay focused, it's a real sick society

Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me

I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters

Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper

Made a change; the pants-sagger put plans in action

'Til they claim the Pan-African made it happen

Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound

Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light

Brings awareness to my personal life

After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark

See my doctor more, sweatin' the sauna or the spa

Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio

Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know

New girl every night, two girls was every other night

Sexual addiction, gangster tradition

They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended

Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors

Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak

Bon appetit, no bacon, Brothers is swine

It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine

It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin'

Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin'

Say somethin', you stay frontin'

But these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings

You broke my heart, Fredo

You bring this thing of ours down to a fable

Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table

There's always room at my table

Insecurities is keepin' you disabled

All this money to get, is it less time?

They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine

I learned to stretch time, these are the best times

I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind

With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni

So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full of starve, corner store like Mr. Spare-a-Quarter
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars

Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard

Roll with a shooting squad

How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?

15 I got a gun, 16 I robbed a train

Licked off a shot for fun, what's got inside my brain?

A hustler's job ain't done, 'til he becomes a king

But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the mist of

Dudes who switch up and change

They want to carry me like I'm some kind of lame

I never let them know, I just forgive them though

Either that or the pistol blow



[Verse 2]

I remember early mornings - syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah

Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah

Worth 200 million now, bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums

Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties

I'm pushing 40, she only 21

Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G

Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup

Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut

Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck

Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani

Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized

To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs

And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him

Girls all up on him, I spread them, hit them and dead them

She says, ""it is the greatest loving""

The tales you hear is the truth, on me

Who wasn't the most faithful husband

Reveal my life, you will forgive me

You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me

Only a few will, this how it sounds when you too real

They think it's just music still

Well I am a graphic classic song composer

Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure

Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it

My religion is reefer

Big money in most, an uninhibited freak to sleep with

My visions are realistic, nothing's figurative

I can wish it into existence, God want this nigga to live

Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled

Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead

Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?

The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas

They wait a lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this

Pointin' to they scars like, Right here, baby, really Nas did this

Like a badge of honor, not braggin' I'm just honest

War stories we tell them, nothin's realer than karma

Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey

Rap Jack Demsey, Matt Black Bentley, pimply

Shatterin' your silence, pass around the chalice

Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery

Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with

Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst

I fuck your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous

This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

At seventeen I made seventeen thousand livin' in public housin'

Integrity in tact, reppin' hard

They askin' how he disappear and reappear back on top

Sayin', Nas must have naked pictures of God or somethin'

To keep winnin' is my way like Francis

As long as I'm breathin', I'll take chances

A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs

Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go head

So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start

So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart

I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece

But my life been good since I started finding peace

I shouldn't even be smilin', I should be angry and depressed

I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess

I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back

Like Trump bein' up down up, play with cash

Nas, we push it, mush em

Harlem, Bronx, all that

Use my tongue to tear the skin hangin' from the roof of my mouth

Shit was Falicimo, melted pot, city sweltering hot

Staggerin' drunker than those cops that 2pac shot

I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed

Reachin', soon as I heard them iron wheels screechin'

When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught

Toker man safe behind a locked door for sure

Minor theif shit, minor league shit, beastin'

Lookin' for the young, but now we older chiefin'

In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick

Buggin' on how his imagination was so sick

It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth

Alchohol agin' my niggas faster than felonies

How dare I? Must be, somethin' in the air that corrupts me

Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease

I'm here y'all



[Outro]

This for my trapped in the 90?s niggas

For my trapped in the 90?s niggas

Ha, for y'all niggas"

Rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica, Queens in his black truck
Timbs was 40 below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal

Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you

In front of you, it's foul what this money could do

Cash corrupts the loyal

I hung with E-Money, too, the fucking truth

Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad

I could've died the same night that Stretch died

I just got out of his ride

He dropped me off and drove to Springfield

November thirtieth, another Queens king killed

It fucked me up, y'all

I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute

The legal way, drug-free route

Back in the days, they was sleeping on us

Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it

Trying to leave Queens out

But we was pulling them beams out, them M3's out

Pumping bringing them D's out

Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house

Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth

Astoria warriors, 8th Street, twin buildings

Vernon, can't even count the Livingston children

Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood

Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap, though

Bridge niggas be up in Petey's ten racks, yo

A simple bet on a serious cash flow

Get money, Manolo, welcome home, Castro

Queens-bridge unified all I ask for

Let's do it for D.U, say what up to Snatch, yo

I just salute real niggas when I pass through



[Verse 2]

Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery

Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai

The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery

Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries

You be starving in Kew Gardens

Bolognas and milk from a small carton

You could still feel chills from the team

On 118, my nigga Ben fly by like it's a dream

His face on his Shirt Kings

Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking

Back when Black Rock & Ron was on the map

Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats

Thugs bark, getting amped from weed

Over the heart of champions, see

Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough



(You all know how the story go) [x3]



[Verse 3]

Any other real niggas in the world besides us, I ask?

Probably is, but odds are we'll never cross paths

Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot

And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory

Drinks in the air for my niggas not here

This how we do, I see you D.U

Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends

Crack the Patron, Hennessy, and Glenlivets

Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows

Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow

I'm a real O.G cause back in nine-three

Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little

Laid back in a rental

Mouth shining, Eddie's gold caps all up in the dental

Nigga getting money now, but you know I'm still mental, but not simple

Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot

And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory

Drinks in the air for my niggas not here

This for the fallen soldiers

Hold it down, I told ya

Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling



[Verse 4]

Watch the con realest channel his mom's spirit

Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her

Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer

Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers

And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose

Liars brag they put work in

You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin

Better stay on point, if not, it's curtains

Bebo Posse reincarnated through me, probably

If music money didn't stop me

I never claimed to be the toughest

Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed

It's the game that we was stuck with

Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids

Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went?

No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket

It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket

Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit?

Bo cooking blow, fucking slay that, where Turkey went?

Old videos show niggas that was murdered since

Another reason to get further bent

Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot

And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory

Drinks in the air for my niggas not here

This for the fallen soldiers

Hold it down, I told ya

Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling"

You cocked back, you thought you had it planned
You thought you had your man
He saw you comin', he ran when you tried to blast that man

Missed him by inches, he sprinted

Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered

Two of em pull through, but one didn't, son's finished

You took the life of him

The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him

Tight with him, why was he in the way?

Why was he standin' next to the enemy that specific day?

His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive

Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit

Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised

Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days

They never had no probs

Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage

These two different personalities had to collide

Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died

You ask why, cause of a

We grew up doin' graffiti

Now hollows heads gettin' heated

Seated in foreign cars, constantly gettin' weeded

Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars

But fuck em all, we ballin' 'til they come lock us up

Twenty to life, I'm clubbin' blowin' twenty tonight

We the Marlboro, Marley Marlin' all through the night

Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war

Snatch a tech off the shelf, live forever that's Insha'Allah

Memoirs of a rich nigga

Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers

New Benz, chrome rims off a show killer

You niggas accidental shoppers in back of the limo

Pay your ties, stay alive, can't be dodgin' my clique

Hundred check, I use your bitch for some bargainin' chips

In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul

This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't

Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up

Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha

We miss ya

And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome

How they gon' kill that beautiful sista?

Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons

Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessin'

Tell me who you impressin'?

Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them

Make em throw up they hands, choke em out playin' in wrestlin'

Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they reppin'

But they cold-blooded, homie, wonderin' where the respect went

Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas

Can't hang with these little niggas, they killin', they reckless

Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?

Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
I call it « shit for niggas with daughters« 

I call this « shit for niggas with daughters »

I call this « shit for niggas with daughters »

I call this « shit for niggas with daughters »



I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age

Who locked up, first I regretted it then caught my rage, like

How could I not protect her from this awful phase?

Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised like

A princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless

Plus she's seen me switching women, pops was on some pimp shit

She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'

So if her husband is a gangster can't be mad, I love her

Never, for her I want better, homie in jail- dead that

Wait till he come home, you can see where his head's at

Niggas got game, they be tryna live

He seen your mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is

Although you real, plus a honest kid

Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit

You 17, I got a problem with it

She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure but she rocking with it



This for niggas wit' daughters

I call this, shit for niggas wit' daughters

Yo, not sayin' that our sons are less important



Shit for niggas wit' daughters

I call this, shit for niggas wit' daughters

I call it, not sayin' that our sons are less important



This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig

This social network said « nas go and get ya kid »

She's on twitter, I know she ain't gon post no pic

Of herself underdressed, no inappropriate shit, right

Her mother cried when she answered

Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted

A box of condoms on her dresser then she instagrammed it

At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent

I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her

Shoulda drove on time to school with her

I thought I dropped enough jewels on her

Took her from private school, so she can get a balance

To public school, they too nurture teen talents

They grow fast

One day she's ya little princess, next day she talking boy business

What is this?

They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world

God get's us back, he makes us have precious little girls



And I ain't tryna mess ya thing up

But I just wanna see you dream up

I finally understand

It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man

Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons, how fathers feel for they daughters

When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa

When she date, we wait behind the door with the sawed off

Cuz we think no one is good enough for our daughters

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime cruise
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you
I see you standing there so lost and all alone

I wanna take you in my arms

And tell you that you're home

I look into your eyes

I said I know you very well

I see a mirror of my life

A reflection of myself



[Verse 1: Nas]

3:45 am can't sleep, can't dream

I'm stuck, money problems pop up

How will I survive, guess it's best to decide not to decide

So that's my decision

Whatever happens happens

I keep makin' my millions

Can see myself in presidential campaign dinners

But I'm passin' blunts around a bunch of gang members

When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles

And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you

And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest

And out grow women you love and thought you could stay with

Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror

And leave notes around for yourself to remember

I like to teach and build

With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mill

All you need is some skill, then it's grindtime

Imagination better than knowledge, say's Einstein

It's all in the mind

Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic

Just one minute after it's heard

You all excited, you all repeat it

So call me a genius, if you didn't

Now that I said it I force you to think it

Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moet

When you vision me, you vision the best

When I was young they called me, Olu's son

Now he Nas father, I was the good seed

He was the wise gardener

[Verse 2: Nas]

Beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas

Conservatives don't understand slang linguistics

The burbs talking like the hood'll change with quickness

Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness

So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious

Get out of gangsta business seen in me you basic

Try to compare what you live to the life I master

See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after

Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces

White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation

The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker

Dope fiend neighbours, growing up I've seen paper

I describe it, hope you can visualize it

This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project

When my British Knights, can rival your foamposites

Don't make me pull my lotto's out the closet

[Intro: Anthony Hamilton]
Lies and the pain
Betrayal, life

[Verse 1: Anthony Hamilton]

In danger's face

Look what you're facing, gave your heart away

And all the remedies couldn't ease the pain

All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away

In a world so cold

You gain your life just to lose your soul

Never thinking twice 'bout what the future holds

All the lies and the games not worth fighting for



[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]

The world is an addiction, serving up a fix

The world is an addiction, way too much for me



[Verse 2: Nas]

Snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest

Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets

They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me

Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out

Letter T

It's better to dead a beef than let it breathe, then we don't succeed

Cause then you gotta murder dummies

Waste your time, they allergic to money

I'm never squeamish to blood, we can thug, and get out of hand,

What's the options?

Only conclusion is shooting, bullets poppin',

Hoodlums dropping, fear any day that the feds will come knocking

Was young and nervous, asking myself what's my purpose,

In the back of a patty wagon, bracelets, aching me

Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me

These cops can't relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy



[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]

The world is an addiction, serving up a fix

The world is an addiction, way too much for me



[Verse 3: Nas]

Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments,

Know a billionaire he has everything but a fam,

Guess how angry this man gets, had so many bad chicks in his bed,

Strange sex, same sex, has addictions that are sadistic

Chain of events, habits, he puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick

Self-esteem needs boosting alcohol consumption

Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing

Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms

All along he's into bestiality porn,

And it's wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong

And I'm strong, but the female anatomy got me sprung

And these women need shoes and bags, cars and condos

Fine clothes, and these fiends needs to get high, so they find dough

To mainline dope, and ya'll know



[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]

The world is an addiction, serving up a fix

The world is an addiction, way too much for me



[Verse 4: Nas]

So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks

My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life

I'm just rebellious, not selfish,

Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is

I need the best things in life that's women, that's cars

Cigars in Venice, bottle on ice, that's priceless

The other night, just in the emergency room

A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon

Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated

He can barely concentrate, cause he's newly separated

His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance

In the house they were married in, mad people waiting

Some young, some old, heads and stomachs aching

Filling out an application, cause they all need medication

But the doctor need love or a quick vacation, calling up his travel agent

Same time, premeditating murdering his ex wife

Life, savage ain't it

Some need Xanax, just to maintain it

We all need faith cause the world keep changing

Let go of the illusion, start some restraining



[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]

Just hold on (just hold on)

Just hold on (just hold on)

Just hold on (just hold on)

Just hold on (just hold on)

Just hold on (just hold on)

Just hold on (just hold on)

Just hold on (just hold on)

Just hold on"

Louis belt hangs on the waist, it ain't even fastened

I'm trying to get every number from every woman passing me by

She's fly; black, Asian, Boriqua

Italian, mixed chicks, Middle Eastern

Eritrean, Ethiopian, how you opening?

Just rolled four with them, bout to smoke again

Rose-gold Rollie, riding the top down

Niggas jealous of Jason

Dark green seven forty, no tint

I salute the gods

Shelltoes, slim, fly nigga

And vintage fila like I'm the ghost of domencio

On any day getting throwed in a tinted vehicle

Like a old bk gangsta, but I'm the ceo

Of nasty nas enterprises, mastermind, made men

My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends

Dedication, hard work, routine builds character

In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers

Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it

Break through walls like pink floyd

And drink fluids of all kind of alcohol y all

Vineyards in france, yachts out in cannes

Now holla at a millionaire

Rollie, hublot and audemar, deciding which one to wear

Who to screw, what to drive

550 with the cream guts inside

Or the super sport range truck is fly

Gat's on us, I don't really trust these guys

Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties

If she beautiful, the lustful type

I'll hit it and bust inside

Fuck it, i'mma die one day

They gon' probably make that day a holiday

Until then, let's go on a shopping spree

Speaking for my real niggas, only ogs

Certified who kill niggas when put in that seat

Hollis Ave, Run and them but I proudly

To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct

Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates

Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow

It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke

For Vernon; 10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street

Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials

Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true

Who possesses the testicular fortitude

To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you

You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race

The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews

It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical

Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed

And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve

That's why I hate doing interviews

But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw

Habitual happiness at me you wouldn't look backwards

You would have sex on condominium roof decks

So anyone move next

I'll hit you with two techs

Rocking Roberto Cavalli no shirt on convertible Mazy

My Columbiana mommy ridin beside me

Every tat mean something, that's my word on my body

I'll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty

My niggas is ignant, put lead in yo pigment

Just cause y'all was mad at all the years I was getting it

In 97 the six

98 the Bentley

Now it's the Ghost Phantom

And ya'll can't stand 'em but...



[Hook:]

Nas the Don [x8]

In a new york city [x4]



[Verse 2:]

Army Jacket swag Army jacket green and black

With the square top pocket that snaps

Where the gas at?

Pass that, not you

You hold cracks in your ass crack

I never did that, my sock where my stash was at

Yo I used to listen to that red alert and rap attack

I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that

Cuttin school with Preme team at phat cat was at

Future not crystal clear yet Baccarat

Now I'm the one that's reppin Queens way beyond your wildest dreams

Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team

That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans

20 years in this game lookin 17

I don't lean: no codeine, promethazine

I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king

Although he's on to another chapter

Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to

Blaaaah...



[Hook]



[Verse 3:]

Yeah yeah...

New York is like an Island a big Rikers Island

The cops be out wildin, all I hear is sirens

It's all about surviving same old two step

Tryna stay alive when

They be out robbin, I been out rhyming

Since born knowledge like prophet Muhammad

Say the ink from a scholar

Worth more than the blood of a martyr

So I'm a

Keep it on til I see billion dollars

Keep your friends close and ya enemies closer

Love model chocha mommy pop it like she suppose to

Eyes red shot like I'm never sober

Big time smoker Indonesian doja

Minis me you can hold up before you get all wet up from my soldiers

Don shit

Under fire I remain on some calm shit

This for every ghetto and the hood

Nas the Don and Supercat the Don Dotta

Understood...

Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringin' home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt ya happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne

Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse

Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone

I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome

Feel like a knight from England, that's what I named my son: Knight

He was born to be one, that's how my game was won

White 740 Beamer, licked by an angel's tongue

I'm livin' dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one

Honey be pocket watchin', she got a lot of options

Hard to make up her mind decidin' which baller to rock with

Hot to death, slim pickings, but I'm not impressed

She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just...

Stay



[Verse 2]

Even though I don't like you, next Friday night can't wait to fight you

Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you

Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked

I felt bad, wait, do I got love for you?

I might kill you, but do I got love for you?

I want you dead under 6 feet of soil

At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery

We hate each other, but it's love, what a thug mystery

Years ago they ate the heart of a slain enemy

We enemies, but your hatred could never enter me

Some seek fame cause they need validation

Some say hatin' is confused admiration

Spotlight on me, I still look twenty

Still get money, lady killer pushin' a Bentley

Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer

I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to...

Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see

And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home

I wanna go through my red and my cherry

Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home

I wanna go through my red and my cherry



[Verse 1: Nas]

I want someone who like the champagne I like

My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night

She teach me how to live, she ain't afraid of life

Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life

Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before

She love or she ride out with me on my music tour

She like the herbs, natural medicine, she cooking good

She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good

For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real

Who not after material wealth, but get dough still

Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette

Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president

As long as there's no selfishness

Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident

You can be easily recruited, you're heaven sent

Your smile put me at ease

You're the woman I need, but where is she

[Verse 2: Nas]

I hate when people write me hostile texts on account of my lifestyle's perception

Invade my personal life, ??? question what are they expecting

I be trying to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in

They think forever I'm rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash

God, wouldn't they know, or am I a fool or ass

I'm well known, got people coming at me mad

I had to tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone, my bad

I drag off the L and try to silence it

The noise in my head, the curse of the talented

Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator

And that would get me off the radar

It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo and Stitch

Pour my Pino Grigio Cris with some lime what is this?

An immaculate version of Me and My Bitch by Biggie

With all respect cause you the only one that gets me

[Verse 1]
Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar that was an awesome day
Did counseling, couldn't force me to stay

Something happens when you say I do, we go astray

Why did we mess it up

We was friends, we had it all

Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault

He in the grave let it go he no longer living

Said you caught him cheating with Mom, fucking other women

Fuck that gotta do with us

Here's the keys to the newest truck

Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby do it up

No matter who you fuck, that was before me

Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming

Hate you so much right now

Should've saw the man in angry black women

Actions of a demon, I'm leaving



[Hook]

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

You know I'm saying bye-bye

Cause I'm saying bye-bye



[Verse 2]

Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave

Seven months in your pregnancy, bout to have my seed

Let's take it back some years

Rewind it to the happy years

You and your Star Trak fam

I'm thinking you cats are weird

Same time different year

I was digging y'all flow

Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know

I thought no one could stop us

Matching gold watches

I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin

Yet, the cuter version

Yet I knew you personally

Better than you knew yourself and I knew this for certain

Crib in the Dominican you got away from everybody

You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably

The highlight of my life

Like Hiyo look at my wife

Gangsta, me and twenty cops 'bout to fight, crazy night

Bailed you out, next morning we got clean

Like it never happened and later we at that Heat game

Just another day in the life of two people in love

But it wasn't enough, so baby guess what



[Hook]



[Verse 3]

Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition

Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending

With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half

Not some but half

No serious, half

Half of your soul

Half of your heart, you leaving behind

It's either that or die

I wanted peace of mind

And all I seen was selfish cowards, under they breath

Saying why did Nas trust her

But look at yourself, speak louder bro

You live with your babymoms and scared to make an honest woman out of her

And make her your bride, fake bitch you ain't even alive

At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride

Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride

He got my nose, my grill, your colour, your eyes

Next go round I hope I pick the truest type and watch me do it all again

It's a beautiful life, aight

Goodbye

Queensbridge leader, no equal

To pop thousand-dollar bottles of scotch, smoke pot and heal the people

Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cuttered

Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number

Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under

Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder

Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up

Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'

The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars

Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes

Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size

I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous

It ain't my fault, semiautomatic weapons I brought

The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy

Dick ‘em, convince ‘em all to praise me

They ideology is confusion, I lose ‘em

Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety

Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD



Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades

I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage, I am the dragon

Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend

Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans

My little Jackie Onassis, dig?

I'm so high, I never land like Mike Jackson's crib

Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib sacrilege

Talk trash about the nasty kid

Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive, talk money

Is you jokin', cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa

In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket

On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got all you envy

But don't offend, I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley

You are your car, what could represent me

Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly

Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the '90s

Drug dealer call, rush to the bar

Move, niggas, we don't give a fuck who you are

Black card heavy like a magnet, in my stitched denims

Pretty women see them them saggin', bet a hundred stacks

Niggas'll run it back just havin' fun

I ain't even begun to black, light another blunt in fact



(Nasty) Yeah, nasty kid



For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it

Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'

Saying it was Nas I used to hustle with

I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish, guns on my waist past his

Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'

And joining the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'



Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted

Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly

I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'

I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'

Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys

Been in the wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors

For my deen niggas, your flow cheap as limousine liquor

I'm no fake rap CD listener



Sit back and roll a mean swisher

Balcony is windy, looking at the stars and

I be on the Henny woozy in the head, wobblin'

Gucci pillow on the bed while she giving noggin

Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album

Thinking I should leave to a European island

Bristol or Spain, bring a book about Stalin

Dinner serenaded with a violin

But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing

Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit

Fine dining, Olive Garden

Nah bitch, Nas is in the real deal food spots on the constant

Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it

Lifestyle encompasses top notch watches

Rolexes, synonymous shit I'm coppin'

Ask her has she been around duffle bags

Full of that ""fuck you cash""

Get off the jet with me in heels, I'll cup your ass

Lookin' in my eyes sayin' ""Nas, you one lucky bastard""

Grip your clutch, you get finger fucked in the passenger

I hit the Dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter

See us in the coupe flying past ya

Esco, dress code, it changes

Harrods in England

Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging

Counting wonder in the tundra

Get humbled but disgruntled when I come through, confront ya

Let nothing slide, sly remarks

You must wanna die, but you frontin' wild

When we all know you pumpkin pie

When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates

To Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict

Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out

You are what a thug about? I'm a fuckin' juggernaut

Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up

Who don't speak, she quiet

So I can think, conspire

On my feet's [?], and sometimes sneakers

Wear ties at the Setai Miami time-pieces

Are from Zurich. It's like I'm allergic

To non-oxidolic nine

Too close

I should've left your roses at the door

They're sharper than before

And I don't want them no more

I should've left your roses at the door

They're sharper than before

I have no time to give you guidance

Barely have any fuck time either

Hefner minded like, I think you're fine, but

I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver

Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her

Or if she insecure, most are

If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off

Not a judge cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows

Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows

My tax bracket not enough blacks have it

Who should I date? Project chick or Cuban actress?

A white chick, they might flip talking that blackness

Should only attract black shit, I'm an ass magnet

If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever

Never played you, I prayed we would stay together

Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean

Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams

Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions

They some silent killers, that stress shit

That put ulcers in a lot of niggas

I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper

I done went to hell and back, you always think you right

You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight

When people like my song, you want to kill 'em right?

You resent me every time I make a million right?

You want to experience life when you calling all the shots

Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot

Have your own cash, own your own Benz

Your own house, everything, me, I understand

Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee

Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street

The first movie he made, thought that was fly

I thought you was flyer, you a fuckin' liar

Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also

Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful

Money is attractive, honey dress strapless

Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic

Stroll up in the party: titanium black car

Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah

'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours

You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star

These old heads got stories, the days they was kings

I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams

You 16, you could do 20, come home young

Catch 20 years when you 40? Holmes, you're done

What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars

Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies

A 360 in the streets real grizzly

Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning

Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with

Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders

This ain't the Truman Show; it's the human show

Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you

Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name

Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim

To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed

Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank

'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think

It's crazy how many brothers come from where I come from

Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung

Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up

Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us

Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like

""Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous""

Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble

One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle

Now we having babies, cause growing up it was just us

No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up

But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual

Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral

I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you

Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to

The G is in your genes, already you tuck

Inherit your dad's swag, it's George Jefferson's strut

Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet

Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit

Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise

No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor

I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist

Corona sipper, pass it out, might blow it with you

It ain't the Truman show; it's the human show

Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle

Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you

Young brother go and get your paper, I got love

Love, I'll trade you love

I've traded fire with you long enough

Is that all you brung? It's not love

But not about to slip 

Vision Promised Land with fashion like 

Madison Ave Manhattan 

Saks 5th Ave and 

Rodeo 

Relaxing popping labels

This where the truth's told 

Use them two holes 

Above your nose 

To see the proof yo! 

Imagine a contraption that could take us back when 

The world was run by black men 

Back to the future 

Anything can happen 

If these are the last days 

And hundred-foot waves come crashing down 

I get some hash and pounds 

Pass around the bud then watch the flood 

Can't stop apocalypse 

My synopsis is catastrophic 

If satellites is causing earthquakes 

Will we survive it 

Honestly man it's the sign of the times 

And the times at hand 



There's a lot of work to be done, oh gosh 

In the promised land



Talking 'bout promise land

Oh gosh get me to the promise land

The promise land oh the promise land

The promise land



There's plenty of land for you and I

By and by

Lost of food, to share for everyone

Cause that was civilization in the promise land

Answer to the promise land

Going to the promise land

Bet that, 300 carats the average up on the neck, black

Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss

Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche

Top down, new fashion

Seeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera

Light flashing, and I'm laughin'

My plaque's from album sales

I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see

Tell them angels open the door for me

From nine Berrettas and moving raw

To chilling in wine cellars

Sticks and humidors

That's what I call a g

That's what I call a pimp

That's what I call a gangsta

To the fullest, shit

I try to make more cream

By every September 14th, that's my dream

So I can be more clean, as I grow yearly

I can see things more clearly

That's why they fear me

This universal apartheid

I'm hog-tied, the corporate side

Blocking y'all from going to stores and buying it

First L.A. and Doug Morris was riding with it

But Newsweek article startled big wigs

They said, Nas, why is he trying it?

My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winning

Forgetting - Nas the only true rebel since the beginning

Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow

Try telling Bob Dylan, Bruce, or Billy Joel

They can't sing what's in their soul

So untitled it is

I never change nothin'

But people remember this

If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids

With new ideas being told what they can and can't spit

I can't sit and watch it

So, shit, I'm a drop it

Like it or not

You ain't gotta cop it

Cups of Don Julio

No matter what the CD called

Just to figure out you weren't dreaming in the first place

If all I saw was gangsters

Coming up as a youngster

Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one

Ain't ya happy I chose rap

I'm amongst tha

Streets deceiving

Can't believe my achievements

Cultural strata

Persona's that of a non-needer

Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver

For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless

To my g's on the flee from the coppers

Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors

From the slums I come up a phoenix

Caked up, tryna take what I'm eating

Came up a dismissive kid

You lucky if you allowed to witness this

Savvy mouth

Wild, hardly

A man's man

Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties

Jezebel's and Stella McCartney's

For years, all that

How could I not be dead

This old German

Said I was a thug with a notty head

Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled

With a face like he wonder where I got my bread

Probably all these stones he see

From my shows overseas

From crime to rhyme

My stories is I'm from the home of the thieves

Blessed

The lord is a g, he gotta be

Who's the God of suckers and snitches

The economy

Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe

Blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro

He'd want me to spit this

Only the strong survive

Nas bear witness

The hypocrisy is all I can see

White cop acquitted for murder

Black cop cop a plea

That type of shit make me stop and think

We in chronic need of a second look of the law books

And the whole race dichotomy

Too many rappers, athletes, and actors

But not enough niggas in NASA

Who give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion

But when it comes to residuals, they look past us

Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us

Even in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandanas



[Verse 3:]

Assassinations

Diplomatic relations

Killed indigenous people

Built a new nation

Involuntary labor

Took a knife split a woman naval

Took her premature baby

Let her man see you rape her

If I could travel to the 1700's

I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite

Through your covenant

Love to sit in on the Senate

And tell the whole government

Y'all don't treat women fair

She read about herself in the bible

Believing she the reason sin is here

You played her, with an apron

Like bring me my dinner, dear

She the nigger here

Ain't we in the free world

Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls

Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually

Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me

How far we really from third world savagery

You and your gold medal flour

Lay you down cause you're red hot

To the bed then, ""Plop""

So amazing, how you sparkle when I glaze you swine

The way you submitting

And how you gave me power

To messaging me to shower

You with lemon water

Marinate you with season you dipping you in chowder

It's like you at the spa

The way you gently

Lay in the pan

While you enjoying you butter milk treatment

I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling

On your skin

Despite the funny fragrance

Still I lick my finger frequent

In any event

I'm reflecting on all the signs saying that I got I shouldn't fuck with you

But the way you taste made it hard to resist when I put my mouth on you

But that's another issue

But it FLIES up in my stomach when I laid EYES on you

Was it infection manifesting?

Confused over the feeling impatiently eating you

Intestinal worm chewing on the walls of my intestine

I'm a eat you until there's nothing left

Til my very last breath

Despite your good appearance

Cooking swine as a chef

You can't stand the crunchy sound I make if you squash me

Learn to live with me

How much your roast? costing

You and the city

But yo we everywhere

Check your house I bet we there"

[Chorus: Mykel]
Where there's life there is water
We depend on mama nature
There's a message for tomorrow

Everything connects to you

Some say soon it will be over

You can see it in the weather

Out of tune with mama nature

What you do comes back to you



We're not alone [x4]



[Verse 1: Nas]

Confucius, Confucius

Sigmund Freud

And Fard Muhammad

Is it evolution or God?

Searching for the truth is a threat

Seems the closer we get to the truth

State troopers or FEDs come out to silence you

My house in Malibu probably tapped

Because living next door to Demi Moore

Plus, I'm black

Plus, I want vengeance for the poor

Who's attacked daily

Patriot Act never scared me

Jake in the Taurus

Sticky in the jar-s

Niggas I'm with got warrants

America's brown and

Twenty years from now

Every town will be brown and Latin

An African lookin Manhattan

I'm a tell you what I seen with my three eyes

Word to me, not a hoax, back in 9-9

A spacecraft in the skyline

In L.A., in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying



[Chorus: Mykel]

Every mother, every father

Raise your sons and your daughters

With respect and with honor

From the seed comes a fruit

It's an unbroken circle

All of life is universal

And we're all in the struggle

If I know one thing is true...



We're not alone [x4]



[Verse 2:]

Evidence remains in debate

Documents of our own Air Force base

Additional terrestrial information

Other planets with life population

My observation

Scientists study pictures of a flying disc

Right on earth, anthropologists are finding shit

Visitors, probably live with us

They can mimic us

It's sort of what we seeing in the cinemas



[Chorus:]

Take a look in the mirror

And see the bigger picture

It's good to be alive

It's good to be alive

Nobody is an island

We are part of an environment

Only way we gone survive

Is if we harmonize



We're not alone [x4]



[Verse 3:]

Reginald Lewis

The black billionaire

Before Oprah or Bob Johnson

How'd he disappear?

Conspiracy theories, UFO's in the air

I've seen it with my own two eyes

And I swear, like Warren Buffet

Real money I'm just trying to touch it

The diamond-encrusted shit, live illustrious

'Cause we was deprived of it, suffered

Now we pop to prove anything's possible

My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us

Now we diddy-bop just to show you that our strength's up

Just when niggas about to see they cut

Global warming about to burn us up

Niggas never really seen paper in this world

American blacks the teenager of this world

Give us twenty more years to grow up

Already geniuses; what I mean is this

I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer

'Til I read the words of Ivan van Sertima

He inserted something in me

That made me feel worthier

Now I spit revolution

I'm his hood interpreter



[Chorus:]

Take a look in the mirror

And see the bigger picture

It's good to be alive

It's good to be alive

Nobody is an island

We are part of an environment

Only way we gone survive

Is if we harmonize



We're not alone [x4]"

Got us in the box
Solitary confinement
How violent are these cops?
They need an early retirement
How many rallies will I watch?

I ain't got it in me to march

I got a semi to spark

The game's in a drought

Public housing, projects

Cooking up in the Pyrex

My set, my click

Either getting money

Or running from homicide trial

That's if they ain't died yet

Trying to be rich

Still I'm pledging allegiance

A predicate felon, a ghetto leader

Lending my poetical genius

To whoever may need it

I bleed this from Queensbridge

Now living with my feet up

Never defeated

So a president's needed

Y'know these colored folks and Negroes

Hate to see one of their own succeeding

America, suprise us

And let a black man guide us



What's the black pres thinkin on election night

Is it how can I protect my life?

Protect my wife? Protect my rights?

Every other president was nottin' less than white

'Cept Thoman Jefferson and mixed indian blood

And calvin coolers

KKK is like 'what the fuck', loadin' they guns up

I'm loadin' mine too, Ready to ride

Cause I'm ridin with my crew

He dies - we die too

But on a positive side, I think Obama provides

Hope - and challenges minds

Of all races and colours to erase the hate

And try and love one another, so many political snakes

We in need of a break, I'm thinkin' I can trust this brotha

But will he keep it way real?

Every innocent n! gga in jail - gets out on appeal

When he wins - will he really care still?

In love with a slave master

What?

Politics, politricks

Deacon for defense

Progress-producer

Nothing on the stove

Your survival-booster

Gotta do what we gotta do

We ain't got no governors coming through - to help

Anything we need done, we gotta do for self

New-improved JFK on the way

It ain't the 60's again

My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fullies 
Brrat, cars peel, the east coast cartel 
Rats get they tail snapped and trapped 
It's snitches in the streets and it's snitches in rap 
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya 

Coroner choruses, some from the Bridge to Astoria 

Dreams of fallin' in a elevator passin' floors 

Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall 

I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers 

Picture ya tarot cards and bodyguards gettin' sprayed up 

Sabotagin' my make-up, my watches get laced up 

Even if they indited Jacob 

Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off 

The frivolated shock to ya chest, try to cough 

They die and hit Hell from a iron 

I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit 

Got bitches high as Hell and they fuckin' like AIDS don't exist 

They get sent to ya hotel or made in this shit 

Put a barrel in the capo mouth, 'til his scalp come out 

You a kid, you don't live what you rap about 

Came poetic, too many haters to count 

Too much paper to count, QB bitch 



[Chorus: x2]

Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn 

Money over bullshit, pistols over brawlin' 

Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 

Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 



[Verse 2:] 

Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper black carpet 

Thinkin' 'bout which nigga to target 

You kill a nigga today, he lives forever 

So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no martyrs 

Black tech on the table, mag four-four 

Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door 

Black fish eggs nigga, that's the caviar 

You niggas is fish made, y'all niggas is fifth grade niggas 

It's fifty ways to die said the general 

I give you the top five, you will not survive 

Rule 1 cocksucker keep my name from ya tongue 

Rule 2 thought you knew don't fuck wit' God's Son 

Rule 3, see, matter fact I'll just wait 

If y'all reach top five then I'mma eat y'all alive 

Each one of you guys that claim hip-hop is still alive 

Like y'all ain't in agreement wit' Nas 

I said it's dead muthafucka, it's dead bitch

From crack pushers to 'Lac pushers, and ambushers 

And morticians to fortresses, case dismisses 

Laced in riches, cake ridiculous, from nickel and dimin' 

To trickin' them diamonds, Vegas, places in Switzerland 

From nine blast to the auto, have to blast mine 

They blast mine, black nine, you flatline, my cash climb 

Buy rare art, antique pieces, Mona Lisas 

Own, no leases, five star restaurant eaters 

Don't forget who ya peeps is, 'pose to dyin' wit' you 

Sip that good wine wit' you, only if they grind wit' you 

Or slang for ya, seen niggas live, laugh, party and 

Die on that very same corner 

Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable 

Private planes landed out in ???, weed I twirl 

Once even gave me a phobia, that I'll be in the spot 

Trapped like a Madam Zenobias wit' this kid eyein' my Rolly, yo

Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off

When the phone ring, the house lights flash 

Turned down the sound, let's get down to bidness 

Shit about to go down wit' some foul niggas

I put the guap up, get the boy popped 

He say ""son stop, it's dudes you feedin' 

Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'"" 

Dog, why you callin' me? This our food 

You, handle the mouths that it trickles down to 

Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too 

But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich 

Don't bother me wit' silly shit, call Rico 

He said ""it IS Rico, of all people 

Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor 

To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather"" 

Said the nigga shot up my cars 

Last night he laid for me to come out my doors?

The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don 

What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah 

Packed the nines, yo this nigga's asinine 

Smack ya mom, relaxed and calm, then mack ya mom 

In a casket, you'll get ya fashion on 

You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die 

You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' wit' Nas 

Remember anyone can get it at anytime 

Lames'll swear by ya name, when they lie 

Get hit wit' the lone star, ripped where ya bones are 

So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-O-1? 

In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser 

Merk you wit'cha own shooters

Wasn't Sylvia's fault or 'cause MC's skills are loss 

It's 'cause we can't see ourselves as a boss 

Deep rooted through slavery, self hatred

Wit' the fingers intertwined in some gang sign madness 

I got an exam to see if y'all pass it 

Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest 

Some of you new rappers I don't understand ya code 

You have ya man shoot you like in that Soprano episode 

Do anything to get in the game, mixtapes 

You spit hate against bosses, hungry fucks are marvelous 

You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate 

Vocalists, niggas I could have wrote ya shit 

I had off time, was bored wit' this, I could have made my double LP 

Just by samplin' different parts of ??? 

Still came five on the charts wit' zero audience 

The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit 

Y'all got awards for ya bricks, it got good to ya 

You started tellin' the bigger dogs to call it quits? What?!

Now niggas got the studio poppin' it's mad clearer 

Engineers got us ear plugs and still hear us 

The live in the park sound 

Versus the state of the art sound we on the charts now 

From British walkers and Argyles 

Look at us rap stars now, wit' our black cards now 

Fortune 500 listed, brunch at Cipriani's 

Sippin', blunted, wit' rich white guys around me 

Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up 

'Cause I'm what, every dime lust 

We use to be a ghetto secret, can't make my mind up 

If I want that, or the whole world of people

Found the body dead in the isles

What a scam! While these two compete on who's the star of the show 

Golden Legs there makes off wit' the dough 

I read the paper there wit' Joe the Butcher 

He says ""one glance is all it took ya"" she's a real looker 

They say her old man's a bootlegger, transport in any weather 

And at this rate we'll never get her 

Fellas, think it's time I call it a night 

All this talk of mystery dames gettin' me tight 

Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right 

Hate to spoil the party, what are you guys havin'? 

The same? Waiter, another round for the gang 

It's strange how I always felt out of place 

Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckleface 

So I said ""see ya later"" 

Before I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers 

He met them in Louisiana wrestlin' gators 

An idiot can tell they're involved in the caper 

So I pulled the revolver out my waist up 

Between a patrol car and a gray truck 

Behind the streetlamp was a silhouette 

White gloves and a real long cigarette 

Whaddaya know? All this time she's got me in the scope 

She spoke, says ""the devil got you guys by the choke 

""Your conspiracy theories won't work wit'out evidence

Says you guys did it Doggystyle, is he lyin'? 

She says ""Walk This Way I'll tell you a Children's Story"" 

We hit the bodega, got her a few forties 

We jumped in my ride, we drove and she cried 

Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide 

Swalllowed It! Whole bottle's half empty 

Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy 

The truth came out as we got to her Suave House 

Chopped-N-Screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch 

I said ""it's gettin' late c'mon, give it to me straight 

Who's your sponsor, lady?"" She says ""Bill Gates"" 

""What are you born, '77 or '78?"" 

She said ""nah goes way to an earlier date"" 

Slave times, played for slave said rhymes 

But she fell in love wit' some fella named Clive 

Who? Clive Campbell from Cedrick Ave 

The Bronx, now she shows me the cash 

I said ""who's Clive, don't play with me skirt"" 

She said ""Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc"" 



Ah-ha! Ah-ha! 



Listen up sweetheart, now we're gettin' somewhere 

As she's talkin', she starts vanishin' in thin air 

But before she drops the money bag on the floor and died 

She said ""if you really love me I'll come back alive"""

I feel like a black republican,money i got comin in

Can't turn my back on the hood, i got love for em

Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em

Prolly in the back of the hood, like fuck it then



Hovering over the oven, we were like brothers then

Though you were nothing another then the son of ma momma's friend

We had governin', who would have thought the love would end

Like ice cold albums, all good things

Grab a dope, sing the same song that all hoods sing

It was all would bring, all could could bring

We would bicker like the other fools,but talk good game

Never imagine all of the diaster that one could bring

Good friend you should blame the game, I could

Its kill or be killed, my good I reframe

Forever be in debt that's never a good thing

The pressure of success can put a good strain

But a friend you call best, but yes it could bring

Out of the worst in every person, even the good saint

Though we were cursed, the shit ain't tha same

When you cook cane at the age of sixteen

Then you mix things like cars, jewelries, and this thing

Jealously, ego and pride and this brings

All into the head, like a coin, chang ching

The route of all evil strike again, this could sting

Now the team got beat between the post and the point

This puts the ring in jeopardy



I feel like a black republican,money i got comin in

Can't turn my back on the hood, i got love for em

Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em

Prolly in the back of the hood, like fuck it then



[Nas:]

I feel like black militant, taking over the government

Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love em

Can't clean up my act up for good, too much thug in em

Prolly in the back of the hood, like fuck it then



I'm back in the hood, everyone's like ""Hey Nas""

Blowin on purple, reflecting on they lives

Couple of fat cats, couple of A I's

Dreamin' on fly shit, instead of the great skies

They bring 5's, hate Nas, wishin i bring guys

[?], the niggaz sing ""why?""

Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jailtime

Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs

Standing on the roof of my building, 

I'm feeling the whirlwind of beef I inhale in, 

just like an acrobat, ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire

Sippin on [?], bulletproof undermere

Could be the forces of darkness are against hood angels of good, that forms street politics

Makes a sweet honest kid turn to legal for commerce, to get his feet out of them Converse



I feel like a black republican,money i got comin in

Can't turn my back on the hood, i got love for em

Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em

Prolly in the back of the hood, like fuck it then



I feel like black militant, taking over the government

Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love em

Can't clean up my act up for good, too much thug in em

Prolly in the back of the hood, like fuck it then"

[Nas: laughs] 

Yeah my man Kool G Rap told me son do not look back 

Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax 

When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em 

At this point in my life I'm all about chillin' 

Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies 

And twist, homie's hermano just died I gotta let it ride 

That's what I got the public thinkin' my nigga 

Just cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit my nigga 

I know who died before the body dropped 

I know the guns that were used how much money the shooter got 

Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all 

The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time 

Is all we talk when we talk of New York y'all 

Who to call and who to stay away from 

Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe son 

Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up 

What cars and what trucks they drive in what towns 

They spend the most time in when they grindin' 

I found out most of them are cowards they hidin' 

Behind reputations that's sour

First thing that happen when you make a little paper 

You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper 

Till you come across some ever more flyer paper 

Realize that five-star 'tellies are even greater 

Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit 

Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it 

First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes 

All those things you still ain't really doin' shit kid 

Cause in reality I'll learn my salary 

The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me 

It kinda make me wanna hate bling it's a race thing 

How they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact 

Real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings 

Whores charge niggas with raping 

Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars 

Watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars 

So they counter the laws to take what's ours 

Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge 

So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars 

Instead of goin' back I'm buying the projects 

But I'm not going back the hood's in me forever y'all 

But I'm not going back

Some people (Yeah) 
Some people (unh-unh) 
Some people really are 

Still dreaming (And as the sun sets 

and the night falls) 

They are still dreaming (and them hoes call) 



[Verse 1: Kane West] 

He pulled up at 6:30 in his 745 

As he wavin' his shorty hi, you know he showin' his bling out 

She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out 

His girl call, feelin' she mad, she threw the ring out 

How she found out, she dreamt the whole thing out 

Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out 

When you go to sleep, what do you think 'bout? 

If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out 

Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out 

Or grab ya roller skates and, turn a roller rink out 

You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle 

Meanwhile, she out, doin' the same thing now 

Nightmares from ya dream gal make ya scream out 



[Chorus: sample + Kanye & Nas] 

Some people really (still dreamin') 

Some people really (make ya scream out) 

Some people really are (still) 

Still dreaming (st-still dreamin') 

(O-o-o-o-one two one two 

Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) 

They are still dreaming 

(O-o-o-o-one two one two 

Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) 



Some people really 

Some people really 

Some people really are 



[Verse 2: Nas] 

How you a man waitin' for the next man to get rich? 

Yo' plan is to stick out yo' hand real quick 

So if he feed ya family and he serve you shit 

Then he need that head you get and he deserve ya bitch 

Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all ya life 

Dwellin' on the past when you was alright 

When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright 

Now ya luck down you feel like, bustin' them shells 

Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self 

Want niggas to show you, how to come up wit' green 

I scheme since I'm fourteens, what the fuck was your dream? 

Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen 

Wit' little niggas wit' a chain you was doin' ya thing 

How high was I? You the thousandth guy 

That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye 

We on a different echelon, coulda got bread together 

Now you gets deaded on 



[Chorus: sample + Kanye & Nas] 

Some people really (so keep dreamin') 

Some people really 

Some people really are (still dreamin') 

Still dreaming 

(O-o-o-o-one two one two 

Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) (still dreamin') 

They are still dreaming 

(O-o-o-o-one two one two 

Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) (still dreamin') 



Some people really 

Some people really 

Some people really are 



[Verse 3: Nas] 

She had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle 

Large master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure 

Belaney by the glassful, said she been meanin' to ask who 

Would need a cash rule, who could blast tools 

And I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news 

But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school 

Grew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews 

She worked for Fox News 

One of her mans that she lent her drop to 

Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it 

Says it's important that it looks like an accident 

She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it 

Sheets was recordin had a wire, askin' shit 

Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks 

Crossed the line from her world of news castin' 

To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards 

Still dreamin'

[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot

I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation



[Verse 1: Nas]

Yea, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin'

Salivatin' at the mouth, South to East Orange

Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it

You'll be givin' up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it

For legal fees in the penal dorm

Screamin' on the horn with 'bout thirty years on your conscience

I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'

Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'

Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence (When the block is hot)

Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates

Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in

Ways spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition aging (I gotta... When the

block is hot)

I got families I'm feeding 'cause my mans is bleeding

Every five seconds look in all directions

I come through prepared; I give 'em a call

I'm close, bring them guns downstairs



[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]

I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot

I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation



I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot (hold it down)

I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation



[Verse 2: Nas]

Uh, uh, it's beef week, Monday, murder

Two niggaz dead, Tuesday

Wednesday and Thursday is hearse-day

Friday, somebody-gotta-die-day

Saturday, put the gat away

Chillin' wit your chick and a bag of haze

Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way

'Cause Sunday back to gunplay

Mo' shit start over nothin'

And get finished quick 'cause the art of repercussion

Yeah, I seen it, a G' going out indecent (When the block is hot)

Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret

Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15

Then one-time intervene (I gotta lay...)

My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die

But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die

You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty

But he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his forties



[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]

I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot

I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation



I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot

I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation



[Verse 3: Nas]

(I gotta...) Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob

(When the block is hot) A man rather die than live on his knees and starve

Cops steady askin' your man what happened

First he tell then he stop, like he not really rattin'

Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off (When the block is hot)

Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star

The rain hurt niggaz bones who been shot

Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop

The streets lie, (When the block is hot) so you better be cautious

Your man'll fry you plus, everybody talkin'

A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in

Make your own path, be a legend in your skin

(Hold down the block, when the block is hot)

Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm forcin'

Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them

Queensbridge projects has taught him, and that's for life

You heard me right, I got the block (When the block is hot)



[Outro: Mark B. Mayfield]

When the block is hot

I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot

I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot

I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation"

Yo I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Hailey got blazed before they told stories, 
Well I'm gonna get blazed before I tell y'all stories, 
I saw on TV today this man lost his son, his son died, 
So he had him cremated, took his ashes, and made it into a diamond ring 
Now he watch his son shine everyday, 

I just thought about that, while I sit here ashin in this ash tray 



[Verse 1:]

The makin' of a mad man who entered stories of Devante Swing, 

Eva Gardner, the crashin of James Dean, 

Bobby Brown, influenced by Rick James it goes, 

Prince wanted Alexander O' Neill to be Morris Day or Jerome, 

But Alex was puttin' coke in his nose nigga while it, 

Could be a myth but I swear that the source was close, Phyllis Hyman, 

Killed himself it was crazy, mommy was bad, they say, 

Donny Hathaway freefall from a balcony, he sways 



[Chorus:]

As a blunt ash falls into the ashtray, I can see my whole life fly past me, 

Did I (Did I) keep it gangsta or keep it classy, and will the money and fame outlast me, 

The blunt's ash fall down in the ash tray, will I see my whole life fly past me, 

I'm askin did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, (did I) anything else you wanna know, just ask me. 



[Verse 2:]

Sam trusted Womack with his main lady, he tossin' in the grave like 'this is how you repay me,' 

A change goin' come, wish you didn't trust me so much, 

Marvin said 'No mountains high enough,' fly stuff, 

David Ruffin was punchin' Tammy Tyrell, gave her concussions, 

While, the Funk Brothers was layin' down the percussions, 

When Flow from the Supremes died, Diana Ross cried, 

Many people said that she was laughing inside (Why?). 



[Chorus:]

As a blunt ash falls into the ashtray, I can see my whole life fly past me, 

Did I (Did I) keep it gangsta or keep it classy, and will the money and fame outlast me, 

The blunt's ash fall down in the ash tray, will I see my whole life fly past me, 

I'm askin did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, (did I) anything else you wanna know, just ask me. 



[Verse 3:]

John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery, it interests me, 

Julie Campbell in Gucci sandals, she's what a temptress be, 

The death of Anis Cosby, what a mystery, 

All of Chicago and Herald Washington, someone is sabotagin' him, 

Watch out for the traps, Larry Troutman killed his brother, Roger Troutman, then he killed himself, that's the end of zat, 

And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats, 

This is what came from they pain, from they hurt we gain, an unfair exchange. 



[Chorus:]

As a blunt ash falls into the ashtray, I can see my whole life fly past me, 

Did I (Did I) keep it gangsta or keep it classy, and will the money and fame outlast me, 

The blunt's ash fall down in the ash tray, will I see my whole life fly past me, 

I'm askin did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, (did I) anything else you wanna know, just ask me 



I can smell old bogie's cigars, 

Knall Recam's perfumes smellin just as sweet, 

Me and my wife K flyin in the drop-top like Ruby and OZ Davis baby, know what I mean, 

Yo man, get smoked out, start thinking about Hadie McDaniels, 

Got an Oscar for playing Mamie in ?Gone With the Wind,? 

And she didn't even get allowed, wasn't allowed to go to the premier, 

You believe that, couldn't go to premier, to her joint, 

Man, you know they were strong back then yeah, 

Blunts, fallin, ashtray"

...Let there be light 
No gangbanging in New York tonight 
Just murals of Biggie Smalls bigger than life 

Turn up the kid mic because ya'll anit listening right 

What's all this talk that Nas got hawked? 

I'd rather outline my body in white chalk 

Anit nobody been where I been they at standstill 

This is all overseen by man Will 



[Hook:]

As I walk through the valley of shadow of death 

I know that I ain't got much time left 

And they don't really wanna see the good in me 

Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me 

And all my business all my sin is straight ?? 

and thank the hood for all the love they gave 

Forgive em all for all in this to hate

ohhh let their be light 



[Verse 2:]

This anit to glorify just painting a street picture 

There's no goddess or bibles just blunts and swishers 

Gillette's cut caine in the kitchen 

Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth ?Supreme? Griffin 

It's like the same difference except when nigga's get arraigned 

They don't want the same sentence, nigga's get to snitching 

If I could reverse the minds and turn falls to rises and bring back nigga's who livest 

Old hustlers reminiscing on better days they home 

Doing nothing might as well be in a cage 

Hating on young brothers one foot in the grave 

They used to love us until we found our own way through the maze 

New York set trippin and flagging west coast laughing 

Now Esco's asking, what happened ? 

My home girl from Upper Manhattan she remembers the quarters thats latin 

A lot of rat-a-tat-tatting 



[Hook]



[Verse 3:]

The son of the audio cassette era, tech wearer 

Bullets and burgettes Benz Bo speak a terror 

Demand I get mine till I'm dead so I can drop something red 

Like that horse standing on its hind legs 

Since Arnold and Willis in there bunk beds 

I went and bread like wonder 

Not Ned the wineo like the parents of Lionel 

Nas is the ghetto American idol 

No matter what you do your never getting my title 

I can't sound smart because you'll run away 

They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about yay 

Like there's no other way for an ex hustler, cake getter, 

Ex rich splitter to touch ya 

I beg to differ 

When your fours years in the game we can have a conversation 

Eight years in the game I'll invite you on vacation 

Ten years in the game 

After I've enjoyed my fame, 

only then I'll let you pick my brain 

Niggas



Right about now,

I don't have to deal with all that garbage

We getting real right you know

This isTr? Williams, Ladies & Gentlemen

Focus on good things man, good times

Heh heh, alright

[Nas:]
There comes a day in ya life
When ya wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch

When you old perhaps

Wanna gather your thoughts

Have a cold one, brag

To your grandkids on how life is golden

So I'ma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib

Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did

All the money and fame, 8x10's of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame

Colliding with big names that coulda made your career stop

All that, and your man is still here, and I'm still hot

Wow! I need a moment y'all, see I almost felt a tear drop...



[Bridge:]

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?

Nas, the millionaire, the mansion

When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?

Never on schedule, but always on time



[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]

These streets hold my deepest days

This hood taught me golden ways

Made me (truly this is what made me)

Break me (not a thing's gonna break me)

These streets hold my deepest days

This hood taught me golden ways

Made me (truly this is what made me)

Break me (not a thing's gonna break me)

Ooooh I'm that history, I'm that block

I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot

I'm that kid by the numbers spot

That's my past that made me hot!

Here's my lifelong anthem: Can't forget about you!! [Nat King Cole sample in background as Chrisette ad-libs]



[Verse 2: Nas]

Can't forget about the old school

Bam, Caz, Mele Mel, Flash

Rock Steady spinning on their back

Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy

Fresh Prince - Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since

So irregular, how it mess you up when Mr. T became a wrestler

Can't forget about Jordan's retirement

The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals, kid

Some things are forever, some things are not

It's the things we remember that gave the world shock

They stay in a place in your mind so snug

Like who the person was with whom you first made love



[Bridge]



[Chorus]



[Verse 3: Nas]

Unforgettable, unsubmittable

I go by ""N"" now, just one syllable

It's the end 'cause the game's tired

It's the same vibe Good Times had right after James died

That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired

Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines (creative liiiines)

And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times

But I'm a dreamer, nostalgic with the state of mind

The past the past, enough of it, aight then

But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson (Tyson)

Or Mike when his talk was live

Or when he first did the moonwalk on Motown 25

Nas, he a QB-QB true G
Do the history



Way before The Firm, like back in the day

Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre

So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face

The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away

But we still get together like every several years

to sprinkle, a little bit of Heaven for your ears

Relax sippin' Calico in Rio, stupid fuckers

Low-key, know G's, but it's still Gucci luggage

I love Cape Cod, and watchin' fly bitches with grey eyes

wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by

I like to celebrate, why? - 'cause I can vision

collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate

So every breath I take, is all about the rules

It's hard for you to breathe like you at high altitude

So crack the Patron, it's on heathens, The God's back

Hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'



[Chorus #1]

Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders

Make that cake, cop two five fivers

Pimps and players, platinum diamonds

East to West Coast we riders



[Chorus #2: Nas (The Game)]

He a Compton-Compton O.G.

(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)

(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks

(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots



[The Game]

1995, eleven years from the day

I'm in the record shop with choices to make

""Illmatic"" on the top shelf, ""The Chronic"" on the left homie

Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me

So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub sack

Ripped the package off ""Illmatic"" and bumped that

For my niggaz it was too complex when Nas rhymed

I was the only Compton nigga with a ""New York State of Mind""

Inside the dope house bottlin' up sherm, bangin' The Firm

Dre was king then so I waited my turn

Fast forward, now I'm makin 'em burn

Ended my peers careers, hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned

So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga

I stopped beefin' with niggaz, 'cause I'm ""Ether"" to niggaz

Comb the earth 'til there's no one left

""If I Ruled the World"" I summons all you weak rap niggaz to death



[Chorus: Nas (The Game)]

He a Compton-Compton O.G.

(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)

(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks

(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots



[Nas]

Yo, the Jordans sportin'

Come off the dice game with a fortune walkin', you a walkin' coffin'

The musket I tucked it, you bluff it I bust it

You're sideways talkin', so I lay often

I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'

Fuck ass niggaz, get bucked ass niggaz

Pluck ashes - of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas

That's my name and I came with Rugers this time

And if I'm sane that ""Soul Plane"" movie's the bomb

Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm

You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me

Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm bustin'

See that's malarky you yappin'

I open up the tripod to put the gatling on, and I start clappin'

Nasty man, from baggin' grams and runnin' from cops

to a mill' on the hand, a mill' on the watch, I'm fuckin' with Doc



[Chorus #1]

Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders

Make that cake, cop two five fivers

Pimps and players, platinum diamonds

East to West Coast we ridin'



[Chorus #2: Nas (The Game)]

He a Compton-Compton O.G.

(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)

They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em [x7]
Yeah



[Verse 1: Nas]

They dug me out the soil in the Mines of the Motherland

Now I'm misplaced, one hand to another hand

Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'

Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again

Yeah, guess that's how we got here

Slave Trade then the Diamond Trade

Every child's afraid

When his Mother and Father get sprayed

Forced in the Army, young killer Brigade

Gets a new name and then he give his nose glue

Til' his mind can't take what he's gon' through

Lookin' in that dirt for that ice so blue

Then The Royal Family, the ice goes to

And this thing has to change, feelin' half-ashamed

As I rap with my Platinum chain

When you shop for a gift for me

You think about the misery?

The same way we made Apartheid History

We can do the same thing to the conflict ice

But everybody wanna shine, right?



[HooK: Nas]

Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead

Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed

Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead

Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed

They wanna Shine on 'em

Shine on 'em [x7]



[Verse 2: Nas]

My VVS glimmers on my chest

200-thou-encrusted watch on my wrist

I wonder how people starve to death

When God bless the land that lacks the harvest

The stone's equality, but they homes are poverty

And the whole world ignores the robbery

Bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me

Tear-drop shaped, uh, perfect Clarity

It shocks, so many are killed annually

'Cause of greed, lust, and pure Vanity

Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it

Every Holiday Season, Jewelry stores crowded

Kids snatched from their homes, Mutilated alive

Husbands separated from wives, keep a Jesus piece to be fly

But back in the day there was a time when they called us shine



[HooK: Nas]

Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead

Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed

Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead

Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed

They wanna shine on 'em

Shine on 'em [x7]

I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days

In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze

I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke

That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off

The infrastructure caves in, amazin'

I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men

Serve niggaz, bird niggaz speakin' reckless

When their momma love the kid's records I made

You gutless, you don't know struggle

Throw a couple slugs at you, hell grabs you

Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine

I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen

Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand

I'ma guide you like the OG, but don't talk, don't get it confused

'Cause none'a y'all can fit in my shoes

Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions

God'll forgive you bastards

Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage



[Verse 2: Nas]

I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?

Form a crew, swallow forty cal' bullets after dinner's finished

Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full'a scrilla

Can't come close to, Francis Copala, Samson -- no Delilah

You're pint-sized, I'm mic's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it

You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap

Tell you a story shorty, spicy like lories

Chickenheads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties

Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours

Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes

Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys

Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage

You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage



[Verse 3: Nas]

Son's backward flows, they say mine is very scary

Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies

And all of y'all wear that same aroma

How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya

You're wack nigga, face it

In the history of the game, you have no placement

Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity

Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth

But when the sun go south, them comes come out

My cavalry woulda been threw ten in your skin

We ain't got no choices who to choose

Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices

And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites

Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools

About poor children, then she gotta prove that she

ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool

Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules

Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused

Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose

Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry

On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey

You MC's on that old slavery path

The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh

See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves

Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin'

It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening

This man leans in, his boys laughing

Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens

Says, ""Since all Black women care about is who got dough

And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black hoe""

I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold

Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go

The biggest example in scandal of history

Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree

Most woman who love Jeevanji of Gucci

Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies

But who are we to blame, not the dames

It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same

Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth

So they deserve to earn man's purse

Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime

Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh

'Cause they said they played they parts well

Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail

Whitey always tell him, ""Ooh, he speak so well""

Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?

The acceptable Negro -- hell nah

But they say, ""These are our heroes""

Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud

But there's somethin' they don't say

Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay

From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe

First he played his life cool just like Michael

Now he rock ice too just like I do

Yo, you can't do better than that?

The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?

Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back

Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you

You turn around then you shit on Shaq

Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes

He love a little butt crack, got enough cash

Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you

To do something for the youth, stupid spoof

But you let them use you as an example

They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full

You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles

But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through

But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black

but your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque

You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface

You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe

Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it

Huh, and in the end we all got dicked

These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot

Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks

Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout

Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson

Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them

Nicky Giovanni poetical black female

Jim Brown to the people who sing well from

Fela to Miriam Makeba

The mirror says you are the next American leader

So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records

These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records

Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC

But next year, who knows what we'll see?

Ha-Ha, these are our heroes

Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage

Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car

All red ferari, Florida where we met at a redlight

Homeboy bumpin' my old shit

They wildin' with some freaks from the islands

piled in behind him, limosine, Benz

He shouted, ""Nas, roll with us""

I'm bored so I followed him

Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins

He put me on to Don, nice ass with a set of mean twins

Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend

I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything

Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove

War stories about dudes both of us know

Never heard drunken words spoken so slow

A year go by, the nigga was fly

Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high

Got a call, he's in N.Y

Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by

for a season where he's at

Greets me with a smile, told him ""Here keep that""

Next week got a call from his wife

Said somebody done took son life

'Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou

H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road

Left him there on this 'cain, clothes stained with his brain

My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up

Arrangement's a closed casket

See now a hoe has to, maintain with his fake gang

sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it

Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian

Brag about how the streets needed a changin'

cause I promise you you'll regret it bro



Picture my last days will be so grim

My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me

Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something

Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words

Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to

I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career

But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts

I would hit the scene for a second and bounce

Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick

Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it

Sex, I dropped pearl necklaces on necks and tits

Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it

From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me

You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with

So live now nigga

It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis

You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis

Gotta respect you 'cause you never tied to smash

Since we met a while back, and your style was mack

Now I see that you a man after all you been through

A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou

Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could

But the white cells in my blood were no good

Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier

I thought, ""Me a victim?"", could never be my character

It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him

Just happy it didn't get in our kid

But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless

Remember days of diamond cuts

Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars

Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize

I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards

Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs

To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor

Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules

All the planes I flew, niggaz I ran through

Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from

Grimy niggaz, rich niggaz, damn it ain't a game son

From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands

Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces

Critics and fans, they need to get a life

You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now

I grew with you so you know you make me proud

And most of all you gotta live now



[Chorus: Scarlett]

Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you

We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you

LIFE, dead presidents, devilish meant

Overthrow king thrones just 'cause of their negligence

DEATH, real shit'll start comin' to light

Niggaz you ain't like dickin' your wife, WHAT?

Kind and underminding, grimy, stiff corpse shapin'

Pork bacon, double-cross Satan

HEATHENS, non-god-fearing, lace thong wearing demons

But glory go to God, y'all BENEATH HIM

If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat

He'll show you streets where them big dealers DROVE AT

Where low-key killers let the fo' clap

Blocka-blocka-blocka -- OH

The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows

Everything a hood brother thing he needs -- YO

You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap

And I'ma use that for the

Burnt-out, kicked to the curb

So I had to learn how to turn around a hundred thou' REAL FAST

In '95 that was my last, I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the PAST

Rest in peace E Money Bags, no more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash

Lawyer want CASH, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who gell

They burnt a range with a mollet of COCKTAIL

My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover

Them cops SWEAR, my little nigga told on me

I'm thinkin, ""Hello, where's the L-O, V-E""

Pigs play games, my little man'll never say names

Word to his pops with elephant veins

They both locked-up still, word to Will

I'll make it and chill for the

My man gave his mommy coke

So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke

DAMN NIGGA, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms

so she don't have to bone for DIMES?

Or give dome for nicks' in the roofs of the projects

where dogs shit and PISS

Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed

Lexus coup-ed, brigettes from cubics

Mighta been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six BARS

To ten LP's, what can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?

I'M NAS, on a track that's unorthodox

Like my life coulda been offed by THE COPS

Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale

Can we please have a moment of silence?
That's for my niggaz doin' years in confinement
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor?

Symobolizin', let's take in time to consider that

Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here

And we gon' rep 'til slugs kill us here

This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain

Smokin' trauma, sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine

Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to stop and get by

To live it alive, so instead they live it to die

Can we please have a moment of peace?

For every G that fell for his flag in the streets

Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin'

Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin'

Or just for poor righteous teachin'



[Chorus: Quan sings]

As day comes and night falls

For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all

And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn

While wishin' y'all were home



[Verse 2: Nas]

Yeah, and can we have another moment of silence?

For brothers who died from black-on-black violence

From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds

To clients all over the world, got little Black girls dyin'

And can we please pour some more liquors?

For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggaz

Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan

It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on

Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets

And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest

And can we please have a moment of truth?

For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots

And families back home who pray they make it home safe

Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles

This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you

Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you

Let's take 'em home



[Chorus]



[Verse 3: Quan]

And can we please have a moment to mourn?

For Pac, Biggie and Pun 'cause through us they live on

Jam Master Jay, Freaky Ty and Aaliyah

Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya

Can we please have a moment for children?

Who got raped or murdered, or trapped in the system

Who never knew their father, never learned to dream

But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends

For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad

Bustin' her ass to give her kids shit she never had

For my niggaz in the pen hopin' rhymes'll get 'em signed

So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime

For every mother that held a son in the street bleedin'

Cryin' a song of sorow to dark and deep for speakin'

Just a moment outside the day to day struggle

To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?

[Verse 1: Nas]

By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'

If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'

Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one

By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment

And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects

Watchin' them older niggaz pass pot and they high man

I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy

Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me

So I would go to school and try to get good grades

Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids

So she cussed them, said ""My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum""

They judged us, thinking that we dumb 'cause where we come from

Got a little older and now I see

Young niggaz wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)



[Chorus: Woman singing]

I see people hating other people

Tell me what's the reason

That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money

What's the reason?

For these wars we're fighting with each other

Season after season

When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'

What's the reason?



[Verse 2: Nas]

Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave

She never had it, it's not hers to begin with

She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners

Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on

Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid

Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'

Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?

I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing

Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?

Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?

Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'

But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated

A man feels he has to conquer all

The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know



[Chorus: Woman singing]

I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace

'Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason



I see people hating other people

Tell me what's the reason

When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'

What's the reason?

Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa



[Verse 3: Nas]

I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive

She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit

She called the cops 'cause she hated his mother

Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover

How many niggaz gon' die this summer?

I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder

There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer

It's odd, huh? 'Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife

He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night

Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz

in her pad while she slept

They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister

Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next



[Chorus: Woman singing]

I see people hating other people

Tell me what's the reason

That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money

What's the reason?

For these wars we're fighting with each other

Season after season

When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'

What's the reason?



Woman harmonizes as Nas talks:

""Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what

Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggaz with they

kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there

To all the niggaz that died tryin'a figure out what's what

Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah

Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what

we do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and

shit. Just man... man."""

Switch lanes in monster whips, ambience
Specially dressed, guess who? -- Nas, it's obvious

Clear liquors, y'all niggaz are s-e-x

Yes we get respectic, eclectic messages

Left our brains, grit into a female's estrogen

She feels electric, her breasts she's touchin' them

Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction

N-a-s, then they ass, over-spank it

Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas

Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull'

Before I get either I need some Red Bull

She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool

When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool

That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing

Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't fuck with just anything

Gotta come up, run up and get touched up

Suicide, that's if you confront us

Love to rock diamonds and fancy rings

I'm a thoroughbred, real heavy mayn

I'm fuckin' something tonight that's on everything

Fellas who beat bodies with me

Kidnappers and stick-up kids, they all poli' with me

Pop bottles with me, button-up shirts and throwbacks

Old cats only roll when I'm in the city

And the dance floor it's disgustin'

Move your waistline to the basic percussion

I'm that, cool laid-back don who won't say nuttin'

And laugh when a nigga start frontin'

Rock Tims, rock Chucks, rock Bapes

Her light eyes, pretty lips, fly face

First you said you would spread for me in an instant

See me with the next chick, now you act different

Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her

Play your position, you way outta character

Do the knowledge, graduated hood college with honors

Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse

On the eyes shades in the nighttime regardless

The army's so thick you can't harm us

Ay fellas
I think you might wanna s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put your petroleum jelly on your face
Yo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets

that you knock they ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round

GET 'EM!



[Verse One: Nas]

Sittin up drunk, shufflin thoughts

Got paper but I'm lost

Losin focus what a nigga still hustlin for

My seed is straight, the fam is settled

Idle time get the man in trouble

When wifey tourin, my life get boring

Start to remember all types of torment

The devil's callin, but I don't answer

Mom passed from cancer, leavin behind

two granddaughters, two grandsons, two 9's

next to me in the Phantom, who lyin?

Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin

Gotta, try to stay away from creeps

With they bullshit, tryin to put me back in the streets

War stories, funerals

where feds be layin from a dreadful slayin

Body viewing's at the wake

Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket

with his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky

Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci

I'm above the standard

But dude just Mar-salis than Branford

Thinkin you're too rich, they wanna gun ya

Kidnap ya cause of they hunger, but you fuckin with hunters

Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips

Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit

Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips

Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit

Fight, fists, dance, suckah

Suicide, bounce, brother

Ice, whips, cash, nigga

Watch yo', big, ass, momma

To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous

Y'all the antithesis, the opposite

Twitchin shit, all up in your body language

Mean muggin your bitch, cause she leans over

to look closer told you y'all sloppy gangsters sayin

""Nas is this and Nas is that""

Your eyes go front, your eyes go back

Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at

It's obvious you don't know how I react

Like, I don't know where the party's at

You're foamin at the mouth, losin breath

Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed

Cause the fact is, y'all don't really want it

Two to the head, fo' to the stomach

Call more security cause I come off

anywhere you at you scary cats

If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain

a thousand times harder than when I first came

Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb

And y'all just forgot about the consequences

Not a jail sentence, but see

the nigga you feed'll kick it to dude that kick it to me

We posess, the recipes for death, cause jealousy destroys

Feed the dog first, watch out for salmonella poisoning

I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food

And say, ""That's the way you kill a man, avoid the shooting""

Hey...



[Chorus]



[Outro]

You smile, in my face

Secretly I know, you want my place

You waitin on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe

You wanna come cut my throat, you wanna get rid of me

But before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin

And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe

Before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin

And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
Look around it might hit you

No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you

Shit comes around faster than you think

Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?

Become a creature of habitat, the average cat

Won't see where it's at, or where it's going

The hood waits for no one

I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings

Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations

From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration

Imagination is what they lack

It stops niggaz from getting stacks

feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks

Wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple

""Starring out, a young disciple"" (Nas Sample)

Moonstruck stuck, slow as molasses in my actions

That's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life

In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin Tyson

after watchin him cut up Razor Ruddock

In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture

Lookin back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts

Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggaz they can have it

Coke baggin and toe-taggin

They took Will, let me describe him, a live one

I think that he was the true +God's Son+ - not Jesus, but fearless

His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin

not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you""

He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered

But wild with them hammers, niggaz frontin couldn't stand it

Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2

With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking

Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen

Captain Hook to these infants

It's like my folks is still on the benches

Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention

1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval

Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid

Rhyming to music all this time

Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it

Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave

From the block, where the world was forever freezing

Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again

Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them

Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats

Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope

He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke

Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies

Babies born in a cycle, future disciples

Long as the butt bubble in back of your waistline

I don't waste time, I gotta get-get on it

?What's that??

?Totally With It. T.W.I? 

?Ha, well here I am?

?Yep, I'm the man?

?Bartender, put a Cosmo in that girl hand?

Now I was so fresh and so fly in diamonds

When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shinin, ?bling!?

A little cute thing said, ?What's your name??

I put my necklace in her face and told her ?Read the chain?

Ooh, ooh so stuck up

Told me ?Shut the fuck up?

Blow! Ludacris is in the hot Luke house

The needle hit the record, they was playin this song

All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh on

Live forever like 'Fame', let the Leroys dance 

While I'm laid back chillin in my b-boy stance 

Could be a little pop lockin if your girl's tops droppin 

But watch for cock blockin all my coochie stock options 

But later for that ASDAQ throw 'em on the fast track 

Make 'em swip-swap Nasty N.A.S pass that 

Honey in the black cuz I'm feelin her curves 

She looked down and what I had is that wa-wa word 

Why only serve one when you can serve up two

Then at the bachelor's pad doin what the Virgos do 

And these women so shy, but get loud undercover

So we can have sex, but I can't be your lover! 

Sing

I think I can remember some

Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her

Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker

Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick

Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement

Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her

Put hickeys on her stomach

Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch a screw

Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume

That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude

Used to put my face in her crotch

Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched

Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer

While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my urethra

While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker



[Chorus]

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few

Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you



[Nas]

Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes

Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction

Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection

Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log

Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind

Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious want to cuff us when fucked us

Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher

Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa

The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong

Under the coat and

Put a show on just to show me she loved me

She would undress and wait in zero below weather

In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive

Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'

Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin

Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it

Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets

Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters

Long chin, some with funny odors

Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese

Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease

And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool

And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww

Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas

Principles are lined up, things prioritized

Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown

It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer

Are we tempted

used to put my face in her crotch

Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched

Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer

While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha

While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker



[Chorus]

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few

Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you



[Nas]

Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes

Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction

Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection

Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log

Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind

Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us

Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher

Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa

The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong

Under the coat and

Put a show on just to show me she loved me

She would undress and wait in zero below weather

In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive

Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high



[Chorus]

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few

Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you



[Nas]

Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'

Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin

Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it

Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets

Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters

Long chin, some with funny odors

Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese

Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease

And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool

And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww

Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas

Principles are lined up, things prioritized

Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown

It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer

are we tempted



[Chorus]

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few

(now we could properly begin this)

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few

Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you"

I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?

The makings of a perfect bitch



[Nas]

A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife

I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper

Mad niggaz in this one predicament

You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it

My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'

Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing

So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man

A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand

And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her

I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker

I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League

Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee

What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef

Say goodbye to the stress



[Chorus]



[Nas]

I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever

These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better

Four cycles of blood, child birth first

Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death

That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth

Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef

Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh

Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess

If she survives she'll be sucking me next

Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do

my taxes for the IRS

So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed

I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god

Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart

Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death

I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets

Like Billie Holiday in Harlem

Body from Ketoi Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms

Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan

Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit

Helping me load clips

Some words form a pimp was, ""Nas, it just don't exist""

But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses

All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect

But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie

Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt

Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigolo
It was difficult for me to find a chick I want
[Nas]
This ain't no sucka for love shit

This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hug shit, first night we fuck shit

And don't call the next day, this a thug's wedding day

And love, will we make it? Let us pray...

In a limo, my niggas, my father, my brothers

Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted

Hard Bottasmov costumes, this ain't no act, though

Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more

Yes, I'm absolutely sure

I know that she love me, I know that she faithful

We spoke on a prenuptial agreement cuz Will and Jada ain't need it

Spoke on eloping but then I deaded the thought

Cuz she deserves Cinderella's Ball and the whole shit

But know this, you fuckin' wit a slit ya throat quick

Behicular explosions, cigar smokin'

Dark-minded, chart climbin, well-spoken

Safer world of broke men to rich ones

Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it, hun

Headed to the Chapel, my niggas laughin

And it's bafflin cuz just a year ago

It's weird, though, I knew I'd get married

To who? I knew not, thought of snatchin Halle up from the dreadlock

Pumpin' Sade, my head knot

Finally, I met the perfect bitch, pardon my french, rephrase that 

Someone who made my heart stop, couldn't wait to blaze that

Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey

HIV spreadin', everybody bump the same bunnies

The game'll put niggas in they graves right before they part ways with the street

I want a son to greet every mornin'

Daughters and more sons tickle my feet

Wife smilin', tellin' me it's time to eat

I'm gettin' married



[Chorus x3]



[Nas]

It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on the ride

Even Marrin Luther King had a fling on the side

That's what the negative ones say

Knew my wedding would be one day but quickly is this day

I know the hoes gonna miss me

Lookin' at old photos, sayin, ""Damn, used to twist me""

Start chokin' up since I woke up

Bachelor Party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up

Father saw me in a daze, knudged me with his left arm

Told me how him and moms went to City Hall, dressed norm'

Said she would love me and my eyes were boating

Customized in London by guys who suit up kings

Gov', you got the ring, Jung', you behave

Maxwell, he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang

Baltimore, North Cacky', Mississippi

Family packed in, my nigga, L is crazy tipsy

Spilled Pepsi on the cufflinks, ginger ale got it out

Watched in the church, just all big to thug it out

My girl walked in glistenin', different stones

'Bout to go from my fiance to Mrs. Jones

That's a union nobody can touch

I gotta be cool wit' ya crazy aunts and uncles

Cuz I love you much...cuz you put up wit my shit

Court cases, baby mommas

I make an honest woman outta you yet

Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter, standin'

Heart poundin' out my chest like a cannon

I'm happy, one of my Groom's men

Under the music says, ""Don't do it""

But they just joke, some crew shit

They playin, I'm gleeful, I'm stayin'

I'm sayin' vows that are all true

""Will you take music as your wedded wife?""

""I do.""

Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin' to



Gettin' married

See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas

I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive



Let's go!... Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey 

Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered

Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it

But I'm still number one, everyday real

Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel

'Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss

Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi

Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy

Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap

The history of music on this track

Born in the game, discovered my father's music 

Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain

But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids

Some are well-known, some doin' bids

I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks

If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

[Olu Dara singing]

Greatest man alive (Nas: Yeah, turn it up!)

Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!



The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues

Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's

Old school, new school, know school rules

All these years I been voicin' my blues

I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart

Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent

But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with

Books to read, like X and stuff

'Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia

In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of

Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up

'Cause none'a them would like my style

Read more books than the curriculum profile

Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child

'Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""



Greatest man alive (Nas: Yeah, turn it up!)

Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!



Hey-Hey-Hey My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone

He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home

Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu

Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to



I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique

Madagascar, Paris, Greece

The Middle Africa is where we lived

Better known as Queenbridge



Nas, Nas you don't stop

Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop

Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop

From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop

Tell 'em Pop 



See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)

I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)

Ended up in New York City (Yeah!)

Where I had my first child (That's me)

I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)

All the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy)

I told him as a youngster

He'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)

Greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)

Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' alright
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown

And I know it's not my time to go now

'Cause God's got my back in this showdown

So I know we'll be alright



[Nas]

Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth is holdin' those

Briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks

Silver fo'-fo', got no,

My chauffer driver just left some of my colleagues smokin' that Cali

Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window

Kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little

Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica

Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her

And I'm late to a dite with my wife, I realize

I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise

And I'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me

But God got me, no fear, through the fire pride stop 



[Chorus - singing]

There's a war in the streets tonight

And all this drama's got me feelin' uptight

I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo

'Cause she's standin' on the corner of Linden Boulevard

Holding our baby in her baby in her arms

So hold on, your daddy's in sight



[Nas]

Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes

For the first time, praise God, baby mom's cryin'

Planned to be a strong black family

But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin'

New come, I caught verbal assassin runnin' with

Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight

But we brought my baby home the first night

Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib

Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment

Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash

Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass

Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""

I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi

Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine

She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again

Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers,

Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems

New woman, she's great, this a different world,

Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl

It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy

I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me



[Chorus - singing]

There's a war in the streets tonight

And nobody's really feelin' alright

I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic

I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down

And I know it's not my time to go now

And I mightta miss your graduation

And no matter how many miles I'm away from you

Hear daddy on every station

Thinking, I'm loving my occupation

One, two

One, two, who got more style, the son do

Check, one, two



[Verse 1]

Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit

On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot

Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggaz

Little kids scared cops, wit red dots

Philosophical gangsta, wit violent priors

Goin back like black and white TV's wit pliers

Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires

Flash iron, anybody tryin on, the blocks I'm supplyin on

Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up

And swallow 'em and the P now got goons, lots of 'em

Cops see them and run, don't want no drama

Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of

Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota

Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace

He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians

From Kingston, who drink Irish Malts

Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh

Lightning hits the top of the church steeple

When I'm writin, semi-automatic no hyphen

It's frightening.... {*scratches*}



[Chorus]

The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right

Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit

The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right

Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit

The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right

Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit

The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right

Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit



[Verse 2]

I take summers off, cause I love winter beef

Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheep

Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill

Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd

Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth

Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains

Smellin like trees, sensimille on the brain

Skeemin on ya girls, bambooze or ya chain

Got ill up on the train, twistin off a cap

Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks

Deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises

Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys, it's

.... Just another day in the hood

And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good

We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em

But our style was let them pile then, we robbin 'em

Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes

Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin

And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life

For the thief's who come out at night



[Chorus]

And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starving
Pushing cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities

Worldwide on the thorough side of things

Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time

One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat

40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me

""What you up to, the cops gon' bust you""

I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered

If God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block

And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched

I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair

Staring at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do

Yeah man, throwing them bones

Hoping my ace get his case thrown

His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoeing

While he looking at centerfolds of pretty girls

Showing they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's living proof

The D.A. who tried him was lying

A white dude, killed his mother during the case

Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced

Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier

Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild

Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle

I want to crack a smile when I see him

Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom

He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezing

Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, nobody leaving everybody



Some niggas fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em

Weird-ass niggas are dangerous, so don't test 'em

They make you, disappear, this a year that I won't forget

Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs

Southern niggas, independent label, real killers

Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chilling

They had the coke game something crazy

Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me

Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or something

Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them

Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me

I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy

Now I'm back around the old school that raised me

New York gangstas, we lounging, out in L.A. see

A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay

The letter say, ""Nas I got your back, the fools don't play""

I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral

Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible

The nigga still alive in a hospital

Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too

See my cousin's in the game, thugging and things

He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano

Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano

She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile

Should of never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed

Opening the hotel room do', to let her goons in

But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit

I let the hammers blow, wet three kids

See honey thought I had something to do, with all the drama

Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed

Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fucking with you

He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers



All I really gotta say is that

If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?

How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?

A shame when you ain't look at it

My folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk

Somebody gotta make a change"

For you rappers, I carry the cross

There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to

Noisy I aim not silently, noose all surroundin me

I hang 'em I string 'em up ain't no thing I just drop 'em

to which doctor you copped and you locked and it ain't what it was

I changed it up from that pop shit it's hard to see R&B

rappers arguably, started fuckin up the game horribly

Cause, I parted the sea, then these novices targetted me

Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin to me

What I've discovered is my brother's tryin to be

the next me, yeah I support him but he's blinded I see

jealousy he love me to death am I buggin I love him for life

We both still mournin on our mother's, life

And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck

A six, a truck, some guns to bust

I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass

with the Nasty Nas, diary, get out my path



[Chorus]



[Nas]

I can't keep a bitch cause none of them come up for a little less

I can't be too rich, too many hoes, lined up for sex

I can't rest until my niggaz in houses with pretty maids

Water and flowers in 'em

While my niggaz walk around in they trousers grinnin

Gotta keep a lot of heat; 30 cals 10 millimeters

40 cals plus the heckler, to set y'all straight

You too light? I shoot your freckles out

You too dark? The infrared show you what the tec about

Huh? I'm stressin out, need more offices for bosses

Secretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy

We can sell mo', boats on the coast

Give, coats to the po' and give, hope to the broke then live low

But that ain't reality, I look happy but under the sky

You see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3

will love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil

BITCH! You the reason niggaz be beefin, hoe get on

'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on

From here on, it's a new day

Million dollars ain't, what it was yesterday

Many problems, many niggaz, most involved but they fake

Hope y'all relate

Only describe us as soldier survivors

Stay laced in the best, well dressed with finesse

In a white tee lookin' for wifey

Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze

We can drive through the city no doubt

But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out

No reason for your mans to panic

You don't want to see no ambulances

Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup

That's the way you get Timberland'd up

Let the music diffuse all the tension

Baller convention, free admission

Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift

Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept

All my just comin' homeys, parolees

Get money, leave the beef alone slowly

Get out my face, you people so phoney

Pull out my waist, the eagle fo-forty

I lay you out, show you what steel do

Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges

Every invitation to fight you punk hazas

Like Pun said, ""You ain't even en mi clasa!""

Maybach Benz, back seat, T.V. plasma

Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers

Whatever you choose, whatever you do

Make sure he a thug and intelligent too

Like a real thoroughbred is, show me love

Lemme feel how the head is

Females whose the sexiest is always the nastiest



And I like a little sassiness, a lotta class

[Nas]

Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars

Who you thought 'Kick In The Door' was for?

But that's my heart, y'all still trippin of this Jigga shit

Real niggaz listen up and I'ma tell you how the whole thing start

Off top I brung Queens up from hard times

Rockin at the Fever, streets was all mine

It was my version of the blues, droppin our schools

The crack epidemic had rap representin new rules

So I, got in 'em shoes, tried 'em wore them

Wasn't a perfect fit, so I couldn't sport em

Young murderers ride, I knew all them

Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warring

I wrote it in my album

I was 18 when Lake seen the Island

And Lord held me down and

My surroundings started changing

I had a baby, I was making my rounds with AZ

Niggaz started noticing my flow and was open when

The Golden Child closed 'em in with more style than them older men

Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang

Snoop and Dre had a new thang

So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects

He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit

BIG and I hit blunts performing at the Arc

Next thing you knew, BIG blew and all the balling starts

He had Kim and his crew, I found Fox

Only niggaz in New York with number one charts

B.I.G. was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon my niggaz

But dig it, they couldn't get along

That's when Ghostface said it on the Purple tape

Bad Boy biting Nas album cover way(?)

BIG told me Rae was stealing my slang

And Rae told me out in Shaolin BIG would do the same thing

But I borrowed from both them niggaz

Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with 'Ain't No Niggaz'

Had much Versace swagger

B.I.G. admired the Brooklyn knight and it took him in as Iceberg the rapper

Today don't know nothing, about this bullshit

There's more shit than wanting to be this King of New York shit



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Rap became a version of Malcom and Martin

Rest In Peace Will, Queensbridge live on

There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song

There's some missing pieces I had to leave out

I had lot trust for Steve Stoute

At some point till I got to know him

We old friends, but what's loyal?

Puff soaked Interscope offices

With champagne bottles on Steve, and Steve thought the drama is on me

Cause previously it would have been, against whoever

Friends forever

However, I learn, with some niggaz it's all business

But I'm a street dude with morals

To diss niggaz with Jigga too much, he used to say Jay wanted my spot

I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot

A quiet man who used to be alone planning

Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it

She hit the streets, later on she hittin the sheets

With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinking he strong

I taught her how to watch for cars that might follow

Tauht her street shit that I know

Her weakness was shine yo

But that's her, I ain't mad baby, it made me stronger

Now I get my paper longer

Illmatic I was boss

It Was Written I flossed

One of the most creative LPs ever to hit stores

In the Firm I learned I am Nastradamus

QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems

I gave it all up so I can chill at home with mama

She was getting old and sick so I stayed beside her

We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs

I told her not till I see her health get more strong

In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack

Assasinate my character, degrade my hood

Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go

The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood

What you want, see, I already had

The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first shall be last

I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper

G-O-D S-O-N, they'll be none after

I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo

It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo..



Uhh, uhh, uhh

Way too foul walk around all the time

With a gray Mack 10 and a pocket full o' dimes

Scared straight, but FUCK them hos

Town house niggas

I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries

Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired

While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up

A million of us, each nigga inchin' a bus

You got a house in Virginia

The only way you sicker than us

Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck

No need for the gun play, it's ok, 'cause you dyin' anyway



Yo, this is for them High school drop outs

Niggas who copped out

If you prefer shots over knockouts

Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed

Sellin' crack, sellin' smack

You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back

Braveheart's gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end

Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend

I used to have a bike on a bench

Now I got a jeep on this trip

Coke in the pot, heat on my head



Nigga dont stop blazin' cuz ya target's movin'

Shoot 'till the gun's empty stupid, Queens

Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is

Useless to these swift executioners

And thats Queensbridge nigga, all day

Latifah's chest jingle in ""Set It Off""
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times

Answer while I'm puffin' my green

It's Tamika sayin', ""Hi Nas""

I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that

She offered me dinner under the moon

I said, ""Sorry. I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room""

Nine push-ups... Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up

The pimp's gone off the Platron Tequila

Put on my Lee's and the original Fila's

Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tails

Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose

Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go

Here's the issue... A woman gotta be stunnin'

Get to a man's heart through his stomach

You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts

Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark

Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart

If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok

If you want barbeque I call Professor and Ock

Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me

That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there

Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years

Like noone else in the world did this except for us two

You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you

You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you

You can be anything in the world, in God we trust

An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 

But nothing comes easy it takes much practice

Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star

She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe

Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version

Hung with the wrong person

Gotta astrung when I heard when 

Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose

Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old

No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath

Cause she smells of corrosion and death 

Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring

Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing

So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how

You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey

Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 

Older than you are, give yourself time to grow

You thinking he can give you wealth, but so

Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know

You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice

You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right

Begging different women for a place to sleep at night

Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish

If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this



I know I can (I know I can)

Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 

We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys

It was empires in Africa called Kush 

Timbuktu, where every race came to get books

To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans

Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 

Gold was converted to money it all changed 

Money then became empowerment for Europeans

The Persian military invaded 

They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred

Africa was almost robbed naked

Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 

Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 

He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces

Shot up they nose to impose what basically 

Still goes on today, you see? 

If the truth is told, the youth can grow 

They learn to survive until they gain control 

Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes

Read more learn more, change the globe

Ghetto children, do your thing

Hold your head up, little man, you're a king

Young Prince thats when you get your wedding ring

Your man is saying ""She's my queen""



I know I can (I know I can)

(I wonder when I wrote this. Nah it's weak)

The money's ya religion sky the limit live life

Numbers is big business makes the poor live trife

The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream

Through your existence become wealthy knowledge is king

Pimps and card sharks thiefs murderers with hard luck

Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society

Cops that shoot blacks is routine for noteriety

Grow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms

Beautiful ladies on their arms

Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas

Rubbin my lips with Campophenique

Still behind the ears wet turned out to be

Pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and liers and squares...

(Nah that was weak there)

My people be projects or jail never Harvard or Yale

Pardon me type in my 2way while I'm chargin' my cell

It's hard to be iced up with Gucci god poverty's real

I can't fight you cause you would sue me niggas be groupies

I see imitators tryin' to make albums spittin' my style

And they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit

I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie

My nina lean on me like Swoop it's crap this can't be

My book of rhymes



This can't be my book of rhymes writing this bullshit!

(My Book of Rhymes)

Nah neva that fuck that, aw why you laughin' Alchemist?

Huh you a funny nigga... naw yeah

(My Book of Rhymes)

I'm tellin' you I'ma come up with some new shit now

Fuck that I'ma write again now fuck that

I musta been high on some shit mmm what the fuck is this?



Look how we treat pregnancy women in the 'hood

Our values so low our values are no good

Things our mothers told us we shoulda heeded

Cause now we need it

We older almost able t...

I'm jealous of you how come you so beautiful?

Smelling fresh youthful intelligent while I'm stressin' and shit

Aiyo I envy you 'cause all you do is smile and things come your way

Such a innocent child is what some say

I get upset 'cause I just want to be treated the way you are

Like a star not a worry in this world thus far

But wait a minute we both need ya mother's attention

I must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant

I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey
The best journey

Acres of land and swimming pools and all that

Check it out



[Verson One: Nas]

I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings

To fly like does over the streets watchin' many things

Kids walkin' home from school on drug block missionaries

Pass out papers that read: Love God

See faces, cases, judges, juries, masons, lawyers and cops

I watch because every thugs face is my mirror

But this was one in particular 

This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro

16 years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go

Every mornin calls his comrad to come and get him to smoke

He insane, already gone mad

Blames himself for his setbacks

Dangerous street corners where his sets at

Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs

Chasin' him, his ass was flarin'

Smokin' like a chimney, on really, of course he not carin'

He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'

I give him a helpin' hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion



[Chorus: J. Phoenix]

Every corner, every city

There's a place where life's a little busy

Little Hennessy, laid back and cool

Every hour, cause it's all good

Leave all the stress from the world outside

Every wrong done will be alright 

Nothin but peace, love 

And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion



[Verse Two: 2Pac]

Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good

Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods

Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook

Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke

Then some lady named Billie Holiday

Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came

Little LaTasha sho' grown

Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home

Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us

When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band

Just think of all the people that you knew in the past

that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last

Picture a place that they exist, together

There has to be a place better than this, in heaven

So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin

Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion



[Chorus]



[Verse Three: Nas]

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide

Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by

No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets

No reason, for nobody's momma to cry

See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter

But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her

This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me

Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe

Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin

I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother

And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy

I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur

Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war

And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more

Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavnly champagne

What angels saw, with golden wings in thug's mansion



[Chorus]"

A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered

A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy

A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book

A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical



[Nas]

Velvet bowties, bulletproofs in the tux, when I roll by

In car similar to a suanas, in my diamonds

And my principal is to study drama

Look what happened in Manhattan

A couple of years ago when guns started clappin'

Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggaz ran

They was amatures in beef with a grown man

It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand

And how the weak, end up in a coffin

Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man

Keep your ears to the street, y'all never lose man

Make your enemies believe there's love there

Cause in war, belief is all fair

Rock them to sleep, shots in your jeep

And you ain't never know the plot was from me

It's from my Masterminds



[Chorus]

A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes

A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one

A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered

A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy

A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical



[Nas]

It ain't a game it's the life

Think it's a game, you layin

And I'm nice on that black stone merlo

Toast to my hero Nat Turner

Whether below zero, gave the keys to Kelis

Whispered in her earlobe, drive on

Cause she the wife and they the freaks

The underneath my girl caliber

They smiled at her and said ""Goodbye"" 

With niggaz who thug or die, they wild as us

My bodyguards are my Denali trucks

Knownin' that I'm surrounded by OG's that I don't really get down with



They got a seperate table for their freaks bought them drinks

So we could talk man-to-man so real niggaz could link

I knew, they kill hos too like Rae Carruth

They used to spray troops, now they managing groups

The main nigga sunny had big money since '82

Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do

That was back when I had no crew, I switch that

Now I'm strong with niggaz who felt Sonny was wrong

My money's long his money is weak, he's losing sleep

Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gonna be

But I'm a Mastermind 



[Chorus]

A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes

A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one

A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered

A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy

A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book

A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical



[Nas]

I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable

I speak for myself, my niggaz will slay you

Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine

FEDs, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find

This King Of New York shit only last 15 minutes

Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it

Niggas who brillant, came in and killed it

Made millions ever three months, new jury

I'm low, smoking blueberry, with a ho 

Who know a few scary individuals eerie as she gets into it

Squares they into voodoo

She says a Hail Mary and she says she knew who

Would come and try to kill you too 



[Chorus]

A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes

A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one

A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered

A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy

A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book

A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical"

Uh, If I can teach somethin' so dear
And hope somebody learn somethin' from it
And give it back
[Verse1]

They can't break me or shake me

They too fake to come kill me

Think they faith this was satan

They mistake me I'm filthy

Rich off the ghetto madness, so now they wanna dare me

It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty

Middle Passage I made it I'm from the land of David

The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets

That bunch of backward gangsters

That sign of Alpha Davis

Snitches with smile-like faces got you blowin' trial I hear this

Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy

I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried

Kind o' waitin' is scary

All my years have prepared me

What I fear is my temper, I subject to the center

Right through a man's soul

Straight through his eyes, straight through his heart I'm still alive how did I make it this far

'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go

Every single night I pray

And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found

I guess it's just a warrior's way 



[Chorus (1): Alicia Keys]

This is the song, for my warriors

A warrior song Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior

Definition of a warrior

Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum 



[Verse2]

Like King Nasir fightin' the

British regime I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost in their world

Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket

Your mother's the closest thing to

God that you ever have kid I'm askin, what would you do at your own mom's funeral

Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real

Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but

I can't keep still I can't go on, responsible for so many

Her last days at the hospital

Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas

Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy

She raised me in the projects alone

Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body

Got me ready to embody somethin' quickly

Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me

So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls

To the kids with no parents at home, grab a whole 



[Chorus (2): Alicia Keys]

This is the song, for my warriors

A warrior song

Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior

(Uh, warriors)

Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum 



[Verse3]

Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see

When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies

I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful If you was me

all this pain I'm feelin would bend and killed you

(I'm a Warrior)

It only made me stronger

But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya

Sometimes I wish I was dead

But I took heed to the cause

(I'm a Warrior, yeah)

'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go

Every single night I pray

And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found I guess it's just a warrior's way 



[Chorus x3 (1) Until End: Alicia Keys]



[Nas]

To my warriors

To all these, baby Krucial

Keys! Braveheart y'all

This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion

To everybody that lost their mother, their father

Rest in peace moms!

My mother's last words:

Never give up

A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war

Love ya girl, y'kno keep marchin'

Yea yea yea, you never give up

To all my warriors, haha

Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause

I gotta take you off here

Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause

I gotta take you off here



[Nas]

Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques

Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness, in all them

Gotta shoot only if necessary 

Homey vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal

Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time

Where Arian nations ain't having integration, we so blind

The beauty of life, was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ

I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right, ""Jesus""!

What is he like? I picture him standing with diamonds on him

Little different from the way my mommy saw him

Practice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and

Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging

Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school 

Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Ghandi was a fool

But chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, fuck it

Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out 



[Chorus]



[Lake]

My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build

With dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills

for fish scale, to cop guns, the time come

I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus

Fuck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese 

And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's 

Black fatigues and ? on the sofa

50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters

My motions don't appeal to repel at divisions

I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system

I'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga

Only killas know my face

I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake

Though simultaneously the street revolution 

21 gun salute the new Huey Newton 



[Chorus]



[Nas, Lake]

[N] Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to his fathers

[N] Protect the children, grab revolvers

[N] The women plays important part of our life force

[N] So what we fight for, my heart goes to you beautiful wife in war

[L] Uh, And listen more talk less

[L] Watch all and trust none, demand your respect

[L] And be ready to die for what you believe in

[L] And ride all the time not just when convenient 

[N] Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding

[N] We the lost children of Israel in this western world region

[N] You ain't a man you a coward if you cant support the girl you put a seed in

[L] Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong

One more time, one more time
Huh, one more time, huh
One more time
I dream of the day I could go back to when I was born

Laying in your arms, wishing you was here today mom

Wish you would appear

Just for a second from heaven my tears would be gone

I wouldn't be rapping this song

I'd be happy driving up to your 8 bed room mansion

Ablade, laughing bout the hard time we faced

The galaxy is so enchanting beyond, Galileo's understanding

Past the milky way and all the planets

There's something out there greater

But only god knows, scientist claim we came from apes

But they lies though, that was part of our conversation

I spark one up a star blazing

Thinking of how amazing she was

A angel gave me love

I'm thankful, to ever know a women so real

I pray when I marry my wife'll have one of your skillz

But mom you could never be replaced

I'd give my life up

Just to see you one more day

To have...



[Chorus]

One more dance with you mama

If I could only have

One more dance with you mama

Praying, wish that I could have

One more dance with you mama

If I could only have

One more dance with you mama



I wish you were here,

I miss you more each second I breathe

You resting in peace forever I accepted you free

A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white

Smiling at me, happy knowing everything's all right

If only I could hear your voice and your laughter

Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine

April 7, oh-two

That's when the gates of heaven opened up for you to stroll through

Beautiful Anne Jones

Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood

You was my strength to carry on and now I'm good

Job well done, you lived threw you sons and your grandchildren

Jesus finally got his bridge, mommy dance with him

And you've been my guide threw all the trouble I faced

They playing our song the lifebeat my hand on your waist

I grab your other hand and try not to step on your toes

Spin you around with my eyes closed

Dreaming I could have



[Chorus]



I love you forever mom

You will always live threw me ... always

Huh, huh huh, yea"

Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Or save it all for you?

Would I, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a FLASH

Before reconsidering, this Hell with you

It ain't you it's the things you do (do)

It's tearing my heart in two

I would of fell with you

To Hell with you

If Heaven was a mile away

And you could ride by the gates

Would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?

Would you pray louder finally believing His power?

Even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?

How would you start acting?

Would you try to put the keys down?

Thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets He can see now

Would a fiend even want to get high, would he stop smoking?

If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in

To get away and escape from the craziness

And I bet you there's a Heaven for an atheist

It's hard taking this

Racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff

Even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherfucking hands up

Thinking I'm a lose it

My mom's in chemo

Three times a week, yo keep trying but people

Is hard and God your young soldier's not so bold

But needs you

This world's my home but world I would leave

Nigga what you think I'ma stop building

I'ma stop feeling like I'm Amistad's great great grandchildren

How I'm not gonna want to make millions

Since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke

Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day

But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch

Game time to them cats never looked back Cristal blowing dub sacks

That's when it all just hit me

You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me

I'd give it all away quickly

Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so

not to be recognized forgive me

It's becoming unbearable 

Making hits is easy

Put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum CD

I know you heard the noise

Preachers touching on altar boys

Sodomizing not realizing God is watching before the Lord

How can they do the devil's work?

A man giving another man head in church

Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that I fled the Earth.

Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants
Yeah X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicide and feds on the blocks where I played, be-ball

That's when I wondered was I here for the cause, or be-cause

Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto

Was told to stay strong and I could beat the Devil

Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats

Watching niggas swing razors in the front row, then out in the streets

The car show, 560's, chemical Afros

Acuras pumping Super Lover Cee and Casanova

Live chicks be, asses busting out of they clothes

Wearing lip gloss, big door knockers pealing they earlobes

So where them years go? Where the old gold beers and cheers go?

But now them shorties here doe, so

The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs

Riker's Island busting, still packed, what's the word?

The drinkers stay drinking, or puffin they herb

And I'm, still enjoying life's ride; one mo' time

The drinkers stay drinking, or puffin they herb

And I'm, still enjoying life's ride; right?

Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers

In army boots, yelling ""Join the armed forces!""

We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons

Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes

There's still a lot of naked crawling in the carpet offices

War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us

They won't be serving the beast too long

The murderers wearing police uniforms, confederate flags I burn

Beat Street breakers were dancing to the music I chose

And Peachtree Atlantic crackheads was tootin they nose

In frozen corners of Chicago, loaded up Llama's children

With fo'-fo's, and double-revolvers

We devil incarnates, headed for jail

Where Shell gas company in South Africa be having us killed

Your paper money was the death of Christ

And all these shorties coming up just resurrect your life

It's like a cycle

Niggas used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up

That's when we were lied to, buying hair products

Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegrating

'til awareness started penetrating

The styles come from prison, they used potatoes making liquor

Just to prove we some creative niggas

Turning nothing into something, is God work

And you get nothing without struggle and hard work

War is necessary to my niggas in chains

From Greene to Sing-Sing, I'm wanting y'all to know one thing

The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does

Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves

Take one step toward him, he takes two toward you

Even when all else fail, God support you

I done it, got God sun on my stomach

My heart and my lungs was affected from Henny's and getting blunted

Do your body right and it loves you back

You only get one life, and yo because of that

I'm still blazing, going out for the cause

Still rocking stocking caps, not for the waves, obeying no laws

And it's like that

I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose draws

A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss

Guns under beds, mask and a flashlight

Living my life like everyday's my last night

Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood

Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug

Mama told me from weed, I would switch drugs

To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs

How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack-on

Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms

Bopping to the supremes, smoking joints

I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps

I did it my way, from break dancing, back spins on the cardboard

I did it my way, to bullet proof bentleys, gats in the car's door

I did it my way, never gave a fuck what nobody said

They think its alot, the blink of an eye, you could get shot

Niggas is wolves, coming if you ruthless or not

But i be on point, put you in places where bodies rot

Never knew murder till I seen my man get popped

No blood soaking, laying there, eyes still open

I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm

He was looking right through me, Yo staring beyond

I wonder what he saw, the limoes, movies and tours

Did he die in vain and represent for the cause

Now I put his name on everything I'm involved

And that's the game, Ya'll can't relate, fuck ya'll (Ill Will)

I did it my way, from crumbs, roaches and rats

I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps

I did it my way, I call it how I see it niggas

I did it my way, if you don't like it so be it niggas

I did it my way, I make my own rules, I do my own plans

I did it my way, gangstas do what they want

Suckers do what they can't

I did it my way, taking sacrifices kid

I did it my way, but now you only getting one life to live

Yo, hoes in my fold can slow me, roll with the brokest homies

Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scolding my foes who phony

They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesil

Here on and blow it rurals, its mine, knew a crew one time

'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time

In just two years, their crew disappear

Snitches and bitches, smeared the paint on their pictures

Gave me splinters, just a baby nigga thankful

When them killers came through, guns out, moving

(It's what they want) Word (Its what they want)



[Nas]

Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep

Flow when I'm set, got the chips to a lotus my whip

Gold on my neck was once a code of respect

For high rollers and vets

Now it's loads of baguettes, prefer a mack-10 over a tech

No matter sober or wet, I smack soldiers, cadets

Trees that might eject my hype back

Famous phrase ""Nigga light that""

Hoes you fuck, ask you where your ice at, dunn

It's all about playboys, when we was young

Can only get tongue, then finally we can cum

Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's

Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro

From bottles, to seven in your hand

To fake pepsi's to get to the crack, unscrew the can

Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it

We got it if the fiends want it

The whole block singing the same theme ""Don it""

Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket

If its ice work, I'm gonna truck it

You gotta love it, you gotta love it



[Chorus]

(It's what they want) fuck it

(It's what they want) you gotta love it

(It's what they want) fuck it

(It's what they want) you gotta love it

(It's what they want) fuck it

(It's what they want) you gotta love it

(It's what they want) (it's what they want) (it's what they want)



[Nas]

Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist

Get pulsive with malice insentitives, the foulest of bitches

Hung up my riches, her childest wishes

Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes

Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough

Kicking this flow, slip in a new fo'

So when your click roll, I let my clips go, Niggas on opposite polls

I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole

Inhuman, living hostile opposed

To living on the streets, proper from my top to my toes

Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor

Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas

See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference

Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens

You can't be a kingpin when you snitching

Regardless, we still make you a target

We shoot you and chill, chrome objects

Hit you in your projects, its street anomics

This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics

Miserable cats, hunger painting

Get off your ass, stop complaining

My crew be in Montego Bay margariting 

While you home, waiting your arraignment

This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment 

Now back in the hood, certain cats they wanna kill me

They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me

You gotta love it, you gotta love it



[Chorus]

(It's what they want) fuck it

(It's what they want) you gotta love it

(It's what they want) fuck it

(It's what they want) you gotta love it

(It's what they want) (it's what they want) (it's what they want)"

But, yo if you got a plan, believe me you gon' get there
You gon' get everything you ever wanted baby
That's my word
Trust, my niggas come home from long bids

They check for me before they see their own kids

I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tour in

major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers

Cop Ferraris with navigational screens

guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens

Piped out seats, Oakwood mb cord speakers

Bumpin' out old shit

That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a le tigre short sleeves

Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up

from Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt

100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts

Back then, nobody wore a vest

Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test

Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin'

Look at the chain I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand

Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'

Half of the crew probably on the island

Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger

Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought

Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife

for steppin' on the next man's nikes my motto look for tomorrow

Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way

Gats spray these shorties is killers

The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller

And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in

Like 'who's you' when I cruise through

I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends

be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever



Everything will eventually come to an end

So try to savor the moment, cuz time flies don't it

The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better

Cuz nothin' lasts forever



Everything will eventually come to an end

So try to savor the moment, cuz time flies don't it

The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better

Cuz nothin' lasts forever



Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'

Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'

Gucci iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs

One for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs

Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2

Pool parties beautiful view

You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style

Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile

Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses

Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'

Thinkin' damn wish my niggas could afford this

On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless

Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments

Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested

Worries of failure, when you buried will your familia

Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum

You should live, there's only one life that's the physical

Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable

Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'

Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion

The bitch you love could start to hate you, the shit you use to do escape you

Things that make you laugh represent the past

Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor

Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more

Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down

Turn 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town

Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still

Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real



Everything must eventually come to an end

So try to savor your moments, cuz time flies don't it

The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better

Cuz nothin' lasts forever, ya know



I said everything eventually comes to an end

So try to savor your moments, cuz time flies don't it

The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better

Cuz nothin' lasts forever

Ya know, ya now, nothin' lasts forever ya know let it go, let it go"

Left her husband, alone to raise they son hes in pampers.

Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree.

Went from 34B to 36 double D.

Met her in San Diego at the Super Bowl party.

Had the Heiny sipped it up, wit Terrell Davis.

MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated.

I was silked out, flossing with stout, he had the gators.

When she walked in, she lit up the room, like Las Vegas.

Terrell said our mans a full back for the Raiders.

A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers.

Its easy to get the pussy, just dont fall in love.

Next thing u know im hugged up wit this bitch in tha tub.

Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washin her feet.

Is this love? somebody's wife fuckin a thug.

Hitting it raw, tasting it, wildin out on my character, taping it.

Tyra Banks face is face lift, givin head like she knew me for years.

Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs.

Millions, she would get, if his neck got slit.

She rolled the equality, then passed the lye ta me.

Told me bout her mans life insurance policy.

He stays on the golf course, wears Drakkar Sport.

Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort.

You can take a man here goes the keys you can slip in the rear.

Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere.

So we can make more money, then you could ever see rapping.

Split the cash 'n, move to Venezuela, adaptin'

Caught him wit his Spanish maid, he had a liter wit a can of spray.

Burning her legs, she tied to the bed.

His maid cried no, lucky she was blind fold.

Naked wit, mad burn marks, all on her thighs yo.

Twelve point five million, he kept his funds in the Lloyd's of London.

Goes to his wife and his children.

Yo I thought, what if shorty gets scared, electric chairs all I vision.

All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision.

I'll switch the plan, then maybe fly to Switzerland.

Fake ID, forge his wife name, catch the next flight the same night.

Headed to Spain, nice game, now its back to where we meet again...



Blaze a 50

Sit back in a droptop Bezour Bentley.

Of course wit me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney.

Top down, nightmare, blow her hair

Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare.

Fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash.

Took a blast, out of her coke bag.

Snorted it, started screaming yo we almost crashed!

Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it wit crushed up glass.

Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep.

Overwhelmed by greed, put to death."

Light it up, uhh
[Nas]
The whole, city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers

Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it, it's just an intro

Hate it or love it, like it bump it or dump it

Writing, across the stomach spell GOD son

Life is like a jungle black it's like the habitat of Tarzan

Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine

Most of my niggaz packed in correctional facilities

Half of them passed on, mack strong, couple of shots

May the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin the block

Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin they place

A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that

Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible

A thug dies, another step inside his shoes

And they will hurt you, layin low with a bottle

I'm blowin circles, my state of mind purple



Light it, light it, uhh

Yeah.. light it up, light it up, uhh



Y'all just wanna deal with drama

Talk about niggaz who got things, y'all ready to kill his momma

Everything you went to is underworld related

You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred

You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin soldiers

to pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder

Think of how many dudes died tryin to be down with you

Everybody's under six feet of ground but you

Still standin, still roamin through the streets, that's real

You a survivor, knowin all the beef is ill

You got a bunch of thugs witchu even now that's ready

Trustin your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly

The hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day

A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away

That ain't love it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes

whose sons you killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?

Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God

Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars

Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holdin a mirror

Lookin down a tear in jail, makin weapons to kill ya

We smoke three tokes nigga pour more Henny

He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many

Cold-blooded murderers, universal

Hood to hood, blowin smoke, state of mind is purple



Light it up, light it up light it up, uhh

Light it up.. light it up, light it up, uhh

Uhh.. uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh



These hot-headed youngsters, always get into trouble

Reactin before thinkin, they easily irritated

And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin

when we should be climbin, in a nutshell, it's just jail

Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggaz rewindin

instead of movin forward, to blow up so what's the science?

People shoutin, police pushin the crowd

And on the ground's a young soldier, with meat hangin out him

Am I hallucinatin off the hazin?

Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in

It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots

Photograph pictures of, suspect faces

It's usually, two or three niggaz who innocent

But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch

A divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair

I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair

This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy

(?) Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me

This is how I escape the madness, too much of anything'll hurt you

So, my state of mind's all purple"

Where am I? Yo, it's ill
[Verse 1]
Yo my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me

Luckily I find 'em just at the right time

Mack in my right arm, Tequila bottle in 

My left arm like Cristian

Watching my life go, keeping myself in

Wolves in the night yo, hells men

Two revolvers I can let twelve spin

Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit

Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well 

Twisted blunts and inner conscience

Telling me that I aint shit

No matter how much cash I sit with

Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness

My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain

To replenish my adolescent brain

Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane

So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain

I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets

Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat

Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive

As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is

To maintain, bitches playin' games

Niggas snitchin', I aint saying names

But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang

Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed

I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash

Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me

Instead they speed ahead

Yo nigga watch me



[Chorus]

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat

I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef

I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to

Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to

Steering wheel in my hand

Trying to hold it steady

Anything in my way is dead

Cause that's the way I feel, I am already

When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone

Drunk by myself



[Verse 2]

Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once

Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts

For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves

Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well

Take them to hell

Stick up niggas once ran up on me

My deckited lifestyle attracted sharks on me

I aint your mark homey

It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake

Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes

Could hardly look both ways, put out the hayes blurry vision

Think about the time in my life before I was in televison

Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision

Since we all hood niggas expect kilos

For what they not seeing is police expect Rico

Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated

Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me

I hate it when I'm like this

The bottle's my accomplice



[Chorus]



[Verse 3]

The reason that I want to be alone 

Tired of all the things that went wrong 

That would have went right if I would have did it on my own

Take another swigg

The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts

Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down

Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through

Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true

Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately

Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, lost again

To keep my mind off that weak shit

There's love through it all, things to live for

I swerve, almost crash into a wall

Think about the good, find myself laughing

Turn the cell off, no way to be reached

Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets

Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home

Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip

Bring my ass to the crib

I'm tired...

Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?

They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?

Why you listen when the teachers at school

Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool

Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes

Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it

Underground in they casket? Ancestors turning

I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazareth

Words like God is Greek or Latin

So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters

My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing

Envisioning, owning shit, yo it can happen

What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes

Not enough banks, to give a brother a loan

What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask

For reparations, then they hit us with tax

And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?

So stop being controlled, we black zombies



[Chorus]

Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)

We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)

We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)



[Nas]

Aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, fuck behind bars

We've already gone insane

They've already gave up, cut our own heads offs

Stab our own backs and dream too much

Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and

Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them

Can't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em

On our own people and, fuck black leaders

Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic

Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet-less

All get down and get up

Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck

Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church

Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first

We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated

Just to make another generation, black zombies



[Chorus]



[Nas]

You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance

Feel free, hear the music and dance

If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you

Dumb niggaz with long beards like they Arabs or Jews

Or from Israel, (?)bish'meal Allah, el-rachman, el-Rahim (?)

Islam's a beautiful thing

And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring

Peace against the darkness, which is unGodly

So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?

Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow

That's the sound of the beast

I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid

Control your own destiny, you are a genius

Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years

Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?

Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it

When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it

Do it niggas"

Taught us right Nigga
My old dad imported to the family structure
Provide her God
My moms a queen at university civaliza

My pops maybe was late but always came home

My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on

Soon as he walk in the door she barking

I turned out the Jonny Carson

Jumped out the bed

We grabbed both his legs

Me and my brother

Not knowing the pain he gave my mother

Night after night, fighting yelling at each other

My papa played the street all day

Mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way

She sacrifices all she got to feed us

When she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding

But still I didn't see it

Mama hid it from us

We was kids younger

Till we got bigger, on to

Bigger things that we knew what the time was

That daddy was leaving the crib and moms love



Papa was player, player wasn't papa 

Papa loved the ladies

Never got enough of

Pretty brown round

Running round town (Shhhhh)

Don't tell your mother what's going down

[Repeat 2x]



So many kids I knew, never knew what Pap was

That's why I show my pop love

He was still around when I fucked up

He could have left

My moms pregnant shock to death but stayed

Watch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade

To my first fist fight

Right behind me he would stand

No matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man

Throw dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam 

He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam

Roaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing

Next thing you know he packing

So then I asked him

What's this white shit on that plate and your facing?

Papa why you butt ass from the waist

And who's this lady I'm facing

Dark skin you're not my mommy

He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me

Promise things that he would buy me

If I kept my mouth close and don't tell mommy

He said one day I'll understand little me

Was in you to side me



Papa was player, player wasn't papa 

Papa loved the ladies

Never got enough of

Pretty brown round

Running round town (Shhhhh)

Don't tell your mother what's going down

Pop's told me hold my own

Pop's told me value home

Could I help it papa was a rolling stone

Who loved the pretty brown round

Out of town bound 

Jumping in his jazz Benz he touring

At home I play his latest recordings

And it's strange now how, I do my thing now

I'm in the game now

And heard of it his brain pow

To pull strings and gain power

From weed habits are same now

No white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes

And beats that be pumping

Before he left he taught me something

A child's young years the most important time to be there

That's why he stayed till we grew up, respect is still here

I'm older now see what having a father's about

One day they can be in your life next day they be out

It's not because of you, you know the deal

Him and your moms feel

If they stay together then someone will get killed

I love you still

Always will

Cause that's my nigga

Although you felt you was wrong

I still feel you kid

They're starrin Nas, executive poet, produced directed by

the lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin to survive

The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched

Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin the TV down

While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin, soft in the background

Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns

Stepped over dopefiends, walkin out the door, all of us poor

I learned the difference between the snitches, the real ones, and who's soft

And the murderous, hungriest crews

People jumping from roofs, shotguns pumping, made it through my youth

Walking very thin lines, ages seven and nine

That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth

I know the streets thirst water like Moses

Walking through the hot desert searching to be free

I got this, locked since '9-1

I am the truest, name a rapper that I ain't influenced

Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas

With Hawaiin Sophie fame, kept my name in his music

Check it



[Chorus]



[talking]

Ay yo, pass me the weed, pour my ashes out on these niggas man (no doubt)

Ay, y'all faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the fuckin ring



[Chorus]



I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and fogotten

Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten

Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (uh)

Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face

Y'all some well wishin (bitches), friendly actin envy hidin snakes

With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?

When these streets keep callin, heard it when I was sleep

That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef

Started cockin up my weapon, slowly loadin up this ammo

To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle

This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid

When KRS already made an album called ""Blueprint""

First, Biggie's ya man, then you got the nerve to say that you better than Big

Dick suckin lips, whyn't you let the late, great veteran live



[talking]

(I...will...not...lose)

""God's son"" across the belly, I prove you lost already

The king is back, where my crown at?

(Ill...will) Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas



[Chorus]



Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches

What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother

You traded your soul for riches

My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous

And now I smile like a proud dad, watchin his only son that made it

You seem to be only concerned with dissin women

Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?

Well life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me

or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly

In '88 you was gettin chased through your buildin

Callin my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers

All I did was gave you a style for you to run with

Smilin in my face, glad to break bread with the god

Wearin Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars

No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case

Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin with little Chase

You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan

I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class

You Tae-bo hoe, tryna' work it out, you tryna' get brolic?

Ask me if I'm tryna' kick knowledge

Nah, I'm tryna' kick the shit you need to learn though

That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow

Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?

Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy

Rockefeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter

And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?

Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas

And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas?

Philly's hot rock fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas

In a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas

Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss

What you think, you gettin girls now 'cause of your looks?

Ne-gro please

You no mustache havin, with whiskers like a rat

Compared to Beans you wack

And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame

You ass, went from Jaz to hangin with Kane, to Irv, to Big

And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit

You a dick-ridin faggot, you love the attention

Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons

Ha, R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick

J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick

Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick

Shaun Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick

So little shorty's gettin gunned up and clapped quick

How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips?

Wanted to be on every last one of my classics

You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss"

Well is your creep move potent

I got a bunch of bullets and a bag of guns I pass 'em to my niggaz c'mon

We bi-coastin, keepin our po-ckets bulgin

We got the plan in motion

I got a bunch of bullets and a bag of guns I pass 'em to my niggaz c'mon



[Verse One]

Zoom, from outer space he comes

Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun

Bitches flappin they gums, do he be clappin and shootin guys

Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized

What is his race nation or creed?

Is he arabic, black, latin, asian they read

Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens

Spit at judges, stepped on peasants

But in reality, I just entered your galaxy

September '73, up in these wild streets

Fuckin these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (God damn)

And my mystique got 'em tearin my clothes



[Chorus]



[Verse Two]

My nigga smoke with one lung

If he cough he might die, passin me trees

The liquor bottle's almost empty

We about to collide, with the enemy

Only way you die if it's meant to be

You fuckin with a general

No discussion is the principle we bustin it's the end of you

Now we knockin on your mama door

Like we cam to fix the sink; my kind of war

Death, angels comin for you

Spirit horse runnin from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2

Paramedics fightin for you, who's gon' win?

The hands of time, or the hands of medicine

Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake

Walk by your casket, spit in your face

Enter the fog dog, the light is your guide

And when you're gone all your niggaz gon' light it with Nas



[Chorus]



[Verse Three]

Pardon but I gotta question of life now

Look at the nigga next to you right now

Is he real, fake or scared

Do it like this niggaz right hands in the air

Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart

Now let's say it all together let the ceremony start

I shall - stay real stay true stay holdin figures

Never put a bitch over my niggaz

I shall never, cooperate with the law

Never snake me I always hold you down in war

If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs

I never break the oath to the death I swear

I swear that's how we pledge alegiance, to the alliance

of underworld's killers and thugs, though the science 

of a nigga still yet to be found

So light up some green, and pass it around (just pass it around)

Pull up a chair hon' and put it in the air son
Dog, whatever they call you, god, just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending
The bullet goes back in the gun

The bullet hole's closin this chest of a nigga

Now he back to square one

Screamin, ""Shoot don't please""

I put my fifth back on my hip

It's like a VCR rewindin a hit

He put his hands back on his bitch

My caravan doors open up

I jumped back in the van and closed it shut

Goin reverse, slowly prepared

My nigga Jungle utters out somethin crazy like, ""Go he there""

Sittin in back of this chair, we hittin the roach

The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth

Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar

The blunt turns back into a cigar

We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans

Spinnin records backwards of AC/DC

I give my niggas dap, jump out the van back first

Back upstairs, took off the black shirt

I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear

Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear

The voice on the phone was like, ""Outside right we""

So with my mouth wide, holdin my heat

Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for ya

'Cause Jungle said, ""Block your on enemies the""

Hung up the phone, then the phone rang 

I'm laid in the bed thinkin 'bout this pretty young thing

Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug

She fell to my bed and gave me a hug

I told her, ""No hell""

She talkin 'bout, ""Me kiss""

Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick

Started suckin with no hands, a whole lotta spit

Then got up and put her bra back on her tits

Got fully dressed and told me, ""Stressed really I'm""

Picked up her Gucci bag and left her nigga behind

Walkin through the door, she rang the bell twice

I vomited Vodka back in my glass with juice and ice

The clock went back from three, to two, to one

And that's about the time the story begun

That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell

It said, ""Son we found that nigga we gotta kill""



Ay yo son, ay yo son, you hear me, you hear me?

Listen man, this dude right on the block, right now, man

I found him, right now, I see him right now!

Let's kill him)

One time.. yeah.. yeah..
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib

One God to show me how to do things his son did

Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with

151, one sip'll make a nigga flip

Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit

Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics

Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages

Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us

Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin us

One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up

But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again

Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken

Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in

Blackin out as I shoot back, fuck gettin hit! {*more sirens*}

This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it

'til everybody come home, little niggaz is grown

Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon

Sent from the star sun and the moon

In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers

Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin victims with doctors

IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO DIE, WITH NINES OUT

THIS IS WHAT NAS IS BOUT, NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!

All I need is one mic.. that's all I need

All I need is one mic.. all I need niggaz

All I need is one mic.. yeah



{*gradually getting louder*}

All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen

One prayer - tell God forgive me for one sin

Matter fact maybe more than one, look back

at all the hatred against me, fuck alla them

Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots

from twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two

Which means, one of my guns was holdin 17

Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you

Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral

never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent

Nothin is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs

My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air

I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times

Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines

If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis

Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty

There's nothin in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust

Led flyin, feel it? I feel it in my gut

THAT WE TAKE THESE BITCHES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN

CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!!

All I need is one mic.. that's all I need, that's all I need

All I need is one mic.. there's nuttin else in the world

All I need is one mic.. that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know

All I need is one mic..



{*starting loud this time, getting quieter*}

ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH I'M ONE MAN

WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND

Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical

Talkin all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do

Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you

only if they know, what your weakness is I have none

Too late to grab guns I'm blastin cause I'm a cool nigga

Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggaz

What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin

War gets deep, some beef is everlastin

Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other

up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?

You know the block was ill as a youngster

Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster

For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggaz throwin dirt on my name

Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain

Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished

Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence

Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes

Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight

Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real

Heard he was, tellin police, how can a kingpin squeal?

This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found

You need some soul searchin, the time is now



All I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah

All I need is one mic.. that's all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash

All I need is one mic.. fuck the cars, the jewelry

All I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world"

Yo

Explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers

Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap

As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube

Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube

Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice

Geronimo po-lice jumpin out Chryslers, easywider paper

Pops puffin his sess, punchin his chest like a gorilla

Outside was psychoes, killers

Saw Divine, Goon and Chungo, Lil' Turkey

R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey

Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters

My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean

I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin

Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin

Livin carefree laughin, got jokes on the daily

Y'all actin like some old folks y'all don't hear me

Yo I'm in my second childhood

Yo, dude is 31, livin in his moms crib

Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid

Cornrows in his hair, still slingin, got a crew

They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview

Got babies by different ladies high smokin L's

in the same spot he stood since, eighty-five well

When his stash slow, he be crazy

Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday

Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared

They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds

So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years

Sittin on, different benches like it's musical chairs

All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night

with young dudes it's them he wanna be like

It's sad but it's fun to him right? He never grew up

31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Baby girl she's always talkin name droppin hangin late

Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin

E poppin Ecstasy takin, won't finish her education

Best friend she keeps changin, stuck with limitations

Lustin men, many hotels, Fendi Chanel

With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well

Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve

He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse

No job never stay workin, mad purty

Shorty they call her the brain surgeon

Time flyin she the same person, never matures

All her friends married doin well

She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12

Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights

Selfish in her own right for life, guess she's in her second childhood

He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile

Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul

You need to stay around I feel like telling some stories

First theres this arrogent fuck, his names Cory

Hung around my mans Lakey and Big Trevor

Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin his cheddar

Cory changed his name to ahh, whatever

Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like? It's 'Mega

Right, 'Mega was his name, sorry about that

But its so hard to put a cowards name in my rap

Always actin tough, a jokester be frontin

He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin

But that's Nas always looking out for breddren

Cause when breddren don't return love it don't stress him

Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real

Still laughing to the bank and shit

Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack

Def Jam mad that he signed the contract

Now he got jealous and mad at my shine

Makin silly tapes, I'm always on his mind

Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid

'Mega for the record you could suck my dick!

Bitch, you from around the way it's sad what this do to me

But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

They say the bridge is over, the bridge is over

Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it

They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over

Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggaz kill it

So they say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over

Since we on the subject of traders and flunkies

Mega aint the only faggot in my hood dummies

Theres plenty that wanna be me but cannot

Its like King Arther and Knight Sir Lance-A-Lot

Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul

Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog

Through the ups and downs, robberies and all

Though I always knew he wanted my downfall

He would say his little slick shit and act real funny

For what nigga you're butt and it got back to me

Asking a Braveheart to get back your jewelry

You aint from my hood, don't even rep Q.B.

Nature moved to Marcy

Man dick riding Nature, nothing else to say

Man Nature moved to Marcy

Back with ass niggaz in fear

Fuck them niggaz go head with the progam man proceed

Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief

Of course we aint friends, you never stood on no blocks

Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas

Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger

Just fills me when niggaz let out of town to set shot

And get filthy rich, its just not

No more morals, no loyalty, no more community

Queensbridge, we gotta have unity



(Chorus)



(Nas)

I put the name on the map after Marly and Shan

Q.B. before the ROC had one jam

Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef

Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak

So this about cleaning up house, my own backyard

Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed

P how many times aint you shamed that

Jungle was busting his gun to get your weak chain back

They dont respect you a checks due for me for your fame

'Mega I hope you blow so I'm sayin your name ('Mega, 'Mega)

Hoes play your position cause you'll never be king

Even Jigga want the crown - how that sound? Poor thing

I'm representing Queensbridge U.S.A.

Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay

All you little roaches and rats 

Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back

So haters say

The bridge is over my dick, Bridge'll never be over

Long as I'm alive and breathing, Braveheart to the graveyard

I'm the William Wallace of this shit

Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man

You know what I'm saying, just get them unloyal niggaz

From out your circle, you can't save everybody

niggaz invited you to the hood, rep it right my nigga

Be untouchable my nigga, so it be Mobb for life for real

And thats real, ayo Nature I can't hold your hand through this shit man

I'm not your father man, be your own man, stand on your own two

I believe in you, believe in yourself nigga or dont even rep this

Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta? Theres real gangsta

Shit going on in the streets man, yo niggaz is in the grind

Where you be at man? niggaz be bucking

Why you never bucking, where you be at man?

All of a sudden you the motherfuckin Nino Brown of the fuckin hood

Its disgusting man, stay out the magazines

Keep my name out your motherfuckin mouth

Theres no more room for jealousy, we destroyin and rebuildin

That means the cowards get out and real niggaz stay

niggaz been hatin me since I been nine

Shinin with suede motherfuckin Bally's on and silks

I'ma always be the young don

Don't be like the niggaz on the other side

Hating me cause I'm beautiful, real niggaz in Queensbridge

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Nas, uh, yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo
I come from the housin tenement buildings

Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death

Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell

Though I owe to it my success

With survival of the fittest, everyday is a chal'

I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud

Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign

Like, the darker you are the realer your problems

I reached for the stars but I just kept slippin

On this life mission, never know what's next

Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Cezar

Had a piece of the globe, every continent

Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan

Pakistan, America, Afghanstan

Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics

Call a truce, world peace, stop actin like savages

No war, we should take time and think

The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct

But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fightin

Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then?

Must it go on, we must stop the killin

Tell me why we die, we all God's children



[Chorus - Female singing, Nas in background]

World is hating, that's forever (uh, c'mon)

It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)

Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)

World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world



Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it

That's they corner, from New York to California

Got blocks locked down

Like, ""dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town""

So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison

At an early age, already know it's against him

So in order for him to survive, one day he must

Open up his eyes to the set backs and rise

'Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity

Look at what this country's got

There shouldn't be nobody homeless

How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet

The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone

To all colors increases, to home it belongs

I want land, mansions, banks and gold

The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control

The world's natural resources, all its residuals

But then comes foes, I have to gaurd it with missels

And I become the most wanted

But is it worth hearin a million people problems and followed by Secret Service

I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels

So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo



[Chorus]



Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time

No other compares to what Nas write down

Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours

You could get what you love, be a chain in cause

You alive right now

There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a hot light now

It's whatever man think of manifest to the real

The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals

All this hate can't forever last

All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed

You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again

Hopin I reach the world leaders and win

Ain't nothin without struggle, listen up, it's critical

We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical

In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical

To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual

Top of the world for the kid and unless

Poppin any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest

I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me

You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power

To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now



[Chorus]



[talking]

Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm sayin?

Niggas ain't forget nothin

Men, women and children killed by the police and shit

Niggas ain't gon' forget that, you know what I mean?

Yo, what this war just show me is like, whatever you want out of life

Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it

Even if that means blood and death

You know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about

This is what my country is, and my country's a muthafucka"

[Verse 1] (Nas)

Aiyyo, it's packed on this Riker's bus

The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled

The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso

On the streets I was invincible

Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew

What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killa

Mother's a dopefiend embarrassin' me

All in front of my friends

In the street smile with no teeth

I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy

Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3

Why didn't my folks just die in this society

Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me

Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat

Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me

I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father

Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers

Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high

It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry



Repeat Chorus



[Verse 2] (Millenium Thug)

It is I that step up

Me that don't give a fuck, you that foe, then it's all over soldier

Hummers and Range's through the desert

Fuck a 20-inch, long as we got gas and we got water

Troopers lookin' for manslaughter

I gotta get back, for what they owe

Shoot'em in the back for the get back

Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag

Forget the life had, now we all rebels

Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto

We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble

And debris from the earth as we knew crumble

Yo you could see the sea

And the stars look closer to me

I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max

S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap

My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back

But yo



Repeat Chorus



[Verse 3] (Nas + Millenium Thug)

Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls

I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God

Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape

Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape

How is the war

And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes

Holdin' machine guns

Clean fun, shootin' dudes with fatigues on

Anywhere is better than this

It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit

Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares

I know the warden is readin' the scribe

[MT] But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business

Courts, lawyers and jails

We all slaves in the system, I'm bout to rebel



[Verse 4] (Millenium Thug)

There's not a bitch in sight

Or block bench, or black gate

Or gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President

I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent

Now it's state of the art

I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart

What a bloody mess, a slug fest

I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'

You know I'm spittin' mine

I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win

Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in

I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head

Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back

Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass

I don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake

Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape

And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

Ecstasy, coke - you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin us medicine - which is poison

Doctors injectin our infants - with the poison



[Verse One]

Religion misoverstood is poison

Niggaz up in my hood be gettin shot - given poison

In hospitals, shots riddle the block

Little, children and elderly women run for they lives

Drizzlin rain come out the sky every time somebody dies

Must be out my fuckin mind, what is this, the hundreth time?

Sendin flowers to funerals, readin rest in peace

You know the usual, death comes in threes

Life is short is what some nigga said

Not if you measure life - by how one lives and what he did

And funny how these black killer companies is makin money off us

Fast food, cola, soda, Skull & Bone crosses, it's all poison



[Chorus]



[Verse Two]

Religion misoverstood is poison

Sisters up in my hood try to do good given choices

When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions

Stop workin hopin that they find a man that will support them

Up late night, on they mother's cordless

Thinkin a perm or bleach and cream will make them better when they gorgeous

White girls tannin, lyposuction

Fake titties are implanted, fake lips that's life destruction

Light-skinned women, bi-racial hateful toward themselves

Denyin even they blood

I don't judge Tiger Woods but I, overstand the mental poison

That's even worser than drugs - yo it's poison



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Religion misoverstood is poison

Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison

And any thoughts of takin me down is poison

Who want beef now, my heat shall annoint them, plaow



[Interlude]

Never to worry

All the wrong doers got it coming back to 'em a thousand times over

Every dog has it's day, and everything flips around

Even the most greatest nation in the world has it comin back to 'em

Everybody reaps what they sews, that's how it goes

Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse but we'll get through it

Y'all, be strong



[Verse Three]

The China-men built the railroad, the Indians saved the Pilgrim

And in return the Pilgrim killed 'em

They call it it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday hell-day

Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy

Me and my niggaz share gifts, e'ryday like Christmas

Slay bitches, and party e'ryday like this is the last

I'm with my heckles, connectin and we hittin the lab

This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

It's all poison, all of my words to enemies it is poison

Rappers only talk about ki's, it's all poison

How could you call yourself MC's? You ain't poison

Think about the kids you mislead, with the poison

And any thoughts of taking me down is all poison

Who want beef now, my heat shall annoint them, plaow

What goes around comes around my nigga

And what goes up it must come down my nigga

The soldiers found below the ground my nigga

Just hold it down we older now my nigga

What goes around comes around my nigga

And what goes up it must come down my nigga

The soldiers found below the ground my nigga

Just hold it down we older now my nigga



[Verse Four]

This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes

Fuckin sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C.

This is the problem cause he never tell 'em he got it

from lettin fags suck him off, Rikers Island in nine-three

Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties, all the concerts

Backstage where the stars be, rockin they shirts

in bitches faces like clockwork - what's your name, where you from?

Chain blingin, thinkin girls everywhere is dumb

Takin pride in ruinin they lives

So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives

He never used a condom, give him head he got ya

Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS

I contemplate, believin in karma

Those on top could just break, and won't be eatin tomorrow

I know some bitches who be sleepin on niggaz dreams, they leave

When that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees

Knowin dudes that's neglectin they seeds

Instead of takin care of 'em they spendin money on trees

I pray for you, deadbeat daddies

Cause when them kids get grown it's too late for you

Now you old and you gettin shitted on

It's all scientific, mystic, you know the Earth and the stars

Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas

What is destined shall be

George Bush killer 'til George Bush kills me

Much blessings be healthy, remember

Welcome to our time
[Jessica Care Moore]
Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles

Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write

Despite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight

Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right

Winged assassins laughin while the New World's collapsin

Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armed with cowries, I'm blastin

As the Earth rebels my womb swells

The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit

You can't find if you ain't never had it

Spiritually crafted black-listed hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted

Power-shiftin comb-fistin I predict Goddesses you runnin after witches

I kiss my fourteen stitches

Keep all my baby girl wishes

I predict all the oceans turn dry

Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert

We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers

Wash your face between our legs

While recreating humanity, we will summon yemanja

Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills

Ban all pink and yellow pills

I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch

Hate groups will be bombed

Childbirth becomes outlawed

Always will be branded numbered and logged

All paper money is gone

Confused scholars can interpret our scrolls

Your sky has holes

We know the young is old

It's the life we chose, where friends become foes

and the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know

This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes

and the only way out, is death or goin broke

This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings

That's why there ain't too many happy niggaz in it

And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..

(but yo..) this life is the only life I know {*echoes}

Uhh, uhh, uhh

Gold bathtubs, makin love to my Queen

Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rollin up green

Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall

My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine

Closets, full of rockets and submachines

Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team

Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides

Mr. Child both coasts with the most loud toast

Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dyin

Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealin with science

My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it

They never know we enemies until they hear me say it

Til they kid's on the phone sayin, ""Please daddy pay it""

Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement

High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss

You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence

It's strategic, how these niggaz want you to think

You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep

Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink

You get showered by lead, comin out with your mink

Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles

Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico

It's hard fuckin with niggaz you hope you can trust

You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck

And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?

Shit is devious, ex-friends wantin you stuck



Chorus

Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?

He wanna stick you

What's love, you got beef?

Nobody rollin wit you

What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care

Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the air?

What's real, when you know your man's girl is a hoe

And you don't even let him know, cause you fucked her befo'

What's real, when you talk behind a man's back

then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?

What's trust, when they seperate your case

When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face

What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?

And he never crossed you, but you claimin he's fam'?

What's trust, when you get bust, your niggaz don't retaliate?

They blaze purple haze with em the next day?

God forbid one of my niggaz get hit, I'ma go haywire

Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire

But everybody's different, you won't know how you react

til you in that position, and that's an actual fact

The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?

You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you

Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90

On your deathbed you regret bein grimy

What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?

A ghetto child raised around drugs, til he's old enough to bust slugs?

Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse

when he come home to catch another case?

Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it

You did it, heaven or hell or prison

Who knows when your clock'll stop tickin, get your weight up

This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies

Turnin into the things moms wanted you not to be

Crime followin the wrong dudes who have no values

Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you

Even though your decision won't help you benefit

Bitches money and guns, aimin and you fire

Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin your seed

Tryin to eat? You form material needs

The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off

by stickin up niggaz, make them take they jewels off

His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span

He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan

What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers

And any chance he get, he can take niggaz

He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is

when he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me

You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head

And if I let go I'm dead

He stepped at my door, the ? motivate my spirit

And now the body experience, so now I feel it

Lookin at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me

Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary

I never hate, that's just wasted energy

The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?

The future - and time only reveals, what fear is

False expectations, appearin real

We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told

and I will til permanently, my eyes are closed

If you ill come get me, cause I ain't runnin

If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunnin

Come get me if you real, cause I ain't scared

It's all fair in love and war

1 -and I'm well prepared

2 -we can take it there



[Nas]

You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?

If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt

Your crew knew I blew up, I been shinin - baseball diamonds

Dick rings for your chicklings

Niggaz know what my nine pearl handle's about

Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South

And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i

Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?

Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?

You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me

Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three

Next level - I take y'all niggaz to 3-D

Can't find a nigga shook from Queens

I'll be with the most grimy killers 

(what nigga) and they all look clean

who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start

Your next stop is to the graveyard



Chorus



[Nas]

You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft

You talk but you scared to go back up North

Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nuttin

Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop frontin

You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again

Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn

Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore

Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor

So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line

I got nines, every color shape and design

I sent killers every race to put one in your spine

Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?

Nobody never get involved and none of em dyin

I think like you do, roll with about two irons

Catch me flyin, high in the aircraft winin

- and dinin, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass

?? to gauze up, your stab wounds

While I'm gettin head, in a Lear jet, bathroom

With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases

full of paper, not money it's bank statements

The Illmatic that explains how we rock

Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block

One 44, two 45's
3 loaded clips, 4 niggas roll, one nigga drives
500 Benz, 6 reasons why 
This kid should die
We shootin every motherfucker outside

Pulled on his block, jumped out the car, guns in our hand

At the same time everybody ran

There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd

Let the trigger blow, 7 shots now he lying on the ground

Blood on the floor

Then we shot some more 

Niggas he was with

2 niggas hit, one nigga fell

One tryed to run, go get him son 

Make sure he's done before we bail, i aint trying to goto jail

Must handle beef, code of the street 

Load up the heat, if these nigga think they could fuck around

Real niggas do real things

By all means, niggas knowin how we get down.. It goes......



Chorus (3X)

Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what..

(whispering) 

Kill kill kill, murder murder murder



[Nas]

Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet

6 tinted windows, and I'm on my way

To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house

Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out

Ringin the bell, where in the hell

Could they be at, I'm about to leave

Steppin' slow, where my truck was at

Who the fuck is that?

Could it be a jack?

Now pull my strap, it's my man

And we have the same plan

There them bitches go

Civic '94, looking funny though 

Open up the car door, funny smile

Fuck 2 already, 3rd ass was heavy 

""Nas this is Sherri, Sherri this is Nas, and his man. Ready?""

Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes 

Ran through them hoes 

Plenty ice, that they all seemed to like

Can't find my man, heard a blam blam

Now I'm wonderin, ""In this scam, do I even stand a chance?""

He killed the hoes, took all they doe

Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky

Comin down the stairs

Now he wantin mine, reachin for my nine 

Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time

my nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering 

""Put your gun down, we can skip town""

Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat

Lift off his chain

Took his shit, emptied out close range...



Chorus (4X)

Turn the front page the next day my life is like a book

A twenty four hour song without no hook

Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug

Turn quarters when you turn quarters know who to plug

Thugs around me outside its grimmy outside

Better slide before you get bodied outside

Livin hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail

My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house

I'm the place many fear cause there's no way out

I take the sun away put misery instead

When you wit me most folks consider you dead

I saw too many inmates fallin apart

Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark

Convicts think they alone but if they listen close

They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse

All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin

I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin)

I make it hotter in the summer colder in the winter

If the court paroal ya then another con enters

No remorse for your tears I seen em too often

When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin

Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep

Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me

Face to face with a cage no matter your age

I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage

Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out

Cause only you and I know what sufferings about

Yo it's stunning when bed sheets become your woman

And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comming

Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you

You'll always be my property nigga stay legal

You can't take the slums out my Dunns 

and that's how it is, that's how we live

Sometimes I find myself wearin the same shit for days

not carin, bout what they gon' think or say

I got that, ""I don't give a fuck"" in me, it's stuck in me

That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggaz, y'all too pretty

We too gritty, like Sanford and Son (what)

Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on

See we the top rap niggaz, the Q-Dogs

You got a lot of nerve, puttin out them songs

This is where your career stop at

I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me

You ballet? They read your obituary, in front your family

You should idolize Nas in the flesh

Don't wait til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt

We shot hoops with coathangers, got loot with dopeslangers

Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger

Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit

Bought weight from rosters, travel hot routes

O.T. commute back and forth

Tell shorty get that package off

Fuck bein trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit

Caught a case then I beat the shit

Theives on the block flash badges, nylon jackets

Big white boys with guns yellin, ""Freeze black kids!""

Got my niggaz in the pen, eatin octopus

Wishin they was on the blocks with us

to watch me and P do it (uh) put the heat to it (uh)

Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it

Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music

and think deep to it, now who the truest?

And I'ma be that same nigga for the door

To my thugs in the prisonyard, bench-pressin 200 pounds and up

Feelin like you down on your luck

Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library

Appeal the game, all eyes on me

Restrained from, bein looked at, as uncivilized

God love us hood niggaz (I know)

Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggaz (I know)

and the killers, God love us good niggaz (I know)

Cause on the streets is the hood niggaz, uhh

And I know he feel us, uhh

God love us hood niggaz (I know)

Cause he be wit us in the prisons

and he takes time to listen, uhh

God love us hood niggaz (I know)

Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggaz, uhh

but he forgive us



[Nas]

He who has ears, let him hear

And he who has sight, let him see

He who has life, let him be

See everything goes through change

Those who know don't talk

and those who talk don't know a thing

Men are born soft and turn tough

Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God

I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart

by the beast but he missed his mark

Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up

when I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all

Yo it came to me, the pain in me

Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be

It strangely seemed, like it was a dream

but the si-rens had never woke me

Only reason I'm here now is cause God chose me

And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga

But God love us hood niggaz



Chorus



[Nas]

Day by day by day I sit back and pray

My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage

They pass away, they went off the casket way

My gats will spray, but that won't bring em back today

So long my crimies now gone for eternity

The team we got left on the set, now turn to me

Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind

I ride past the church where they got his body and find

they takin him to the hearse to put his body in dirt

That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt

Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution

As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses

Loadin clips up, countin bullets carefully

For self, though it feels like, he was there for me

Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me

They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin me



Chorus



[Nas]

Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood

Thugs wit guns become celebrities in the hood

Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood

Little girls have seeds by O.G.'s in the hood

It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood

You can choose if you would, coke to sniff

Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees

ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood

You can starve in the hood

Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood

But it's good in the hood

I was raised in the hood

Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood

I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood

Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood

There's AIDS (uh) in the hood (WHAT?)

Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke

That's the main reason why God, love us the most

It's wild where we walk kid

Is you brave nigga

Is you a slave nigga

Is you a made nigga

Or is you a paid nigga



Well known gangstas, in trust

That we bust

Your heart and soul lies with us

Boldly go where we once took a nigga before

Now the motha fucka beggin for more

Its the reason

Standin here shakin, hatin the haters

They watchin my paper

Realize, a 4 5 will open his eyes

Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop

Nigga standin there just like a cop

Braveheart I'm screamin up the block

Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact

Don't let me get up and show yawl motha fucka's respect

Plans connect

The twinkle and diamonds upon my neck

More jazz than Hornecek

I blast and leave your corner wet

Straight on top of ya

Spittin like the trench coat mafia

Was poppin yawl

We made our change was stoppin yawl

I miss the shit of days we did this

Please free John Gotti

They kept the black man eatin, not killin everybody

Drug wars is real

You have no friends in the outfield

Foul balls is deaf, umpires keep ice grilles

Theres no tomorrow its the bottom of the 9 9

Can't die a broke man with a bitch thats fine

My hearts full of braveness so who the fuck will want to save this

Fallen angel from fallen star and chaos on this nation

Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin

You can find us in the hood; thuggin and regulatin

Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin

Rege on the regular chops is up; like a editor

Come through on man gang like the predator

If yawl wake I'll wet it up

Air out your area, Queens Bridge forever, what

Ill will the label

Yo when those niggas ran these niggas stayed

With these niggas switched up and bitched up afraid

These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge

Those niggas got jail and sick cause we paid

I can hit it then stay

We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice

It's your night, no stress, no fight

Mad at your ex, cause his dough tight

Never go right when you're with him

Try your best to forget him

Cause it's easy to please me

CD skip when your head board hit the wall

Call for the law

Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue

Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up

You can hit a blunt if you want

I'ma pull my pants up

We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust

Tell me what's the reason for us

To love or to fuck

I'm the thug that you want

If it's gangster we can't front

If you want me I can stay around

If you need me, I'm here for you

How that sound?

Now it's up to you

Depending on how you wanna get down

Cause you're a big girl now

Got your name and your number in my cell phone

Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone

If you in a good mood, if you not

Or you thinking bout you was at my spot

What we did when we got hot

Is you dreaming you had me?

Is you creaming your panties?

Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me

On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink

And we ate each other like candy

Under the covers, two intimate lovers

You fuck a nigga like you mad at me

Throw the ass to me

You should be glad to be

In the presence of a real thug as bad as me

While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad

You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard

How I'm making my rod, how I make you say ""Oh God""

Every hoe that you know wanna know Nas

Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard

Cause you know how these girls are

Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra

Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions

Starting to get an erection

Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing

Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave

I need time to breathe

Wanna follow me, Ironically

You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe

Like it's my fault

But you don't wanna talk

Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden

You and the shorty start scuffing

Now shorty dumping you out

Can't let her get the best of you

So I rescue you

Only thing left to do was to grab her

So you can jab her, get a cheap shot

You don't wanna feel chumped

Now here the cops come

So we gotta run to the ride

Then we drive off through the traffic

Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage

Looking at your face

And the damage in your facial

Every angle can't let it faze you

No reason to be insecure or immature

Baby girl see the world is yours

It's been a long time, been a long time comin
Looks like the death of me now
But you know, there's no turning back now

This is what makes me - this is what I am



[Puff] Feel me? Let's go



[Base Chorus: Puff Daddy]

You can hate me now.. but I won't stop now..

Cause I can't stop now.. you can hate me now..

But I won't stop now.. cause I can't stop now..

You can hate me now.. you can hate me NOWWWW..



[1st Chorus: add Nas after each pause]

Q.B., real niggas, Bravehearts, c'mon



[1st Chorus: after Nas add Puff Daddy ad lib]

Well you hate me I'm gon' hate you too

It's as simple as that

Die motherfucker die motherfucker die

You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck

Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)

Weak, jealous motherfuckers (do it now, do it now)

Fuck y'all!



[Verse 1]

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy

Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes

Picture me rollin, sixes, money foldin

Bitches honies that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya

Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer, prize winner

Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater

Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters

Commentators ringside try watchin my paper

Almost a decade, quite impressive

Most of the best is in the essence

for this rap shit that I stand for

Expandin more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams

But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens

Want me off the scene fast, but good things last

like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash

First rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects

but you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest



[Puff Daddy]

Money is power motherfucker

I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch (do it now)

[2nd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]

You can hate me

I hate you too

You can hate me now..

[Nas] Do it now, I told you do it now

[Puff] Let's go



[Verse 2]

You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do

but keep gettin money, funny I was just like you

I had to hustle hard never give up, until I made it

Now y'all sayin that's a clever nigga, nuttin to play with

Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G

People warn me, when you're on top there's envy

Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us

Sayin we left the hood but can't get it out of us

My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?

Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too

Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code

Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect hoe?

Nickname Esco', took this game to its threshold

Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know

Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?

Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right



[Puff Daddy]

You think I'ma come this far, and let you niggas stop me now?

I hate you too!! (Do it now!)



[Base Chorus]



[3rd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]

I won't stop

I can't stop

You can hate me

I hate you too

You can hate me now..

You can hate me now..



[Puff] I like this.. I like the way this feels



[Verse 3]

It's a thin line between paper and hate

friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights

Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come

Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs

Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows

Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one

Took a little time to claim my spot

Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord

Ride for the cause while drivin niggas shot at my doors

Plottin I'm sure to catch me with they glocks to my jaws

Tried, stickin me up, but I flipped on these ducks (you tried)

Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up (that's what you get)

Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer

Guess it's just the fury of man

Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin

I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin

C'mon



[Puff Daddy]

You ain't never seen a nigga like me, ever in your life

And that's what you can't understand!



[Base Chorus]



[4th Chorus: start w/ Puff Daddy, then after each pause]

Yo, yo yo yo

Carolyn, from Maryland, she Lady Heroin

She elegant -- her apparel in the M-Class caravan

Ki's of dope, lovin cats to ski in her dope

She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat

Her iced throat, ass is curvy, 40 years old

She passin for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's

Madison Ave., shoppin when she not, coppin bricks of that shit

She hoppin on dicks, ridin Pony's who trick

At my man's wake, she said the eulogy

After that I usually, bumped into her shoppin for jewerly

Her bodyguard screwin me, I gave her my math

Ain't nothin new to me, blowin backs out, six-pack Stout's

Wide fat mouth, the evil look, with a bow-leg

Yo niggaz said, ""Shorty's a pro, she blow heads

She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her""

A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy

She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck

She knew about, cats from way back, we smoke the haystack

She never cough once, blunts was her hobby

She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, not since he tried to rob me

I jetted though, sometimes you never know

He snorted all her work, now she need me, to do her dirty work



It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")

Nigga you reap what you sew

What goes around, comes around

If you sleep you don't know

A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")

where beef could never end

At the time you least expect it

I'ma see you again

It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")

You get away with it now

Soon enough it catches up to you

Someway, somehow

Yo it's a small world

Watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")



Snook from Redhook was grimy, did five years, glad to be home

from Attica known, for keepin chrome calibers

Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it

Five years plannin to blow, soon as he hit the bri-dicks

Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low

Played the crib for a month, and deaded his P.O.

Started robbin niggaz til he caught a whole kilo

He had a bunch of starvin niggaz he owe, he never paid though

Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""

Layin with his bitch, niggaz is rich, is what he told her

Played the block, holdin cracks inside the baby stroller

Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over

A year went past, Snook went flossin fast

His old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash



It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")

Nigga reap what you sew

What goes around, comes around

If you sleep you don't know

I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why

we let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull

Another thug died, pitchin your soul, into that infinite

black hole, where many souls go cause of a fo'-fo' blast

Snook was one of em, so many more

Even that Fendi whore, got niggaz hit up yeah let that Henny pour

Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich

Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God

Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job

He was close to her, ever since she took him inside

When his moms died, dopefiend OD-ed, eighty-five

He went crazy, stuck up banks, to stay alive

He was live - do niggaz even know the things that he tried

Robbed armored trucks - incidents where po-lice died

He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God (peace God)

He starin at me hard

Two of his mans with him, I got to hit em

I'm reachin for my Roscoe, cocked it back on, and get my blast on

At the gas station, bunch of Arabs racin

out the way, as my Torah spray, jump in the whip

Hit the highway, you know how I say, the game that I play

It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies

but can't figure out whose who, keep it true

Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never

Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar



It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")

Check it out

It's on, and once again I bring niggaz the rough

Fuckin with us, that get you motherfuckers touched

Hit in the darkest alleys, where the super sports Rally

Beatin up the block, leavin these motherfuckers shot

They ain't ready for the Nakamici

I flip this shit like I'm Kamaneze

Now dey a motherfuckin see me

They try to breeze me, but I got niggaz in New York 

comin kama-kize, sparkin this shit that keep me off the heezee

Jay-Hovah, he with my man came over

to scoop me, blowin dukey, in the black Range Rover

Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for

Tell these niggaz why we here



[Nas]

Nuttin but the New York to Texas connection

Nuttin but some real shit, what y'all expected

Spaz out, some times dreamin, think I'm awoke

Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke

Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me 

that's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me

I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian

Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain

My, Houston niggaz, come through for niggaz

Scarface get a call and we shootin niggaz

Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business

Tryin to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?



[Chorus: Nas]



You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted

Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor) [3X]

I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted

Any nigga can get it



[Scarface]

You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at

So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin cap

Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information 

bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back

Cause when it come down to the come down;

I'ma pull the motherfuckin plug on him

Walk up to his face and then gone

Set a example, send these hoes a little message:

They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it

Leaded, I pull these capers all the time

With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin mind

Him and whoever standin by, I'll tell these niggaz, ""Let's go""

And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die

He fin' to die, throwin up his own blood

With a slug in his motherfuckin mug

I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here

Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor



[Chorus]



[Nas]

A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose

To his wake we send a wreath that explodes

Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed

That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe

Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five mercedes

Attack em like Freddie, then we toastin over spaghetti

I share withcha drama, you share with mine

That's how we killin two birds at the same time

Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger

with a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga

Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war

Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw

Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art

And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin

Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life

Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa

To my dogs.. wherever you are
Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid

You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid

Ain't nuttin changed -- still _Party and Bullshit_

We used to +Fuck R&B Bitches+ and see who rhyme sickest

For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out

_Machine Gun Funk_, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts

You came to my hood, we was broke

I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?

Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so

Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto

But fuck it black, you livin your life, though your loved ones

Peace to your daughter and your newborn son

It used to be fun, makin records to see your response

But, now competition is none, now that you're gone

And these niggaz is wrong -- usin your name in vain

And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that

It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you

Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official

Ain't too many real ones out there; I feel some 

but doubt they're, capable, to take it where you took it to

I missed your wake not cause I'm fake

cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way

I woulda stayed so long with so much to say

I had to put it in writin to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin

Tellin me to pay my respects and move to the side

But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by

You can't kill nothin that's _Ready to Die_

You was like God to us in the form of Allah



Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

Thug Life never die..



Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop -- and use teeth 

to bite off beer tops, and _Pour Out a Lil' Liquor_

You was more than just the wildest nigga

+2Pacalypse+, I understand your style nigga

It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone

On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on

The industry be talkin, offendin me often

They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin

I can relate, shootouts and court dates

+All Eyez on You+, niggaz in your face invadin your space

You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?

How long would I ride, before I fold up?

How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?

You predicted it in every line, all in your flow

There could _Never Be Peace_ I have to quote

Can't believe I heard my name on ""the realest shit you ever wrote""

We had words cause the best supposed to clash at the top

but kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped

in NYC, at MTV, people watched

We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep

Think about how us real niggaz would be

If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?

You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified

like the son of God, when Lucifer lied

and make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?

But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link

Will there ever be another MC as nice?

Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?



Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

Still, we, will survive

No matter what, my people just stay alive

Still, we, will survive

No matter what, my people just stay alive



I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?

Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?

What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?

Was it the drugs -- put an end to the music business?

If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down

a plan and pursue my dream turn my life around

Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream

I'll need a extra Uzi riding through my own hood in Queens

It be the ones you always knew, that want it on

Tellin everybody it was him, that you fronted on

Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty

Not used to walkin in the path of legit money

I thought I made it but we only took baby steps

Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks

To my clicks when I got it I said ""Baby bless""

That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess

We in the 90's, and finally it's lookin good

Hip-hop took it to billions, I knew we would

A lot of ups and downs in the game, could lose or gain

a couple pounds tryin to maintain -- one day you here

the next you not; when you around niggaz, check 'em out

Some is bout it, most individuals plots

and run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves

While others have no cares and stay in jail

More than fifty percent of us

endin up with holes through the chest

through the head, through the gut it shows

The future for us young shooters and old killers

Who become rich as dope dealers?

Nothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments

Thug coaches with subs sittin on the bench; either that or rap

We want the fast way outta this trap

Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin crack

To my deceased Gods wishin I could bring you back

But life is a dream and y'all taught me that



.. always survive.. but why?

But can you hang with a young man who's doin his thang?

Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up

Step up to the White House let me in

And we built this motherfucker

You wanna kill me because my hunger?

Mr. America young black niggaz want ya

I wanna talk to the man understand

Understand this motherfuckin G-pack in my hand

Look what happened to San Fran young girl hit by policeman

Twelve shots up in her dome, damn

Niggaz thought we slept but the architect sent

The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret

The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now

Extension on Earth, human cutdown

Niggaz play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations

On Mars plottin civilizations

Dissin us discriminatin different racisis

Tax payers pay for more jail for black latin faces



Chorus



[Nas]

I'm just a black man why y'all made it so hard damn

Niggaz gotta go create their own job

Mr. Mayor imagine if this was your backyard

Mr. Governor imagine if it was your kids that starved 

Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive

Swing a mack to be live cart ack to get high

It's the ghetto life yea I celebrate it I live it

And all I got is what you left me with I'ma get it

Now y'all combinin all the countries we goin do the same

Combine all the cliques to make one gang

It ain't all about a black and white thing

It's to make the change, citizens of a higher plane



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Before you hear this rewind this 4 minutes before we timeless

Let y'all niggaz bang my shit before Saddam hits

The Nastradamus tell us what time it is

They try to buy us with doe

Fake black leaders of puppets always talking bout the city budget

The news got it all confused lyin to the public

They eyes watchin stay wise move above it

Water floods predicted hurricanes twisters

Its all signs of the Armageddon three sixes

People reverse the system politics verse religion

Holy war muslim verse christians

Niggaz in high places they don't have the balls for this

People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us

Mr. President I assume it was negligence

The streets upside down, I'm here to represent this



[Chorus] - 2X



[Nas]

Can I talk to you Mr. President

Niggaz tryin to get with the computers

Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga

A weed head, a coke sniffer

You rich or a broke nigga

Know you all relate to this shit that i wrote niggas

Lots of my mans trapped up in a max

Penatentary, sending me letters i answer back

That eventually, we all be bentley'ed out

Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House

My niggas control Senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted

Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit

Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day

So I'm on point, scrap, prepare for gunplay

Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar

Ready to blast ,nigga gave me daps said I feel ya

Can't believe how my life changed

From the hood, the first time in my life I can say i did the right thing

See how funny it is when your kids aint got no father

Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)

Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)

Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)

Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit

Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bumb shit

Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light

Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night

Now what? (what) realize that you ain't got shit (uh)

Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit

So just peep the flow yo, cause you already in this

Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)

Fuck the misery, you po we gettin doe

Except the ?dollars? other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)

Time is viable

Low and behold the young, black, and powerful

Got to eat yo, everyday my daughters feet grow

You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow

Payin doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried

That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit

Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)

If you catch a bad deal, watch your life deminish

Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it

Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit

Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best

prepare for the worse, no fears no nothing on earth

No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first

Get yours nigga
Cuz Imma get mine
In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines

I say this one time

The last time, I swear to ya'll

I'm from where

The dope fiends is at

And killas crawl

And snitches call police

All these niggas and street

Corners everybody's like

Smokin' marijuana and

Snuffin' niggas in faces & startin' drama and

Shootin' niggas in cold blood, just kill 'em, so what

With the fo' pound go nuts

Betta slow up

Before you get your ass on up

Nigga never gonna grow up

Drinkin' the Henney

But her know he gonna throw up

Tryin' to make crack sales

What it look like? The future for a black male

Don't want to make my momma cry

On a front page for a homicide

Fly whips, all I wanted to drive

Where chicks get blunted & ride

Do 105 in the fast lane

And a fast pace chasin' the papas

Spendin' chips on big chains

And the dimes that give brains

That was a 80's and 90's thing

Now I'm into big things



(1st Chorus)

I ain't fuck with you

Now I'm into big things

Gotta get my life together man

Cuz now I'm into big things

Nah, I ain't gonna rhyme wit you

Cuz now I'm into big things

You know I can't do that shit no more

Now I'm into big things



Nah, I can't fuck with you

I'm into big things

Nah, I ain't gonna stand on the corner

I'm into big things

Now the talk is small talk

I'm into big things

I'm into big things

The big things

The big things



(Verse 2)

When I started this

All I wanted was cars and cribs

Like other rap artists but

Do I know where I'm goin' to?

Can I forget when I came from?

I be showin' you

Another style Imma flow for you

Can I make somethin' wild

I can throw for you, flow for you

Make it bi-coastal

Take it to heights

That some of ya'll can't come close to?

Some of ya'll 

Want to talk like hoes

Worse than bitches

And when ya'll niggas see me blow

Bet it hurt like stitches

No competition

I stop and twist 'em

Hit 'em like a mafia proposition

I'm glad ya'll stopped and listen

Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in

Look up at a nigga nod

Rocks are glistenin'

Can't stop my mission

Make anotha LP drop

I'm hittin'

With the new shit exclusive

No time to get caught up in a crime

I ain't have shit to do with

Used to chase the hoes

Now I chase the dough

Is ya'll bitches gonna help me get paper?

No!

(Verse 3)

I go past ya'll

Ya'll got the glass jar

And when I hit it, admit it

Ya'll on ya'll ass ya'll

We on the same team

You don't wanna pass the ball

Chuck and gun up the dough

You want to score

But you really don't want to ball

I put you on

It was me that introduced you to wealth

Crossin' me

Is like shootin' yourself

Wanna blow so fast now do it yourself

You ain't shit now

You was so ill, why you never came out

Where ya clique now

Where you sit now

In the back seat

Mad cuz I flip styles

And I pack heat

Make you run laps

Like a pro athlete

An' I done that

>From my experiences

I appear relentless

Take more time

Just to hear my sentence

Imma tell you what's real

An' what could stop you from makin' a mil

You could prevent this

When niggas don't see eye to eye to you

Lie to you

Wanna get high wit you

Want to eat food off of your labor

And take food off your table

Cuz they don't see your vision

Don't understand your mission

Is to make history

While you here

How long you plan on livin'

Not for forever

At least to 140

Pray for me

I'm tryin' to eat

Like the niggas who bought

Motown on Berry Gordy

Good God



(2nd Chorus)

Nigga I'm tired of games

I'm into big things

Gotta get my life together man

Cuz now I'm into big things

Now the talk is small talk

Cuz now I'm into big things

I'm into big things

The big things

The big things



Man we already did that

Now I'm into big things

No time to get sidetracked

Now I'm into big things

Get money now besides that

Some more big things

I'm into big things

Same time a man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain

I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame

Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine

Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?

That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim

On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees

Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze

Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads

To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough

To the big dogs living large, taking in light

Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life

Is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it

Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked

Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt

And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell

NAS, NAS



""Nas is like"" Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires

Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver

Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars

Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas

""Nas is like"" Iron Mike, messiah type

Before the Christ, after the death

The last one left, let my cash invest in stock

Came a along way from blasting, tecs on blocks

Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres

From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough

Dimes, giving fellatio, siete zeros

Bet my nine spit for the pesos

But what's it all worth, can't take it with you under this Earth

Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked

They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid

Before my number's called, history's made

Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die

Making choices, that determine my future under the sky

To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why

It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?

Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite

Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is



""Nas is like"" Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet

I'm like beef, bustin heat through your windows

I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather

Like Greeks in Egypt, learning somethin deep from they teachers

I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for

Always got you, I’m like Pac dude you would cry for

I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money

Corporate accounts from a rich company

I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races

Combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam

Bulletproof Hummer man

I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam

I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand

I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet

Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up

Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night

Now"

She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless

Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this

Showed me how excitin life is

I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks

The sheistiest, put you on they heist list

How we met it must have been fate

First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak

She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid

How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid

She said she want to have a family raise kids someday

Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day

I can get with that I drop you off home 

I call you hit me back

I wanna dig that and did I? I did that

Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had

You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats

You precious more precious than lost treasure

Matter of fact I'm kinda hopin we can stay together



[Chorus]



[Nas]

I see you dressed up in white face covered in vail

Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwin rice

And it's the day that your father give you away

to a real man that gently put the ring on your hand 

Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to

Now, look me in my eyes and say I do

Drivin off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates

We can spend our honeymoon in the states

You can throw your friend the bouquet

Somethin in the back of my head say

For us two, maybe cuz I love you

Hug you squeeze you touch you tease you 

As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you

Won't stop til I tell you me to beautiful

Deeper and harder love layin new with you

Runnin my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by

while I'm wit you and I won't even care, word



[Chorus]



[Nas]

She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's

Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas

Thug ones to those soft as baby shit

She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips

Til one day she decided to flip

It was nuttin I can do about it, like she the boss and shit

Started talkin this divorcin shit

I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake 

Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that 

Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that

Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that

All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass

Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look 

With her fine-ass body and a damn good cook

For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too

You my queen God bless you

She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold

Heart-broken she walked right out of mad nigga's life

So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife

And I aint gonna loose her like those other lames did

I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big

She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions

Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions

Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked

Bankers and diplomats

She the scratch on my back

Turn niggas out, one touch

For you, my guns bust

You always said in GOD we trust

Its hard enough to keep counting on you

You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you

I think I like'd you better when you where illegal

But you had to get professional

Now when we fuck we use profalactic, hard plastic

Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick

Said you'd give me luxuary, when I asked it

Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya ASSets

Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me

Gamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars
Flashin cameras, dealers, shufflin cards

Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd

cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob

I never hang out, when we do we bust the four-five

cause shells comin back at us while we jump in the ride

Flyin, duckin, our bitches in the club cluckin

Tellin my wife who I was dancin with like I was fuckin

Flew back, Monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin

to the concrete jungle of cement

Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin

Told my dogs peace, kept in movin, I was beat when

got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?

Ringin the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure

Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door

Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low

My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo

to the back, she must be inside and can't hear

Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin her hair

I walked in through the back door entrance

Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense

chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses

and lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas

A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands

Somethin swingin on the ceilin fan, I stopped it

Swingin slower and slower..

On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughin

Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin made me disregard it

Started my way up to where the noise and music was at

Froze, I couldn't react

Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin with some nigga

mumblin shit, he had one hand on her ass

and she was rubbin his dick, toastin wine glasses

Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit

Searchin for words I found none, without a sound

I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun

Now I'm out buggin, whylin, what I'm gon do?

Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin through

I thought you cared for me

I thought you needed me

Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost

I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off

""Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?""

I said, ""Nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip

Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play

To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway

I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years

what I just saw happenin -- and probably still is

Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin my wiz

I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid

I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me""

Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me

Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement

20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with

My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me

We pulled up, he was walkin out the house backwardly

Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us

Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater

Walked to the front when I talked he had junk

Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot

Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in

Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend

One between the eye, she's died, by mistake

Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face

Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies

Heard si-rens, I guess we goin out we out like kamikazes

We surrounded, red lights flashin, who's inside?

Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin suicide

Horse asked me for the Mac, he gave me dap, one love

Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back

Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin on

Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms

Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin

Put it on her ring finger cocked the glock, and started prayin

to Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial

through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin

I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed

this'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene

On that note, same time, the cops busted in

Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""

Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close

Squeeze the toast, said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope""



.. we elope ..

The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray

Dipped attache, jumped out the Range, empty out the ashtray

A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay

Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns

Regulate wit my Dunn's, 17 rocks gleam from one ring

Yo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing

There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King

The highlights of livin, Vegas style roll dice in linen

Antera spinnin on Milleniums, twenty G bets I'm winnin them

Threats I'm sendin them, Lex with TV sets the minimum

Ill sex adrenaline

Party with villians, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny

Wet any clique, with the semi-tech who want it

Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock I lace em

Fried broiled with basil, taste em, crack the legs

way out of formation, it's horizontal how I have em

fuckin me in the Benz wagon

Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon

Grab your gun it's on though

Shit is grimy, real niggaz buck in broad daylight

with the broke Mac it won't spray right

Don't give a fuck who they hit, as long as the drama's lit

I peeped you frontin, I was in the Jeep

Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin

Across the streat you was wildin

Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine

Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine

I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him

What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time

Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him

So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb

Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son

Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come

Then they came askin me my name, what the fuck

I got stitched up and went through

Left the hospital that same night, what

Got my gat back, time to backtrack

I had to drop so how the fuck I get clapped

Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by

It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one

That clown nigga's through, blazin at his crew daily

The 'Bridge touched me up severely hear me?

So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours

Be lightin L's sippin Coors, on all floors in project halls

Contemplatin war niggaz I was cool with before

We used to score together, Uptown coppin the raw

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square

Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear

Nothin on my mind but the dime sack we blazed

with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave

dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts

Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print

Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty

I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty

For real G, I'ma fullfill my dream

If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream

the first trip without the clique

Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it

Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes

I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes

God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million

without the FBI catchin feelings

From fat cat to papi, niggaz see the cat

Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back

Holdin gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back

Livin with moms, gettin it on, flushin crack down the toilet

Two sips from bein alcoholic

Nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein rich but now I'm all for it

My man saw it like Dionne Warwick

A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with

The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 

Up in the hotel, smokin on sessamina

Trina got the fishscale between her

The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her

She got me back livin sweeter, fresh Caesar

Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins

Bitches blow me while hoppin in the drop-top BM

Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

Growin up project-struck, lookin for luck dreamin

Scopin the large niggaz beamin, check what I'm seein

Cars, ghetto stars pushin ill Europeans

G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n

Young, early 80's, throwin rocks at the crazy lady

Worshippin every word them rope rockin niggaz gave me

The street raised me up, givin a fuck

I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was livin it up

I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody

Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty

Ain't that funny? Gettin put on to crack money

With all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry

A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years

Some niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career

But I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt

With Jeeps tinted out, spendin never holdin out

Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggaz just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me right?

Like I'm a f... I'm a gun, shit

It's like I'm a motherfuckin gun

I can't believe this shit...

Word up... (word up)



I seen some cold nights and bloody days

They grab and me bullets spray

They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day

My body is cold steel for real

I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed

Under car seats they sneak me in clubs

Been in the hands of mad thugs

They feed me when they load me with mad slugs

Seventeen precisely, one in my head

They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead

I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns

Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, livin harshly

Beat up and battered, they pull me out

I watch as niggaz scattered, makin me kill

But what I feel it never mattered

When I'm empty I'm quiet, findin myself fiendin to be fired

A broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves

Under beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred

Keep me full up with hollow heads



How you like me now? I go blaow

It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul

I might have took your first child

Scarred your life, crippled your style

I gave you power

I made you buck wild



How you like me now? I go blaow

It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul

I might have took your first child

Scarred your life, crippled your style

I gave you power

I made you buck wild



Always I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip

The barrel is my dick, uncircumcised

Pull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me

Results of what happens to niggaz shock me

I see niggaz bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears

Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years

I've been used in robberies, givin niggaz heart to follow me

Placin peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed

I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade

Met a wrecked-up tech with numbers on his chest that say 

Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero

Had a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place

Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him

Tired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun

But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on

I make myself jam right in my owner's hand



How you like me now? I go blaow

It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul

I might have took your first child

Scarred your life, crippled your style

I gave you power

I made you buck wild



How you like me now? I go blaow

It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul

I might have took your first child

Scarred your life, crippled your style

I gave you power

I made you buck wild



Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised

Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides

Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine

There's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin

Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear

He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career

Yo, I can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf

His eyes bubblin, he said, ""It was on""

I felt his palm troubled him shakin

Somebody stomped him out, his dome was achin

He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waitin

My creation was for blacks to kill blacks

It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin niggaz memories

But this time, it's done intentionally

He walked me outside, saw this cat

Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""

He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong

Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for 'im

He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood

Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge

What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt

A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase

My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast

I didn't know he was hit, it's over with

Heard mad niggaz screamin, niggaz runnin, cops is comin

Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me

Damn!"

It's just the likeness, of Isrealites mist, that made me write this
A slight twist, of lime rhyme, be chasin down your prime time
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan, features the freak shit, my thesis

on how we creep quick, fuckin your wife that ain't so secret

It's mandatory - see that pussy, they hand it to me

I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story

There ain't no drama that my niggaz never handle for me

My gator brand is Maurry, walkin through rough land before me

where the snakes put a smile on they face, hopin and prayin I'm stuck

Scopin they lay in the cut, weighin my luck

Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages

Winkin at some females cops with cocked gauges

Really it's papers I'm addicted to, wasn't for rap then I'll be stickin you

The mag inside the triple goose

Face down on the floors, the routine

Don't want hear nobody blow steam, just cream or it's a smoke screen

Imagine that - that's why I hardly kick the braggin raps

I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant

Crime infected, drivin a Lexus with a death wish

Boppin to Mona Lisa brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa

CD crankin, doin ninety on the Franklin-D-Roosevelt

No seat belt, drinkin and thinkin

My man caught a bad one son, niggaz is frightened

Secret indictments, adds on to one seekin enlightment

My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow

traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo

My ""Fuck Tommorrow"" motto through the eyes of Pablo

Escobar the desperado - word to Cus D'Amato

Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow

Three ki's, new V's, went to Anguilla with your hoe

Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat, gettin the dough

Them old timers, advise you to them problems that's ahead

Drama with the Feds, not listenin just bobbin your head

Your Roley shinin, thinkin to yourself nobody's takin mine

At the same time, your hoe is gettin snatched from behind

Put in the van, where's the hundred grand, script in her hand

From all the ice, wouldn't you know -

- you knew these niggaz all your life

What made them mark you victim, you fucked up somehwere down the line

now they had to target your Wisdom

She took em to your place, straight to your safe

You doubted it could happen sick of yappin

Dump in your ride, headed to your side

Puffin ganja get to your crib, can't find her

Just a reminder shit and have your stash house where you crash out

Coulda passed out, your coke was gone, now you assed out

Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up

Mafioso, gettin niggaz wigs sprayed up

Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy

I'll one day walk into shots drunk off champange from Sicily

This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma

Wise men build and destroy

While the real McCoy dopefiend, named Detroit is still dealin boy

Coke suppliers actin biased

But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired

I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's --

Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler

Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow

Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those

Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it? 

My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses

but impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills

Countin bills to send to all my jail niggaz who fell

From New York to L.A., Q.B. to C.P.T. for G.P.

A hundred G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars

Kani shit, mad jiggy

The clout, murder material serial scratched out

My name's passed out like it's somethin venereal

but back in stereo



[Chorus]



[Nas]

From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface

I bit the fruit from the Serpent

Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted

Control the rap game you got it twisted

Dr. Dre way the 'Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it

Sip Crist', push the six with biscuit

Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all, Nas y'all

Fly gangsta, wavy hair teeth chipped in

My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk, links truck

rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it

Rap hero, black DeNiro

Federal Bureau, tapped my line and got zero

Rap pro, diamond roll, hustlin low -

pro-file, white gold style, rakin bloody dough by the pile

Shot down, still alive he strugglin for the phone

Fo'-fo' blow him, when homicide comes, these three words are sung



[Chorus 2X]



[Dre]

Check this out

It's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre

Hahaha, East meets West

That's how we makin it happen

That's how it goes down for the nine-six

Aiyyo Nas let's get this money

Let's get paid

Sit back and watch all these motherfuckin clowns out here

riffin and beefin about this BULLSHIT

Yo, heh

While they doin all that

we just gon' kick back with these honies, this Cristal

Hah, and party to the year 2G



[Chorus]



[Dre - speaking over chorus]

Hehehe, that's right, that's right

Yeah, Nasty Nas, Dr. Dre

Wicked niggaz man



[AZ the Visualiza]

Yo, sit back relax catchin contacts, sip your cog-nac

And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat

Sneak attack, a new cat sit back, worth top dollar

In fact, touch mines, and I'll react like a Rottweiler

Who pull the late, we play for high stakes at gunpoint

Catch em and break, undress em tie em with tape, no escape

The Corleone, fettucini Capone

Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome

We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown

Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get blown

Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats

See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black



[Cormega]

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss

That nigga Paulie gotta die - he too soft

That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin, they found his head on

the couch with his dick in his mouth, I put the hit out

Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me

And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies

Yo my people from Medina they will see you

when you re-up on your heater all your cream go betweeen us

Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip

I chill with, niggaz that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks

My red beam, made a dread scream, and sprayed a Fed team

Corleone be turnin niggaz to fiends

Yukons and ninja black Lexus, 'Mega the pretty boy

with mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it



[Nas]

Yo, my mind is seein through your design like blind fury

I shine jewelry sippin on crushed grapes, we lust papes

and push cakes inside the casket at Just wake

It's sickenin, he just finished biddin upstate

And now the projects, is talkin that somebody gotta die shit

It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique

My man Smoke, know how to expand coke, and Mr. Coffee

Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me

""Life's a Bitch,"" but God-forbid the bitch divorce me

I'll be flooded with ice so hellfire can't scorch me

Cuban cigars meetin Foxy at Demars

Movin cars, your top papi Senor Escobar



[Foxy Brown]

In the black Camaro

Firm deep all my niggaz hail the blackest sparrow

Wallabee's be the apparel

Through the darkest tunnel, I got visions of multimillions

in the biggest bundle, in the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle

He money bags got Moet, Sean Don

Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do

My whole team we shittin hard like Czar

Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega, and Escobar

I keep a fat marquis piece, laced in all the illest snake skin

Armani sweaters Carolina Hebrera

Be The Firm baby, from BK to the 'Bridge

My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is

I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies

Sittin on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uhh!

We stay incogni' like all them thug niggaz in Marcy

The Gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi

Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan

On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Papa Chula spoke

Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke

Raw though, an ounce mixed wit leak that's pure though

Flippin the bigger picture, the bigger nigga with the cheddar

Was mad dripper, he had a fuckin villa in Manilla

We got to flee to Panama, but wait it's half and half

Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip

Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half, get sixteen, double it times three

We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream

Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight

We back to sixteen, now add the other two that 'Mega bringin through

So let's see, if we flip this other key

Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak

Plus a five hundred, cut in half is two-fifty

Now triple that times three, we got three quarters of another ki

The Firm baby, volume one uhh.."

My mindset, son got wet, I'm vexed really

They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly

Why niggaz actin illy word to Will he bout to feel it

I feel it, he shoulda been dealt wit it

Them niggaz sour, they put to much flour in they coke

And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE

While we was gleamin, niggaz was scheamin

Seen the ill Beamers beamin

Triple-beam and doublin cream, had em feenin

to get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa

Sosa, these niggaz hit the God, bring the toaster

Meet me in the 'Bridge I'm bout to go loca

Left my 'rat beggin me to stay and stroke her

He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious

wit two macs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober

I need some Henn' to bend me over

My nigga Hav got a soldier

It's gettin down it's goin down kid (I got this, I got this)

I heard he might not live, I'm holdin back tears

Told these broads, to put it in gear 

with two females that don't smile diggin they style yo

Whattup son, these niggaz done started somethin wild

You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill

Tried to get a name holdin the steel, I paid attention to the females

Maintain bitches when it get real

Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal

He said both hoes'll peel, spray shots and reload

and still handle the wheel, point em out smoke a Phil' then chill

I layed back Escobar status, knowin The Firm got it cornered

We on it, shit we was born wit

I knew he'd be right here, I told ya

Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova

Polo pullover, big links and rockin boulders

He's stuntin, after he left my man like that

without a fair chance to fight back, BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK

He never seen us, Sos' gave the mac to Venus

and Vicious, lookin delicious, handle yo' bidness

and step to him, shake yo' ass try to screw him

Do what ya gotta do to get to him

A tight parasuco, with young faces

can turn niggaz Buttafuco, of all ages, they was amused

by the way they walked, way they talked

Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York

if they had to, heard him ask Venus, ""Could I have you?""

He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him, ""Don't grab Boo""

They started chattin, was only bout a minute, flat when

they jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin

We followed them pollyin, he thought the hoes were Somalian

Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn

I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them

We layed low about a hour or so, these bitches movin too slow

We both holdin, what if them wild hoes started foldin? 

Sosa, said say no more, we started rollin

Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin

There the girls go, hurry up we out in

A young wild beautiful love child

You like them thug style link rockin, then mink coppin

Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin

The head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine

Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick

You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit

Chanel lookin real, airbrushed nails

Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)

To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me

The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me

Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle 

way too many Willies all in one hand

You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on

Niggaz pull your hair, shake your fat rear

Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there

But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars

Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out

Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas

Niggaz thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave

What up mah, frontin like you naive

Pusherman's whip, callin police when you flip

Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us

But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!



[Chorus: JoJo Hailey]



Diamonds all shinin, lookin all fine

Pretty little face, get a little high

Young girl stugglin, tryin to survive

Mother of the Earth, she made you and I

Just tired of playin the same ol' games

Messin with my mind, emotional thangs

And there goes.. a black girl.. lost



[Nas]

Like Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless

Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest

to who'sever gettin down and trifless

To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless

Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs

More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)

There you go again, startin wars, makin me more yours

Seem to get a kick out of keepin me on all fours

Face glistenin, I'm addicted to you

Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you

Igloos of ice trickin on you, you never listen 

to this nigga spendin Franklins on tennis anklets

Must've had a bad deal in the past though

Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow

Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain

You got a job part-time and school's your night thing

With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now

You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin screwed

Typical day that the black girl sees

Comin home wantin more from a college degree



[Chorus]



[Nas]

Where are you focused, on legit niggaz and where the coke is

Nice and Thug Life niggaz, yo you seem hopeless

Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you

could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin to

more than the world, but not knowin nothin about you

You leavin the crib, takin all your kids out to

drop them off, lettin some nigga knock you off

So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)

Growin up seein it, it should remind you, you bein lied to

Everything that move be inside you

Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you

I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to

They spot you out dancin topless in your drawers

Damn look, there goes a black girl lost

The way you hang out all night long

Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like ""Fuck,

I heard some bird whisper, ""Yo he should have ducked""

I puffed the lilla, just before I hit the scene for rilla

I'm all high it's late I'm looking down at the fella

Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion

His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk

It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder

that the street's designed to stop your life, plot

The beast in time yeah, cell to cell suspect ass nigga you fell

First time locked in crime stop my mind blocks the frail

Bursting blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell

We roll with no regrets, destiny's, fifty's and equities

My pants hang low while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly

Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese

Rollin two Phillies together make blunts Siamese

I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of

early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards

Trapped us in a cracker psychiatric, it's massive

A Million Man March, alert the masses

Ten glocks, Armani in small print, upon my glasses

Don assassins, armageddon, the wettin'

Never freakin the beast, seven heads, got the righteous threatened

Comprehend the grammar, Manfrione -- are you the type of nigga

to shoot a leg to get your name known? I flip the brain tome

I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin for Rambo, the cop who got grazed

Back in the days, chasin niggaz through my project maze

That cop he got a death wish

He run behind niggaz until you breathless

Everyday he makin ten arrests, sheeit

My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with

I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it

(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)

Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum

to check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar

Vetacini summer gear, she push the two-seater

I heard she brag about the way he eat her

A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba

She do be lookin weaker, now her teeth are foul

Speakin loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud

Fat ass dissolvin, like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin

Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron

I heard she let Jake investigate from her window 

cause she's a nympho, suckin dick and coughin up info

So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up

I know he vest up, we blazin from the neck up

They had the chains on, son hit the lock first

We busted in the cop jerked

Jungle popped one in his shirt

I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth

We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors

They eyein us (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)

Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now

There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now

Two in the dome, he's laid down, aiyyo the bitch is saved now

She's living in a snitch grave now

Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn

We can watch the tape play back and just zone

Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions

We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter

Music was loud and it was crowded

Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted

And Frank tried to stop the bank loss, about what a Roley cost

Guzzled his drink, and staggered off

He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own the hill

Couldn't take losin his cash, and I could feel

somethin in the air yeah, Frank returned with Pierre

A gun slinger, who niggaz hadn't seen in a year

I usually be holdin - 'specially this type of weekend

And everyone except for me had started reachin

They had gats in each others faces, with kids

and grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper

My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggaz jet off

Police blitz quick, waitin for that to set off

Runnin the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots

Startin shit in my hood, I can't have it

Yo High, get the 40-cali stainless, Jake is still out

Let's make it real and still make them niggaz famous

Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave

Life..... I wonder....
Will it take me under.... I don't know
Verse One: Nas



Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin

Imagine going to court with no trial

Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters

No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters

Days are shorter, nights are colder

Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra

The world's hot my son got not evidently

It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually

Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge

of coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars

Imagine everybody flashin, fashion

Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond vogues

Your people holdin dough, no parole

No rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers

Just some thoughts for the mind

I take a glimpse into time

watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""



Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas



If I ruled the world Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby

Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 

be mine, we'd both shine

If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in

these last days and times



Verse Two: Nas



The way to be, paradise like relaxin black, latino and anglo-saxon

Armani exchange the reins

Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last

Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path

The Villa house is for the crew, how we do

Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches

So many years of depression make me vision

The better livin, type of place to raise kids in

Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul

But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child

Seeing things like I was controlling, click rollin

Trickin six digits on kicks and still holdin

Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage

Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish

Political prisonner set free, stress free 

No work release purple M3's and jet skis 

Feel the wind breeze in West Indies

I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse themes to Willies

It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown

I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa



Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas



If I ruled the world Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby

Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 

be mine, we'd both shine

If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in

these last days and times



And then we'll walk right up to the sun

Hand in hand

We'll walk right up to the sun

We won't land

We'll walk right up to the sun

Hand in hand

We'll walk right up to the sun

We won't land



Verse Three: Nas



You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry

Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory

Runnin from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes

These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state

Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight

Tryin to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe

Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera

Makin moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler

Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich

Still nobody want a nigga havin shit

If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit

I push a Q-45 Infinit

It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies

Strictly living longevity to the destiny

I thought I'd never see but reality struck

Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck???



Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas



If I ruled the world Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, I love em em baby

Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 

be mine, we'd both shine

If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in

these last days and times



If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled Imagine that

I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled

I love em love em baby

Black diamonds and pearls, black dimaonds Could it be, if you could

black diamonds be mine, we'd both shine

If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in

these last days and times



If I ruled the world, if I ruled

if I ruled, I'd free all my sons

black diamonds, I love em love em baby

Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled

If I ruled the world



If I ruled the world

I love em love em baby!!"

[Verse One: AZ the Visualiza]

Visualizin the realism of life and actuality

Fuck who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary

And my mentality is, money orientated

I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it

cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters

But somethin must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners

Now some, restin in peace and some are sittin in San Quentin

Others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition

Keepin the schwepervesence street ghetto essence inside us

Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us

Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go

but as long as we leavin thievin we'll be leavin with some kind of dough

so, and to that day we expire and turn to vapors

me and my capers-ll be somewhere stackin plenty papers

Keepin it real, packin steel, gettin high

Cause life's a bitch and then you die



[Chorus: AZ the Visualiza]

Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high

Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye

Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high

Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye 

--> chorus #1 echoes at the end



Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Life's a bitch and then you die

--> chorus #2 includes these lines, echoes at the end



[Verse Two: Nas]

I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing

The essence of adolescent leaves my body now I'm fresh in

My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it

One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created

Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some

Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from

my skull cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain

Don't go against the grain simple and plain

When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard

Robbin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards

Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash

and got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash

Now it's all about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with

is rich or doin years in the hundreds

I switched my motto -- instead of sayin fuck tomorrow

That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto

Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks

I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back

Time is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric

Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage

I sip the Dom P, watching ""Gandhi"" 'til I'm charged

Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin

To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement

Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with

The thief's theme: play me at night, they won't act right

The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe

The mind activation, react like I'm facin' time like

""Pappy"" Mason, with pens I'm embracin'

Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets

Suede Timb's on my feets makes my cipher complete

Whether crusing in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep

I can't call it, the beats make me falling asleep

I keep falling, but never falling 6 feet deep

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)

To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life

I trip, we box up crazy bitches

Aiming guns at all my baby pictures

Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's

Yet I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul

The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child

Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled

Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle

There's no days, for broke days we sell it: smoke pays

While all the old folks pray to Jesus, soaking their sins in trays

Of holy water. Odds against Nas are slaughter

Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter

My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection

Born in correction. All the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction

""How you living?"" Large, a broker charge - cards are mediocre

You flipping coke or playing spit spades and strip poker?

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed

For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded

Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne

I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home

I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow

Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow

Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip

Picturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip

And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs

Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom

The crew is lamping, Big Willie-style

Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild

Stash through the flock wools, burning dollars to light my stove

Walk the blocks with a bop, checking dames, plus the games

People play, bust the problems of the world today"

Check me out y'all, Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
[Nas]
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts

Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt

You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer

That's like Malcolm X, catchin the Jungle Fever

King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major

Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager

Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass

40-side is the place that is givin me grace

Now wait, another dose and you might be dead

And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds

And ain't a damn thing gonna change

I'ma performer strange, so the mic warmer was born to gain

Nas, why did you do it?

You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime



(Right..) It's halftime

(Right..) Aiyyo it's halftime

(Right..) It's halftime

(Right..) Yeah, it's about halftime

This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel



[Nas]

It's like that, you know it's like that

I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back

When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back

So I react never calmly on a hype track

I set it off with my own rhyme

Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time

I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex

In ya, stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck

I used to hustle - now all I do is relax and strive

When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5

I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it

With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach

Nasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise

This is exercise 'til the microphone dies

Back in eighty-three I was an MC sparkin

But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and

kick my little raps cause I thought niggaz wouldn't understand

And now in every jam I'm the fuckin man

I rap in front of more niggaz than in the slave ships

I used to watch ""C.H.I.P.S."" now I load glock clips

I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic

Versatile, my style switches like a faggot

But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual

Of rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo

These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand

Cause in the streets, I'm well known like the number man

In my place wit the bass and format

Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that

And next time I rhyme, I be foul

Whenever I freestyle I see trial niggaz say I'm wild

I hate a rhymebiter's rhyme

Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime



(Right..) It's halftime

(Right..) Exhale, check it it's halftime

(Right..) It's halftime

(Right..) It's real in the field

Word life, check it



[Nas]

I got it goin on, even flip 'em on this song

Every afternoon, I kick half the tune

And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit

Word to Marcus Garvey I hardly sparked it

Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word

I be slayin them fast, doing this that and the third

But chill, past to Andre, and let's slay

I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee

Puttin hits on 5-0

Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo'-fo'

And biters can't come near

And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia

I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed

That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed

This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten

Brooklyn and Queens is livin fat and

The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout

Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out



(Right..) It's still halftime

(Right..) To the Queensbridge crew

To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime

(Right..) Ninety-two, it's halftime

(Right..) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost

I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners

Henessey holders and old school niggaz, then I be dissin a

unofficial that smoke woolie thai

I dropped out of Kooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie

Jungle survivor, fuck who's the liver

My man put the battery in my back, a differencem from Energizer

Sentence begins indented.. with formality

My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology

Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop

I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block

I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat

Childhood lesson make me see him drop in my weed smoke

It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines

The hype vice, murderous nighttimes, and knife fights invite crimes

Chill on the block with Cog-nac, hold strap

with my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap

No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace

For niggaz no sheisty vice to just snipe ya

Start off the dice-rollin mats for craps to cee-lo 

With sidebets, I roll a deuce, nothin below (Peace God!)

Peace God -- now the shit is explained

I'm takin niggaz on a trip straight through memory lane

It's like that y'all .. it's like that y'all .. it's like that y'all



Chorus: repeat scratches 4X



""Now let me take a trip down memory lane"" -> BizMarkie

""Comin outta Queensbridge""



[Nas]

One for the money

Two for pussy and foreign cars

Three for Alize niggaz deceased or behind bars

I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real or showbiz?

My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses

Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real

A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja

Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces

Your telephone blowin, black stitches or fat shoelaces

Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo'-fo' I let blow

and back down po-po when I'm vexed so

my pen taps the paper then my brain's blank

I see dark streets, hustlin brothers who keep the same rank

Pumpin for somethin, some uprise, plus some fail

Judges hangin niggaz, uncorrect bails, for direct sales

My intellect prevails from a hangin cross with nails

I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real

Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats

I decifer prophecies through a mic and say peace.

I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats

They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black

Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing

Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo

Fuck 'rap is real', watch the herbs stand still

Never talkin to snakes cause the words of man kill

True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins

I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

Whattup kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?

Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper

Flippin, talk about he acts too rough

He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff

I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too

Fucking with the niggaz from that fake crew that hate you

But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?

Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach - it's bugged

Plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime

Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9's

at night time there's more trife than ever

Whattup with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?

If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest

Say whassup to Herb, Ice and Bullet

I left a half a hundred in your commisary

You was my nigga when push came to shove

One what? one love



[Verse Two]

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong

Out in New York the same shit is goin on

the crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking

hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking

the nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something

word to mother, i heard him fronting

and he be pumping on your block

your man gave him your glock

and now they run together, what up son, whatever

since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease

but I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece

Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira

better chill cause them niggaz will put that ass on fire

Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers

but maintain when you come home the corner's ours

On the reels, all these crab niggaz know the deal

When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal

But chill, see you on the next V-I

I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks

Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me

he might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key

so stay civilised, time flies

though incarcerated your mind [dies]

I hate it when your mum cries

it kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a

I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love



[Verse Three]

Sometimes I sit back with a buddha sack

mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts

written in school text books, bibles, et cetera

Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er

So I be ghost from my projects

I take my pen and pad for the week and hittin L's while I'm sleepin

A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone

to relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home

You see the streets have me stressed somethin terrible

Fuckin with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue

or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10

a future in a maximum state pen is grim

So I comes back home, nobody's out but shorty doo-wop

Rollin two phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oowops

He said, ""Nas, niggaz could be bustin' off the roof

so I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce""

He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep

Started coughing one eye peeked to watch me speak

I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black

We was chillin' on these bitches where he pumped his loose cracks

I took an l when he passed it, this little bastard

keeps me blasted he starts talkin mad shit

I had to school him, told him don't let niggaz fool him

cause when the pistol blow the ones that's murdered be the cool one

Tough luck when niggaz are struck, families fucked up

Could've cought your man, but didn't look when you bucked up

Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up

at the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed

Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul

Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style

Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes

then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose

and told my little man that i'm a go cyprose

there's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose

words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above

keep an eye out for jake shorty what

Get murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggaz tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
who don't care, guzzlin beers, we all stare

at the out-of-towners (Ay, yo, yo, who that?) They better break North

before we get the four pounders, and take their face off

The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasin brothers

The D.A.'s on the roof, tryin to, watch us and knock us

And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters

I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for

the fronters, wannabe ill niggaz and spot runners

Thinkin it can't happen til I, trap em and clap em

and leave em done, won't even run about Gods

I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards

Nas is a rebel of the street corner

Pullin a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure



Represent, represent!! (repeat 4X)



Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella

Moet drinkin, marijuana smokin street dweller

who's always on the corner, rollin up blessed

When I dress, it's never nuttin less than Guess

Cold be walkin with a bop and my hat turned back

Love committin sins and my friends sell crack

This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue

The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one

cause life ain't shit but stress fake niggaz and crab stunts

So I guzzle my Hennesey while pullin on mad blunts

The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator

The type of nigga who be pissin in your elevator

Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game

Used to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames

Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs

Fly new chicKs and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's



Represent, represent!! (repeat 3X)



No doubt; see my, stacks are fat, this is what it's about

Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan

Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane

I used to wake up every mornin, see my crew on the block

Every day's a different plan that had us runnin from cops

If it wasn't hangin out in front of cocaine spots

We was at the candy factory, breakin the locks

Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man

Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand

Could use a gun Son, but fuck bein the wanted man

but if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam

Then call the crew to get live too

with Swoop, Hakim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow

Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit

My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it

It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs

Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, One Love



Represent y'all, represent!! (repeat 4X)



One time for your motherfuckin mind

This goes out to everybody in New York

that's livin the real fuckin life

And every projects, all over

To my man, Big Will he's still here *echoes*

The 40 side of Vernon

My man Big L.E.S.

Big Cee-Lo from the Don

Shawn Penn, the 40 busters

My crew the shorty busters

The 41st side of Vernon posse

The Goodfellas

My man Cormega, Lakid Kid

Can't forget Drawers, the Hillbillies

My man Slate, Wallethead

Black Jay, Big Oogi

Crazy barrio spot (Big Dove)

We rock shit, Ph.D

And my man Primo, from GangStarr

(Ninety-four real shit y'all, Harry O!)

Fuck y'all crab ass niggaz though...

(Yeah, bitch ass niggas! *etc.*)"

The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin

Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion

Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin

Cause in my physical, I can express through song

Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong

I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell

From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell



The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up

Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up

Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L

School a fool well, you feel it like braille

It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill

Vocabulary spills I'm +Ill+

plus +Matic+, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek

Jam like a tech with correct techniques

So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me

Scannin while you're plannin ways to sabotage me

I leave em froze like her-on in your nose

Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell



This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen

I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggaz is frozen

Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin

End like Leviathan, it's deep well let me try again

Wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop

I dominate break loops, givin mics men-e-straul cycles

Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle

And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova

You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra

Packin like a rasta in the weed spot

Vocals'll squeeze glocks, MC's eavesdrop

Though they need not to sneak

My poetry's deep, I never fell

Nas's raps should be locked in a cell

It ain't hard to tell"
