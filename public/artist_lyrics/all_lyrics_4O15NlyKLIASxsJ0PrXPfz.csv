Rockstar chain all the way to the floor, dawg

Ain't tryna be cool with no rap nigga, I'm fuckin' they ho, dawg

Took two Addys, then counted an M and damn near dozed off

I'm in the stars drivin' myself, I feel like autopilot

Designer Goyard bucket, I'm my own stylist

I done made it out the streets, my brothers still wildin'

Had to go Draco, Draco, Draco, all I could do about it

Soon as it come my way, I can't do nothin' but see about it



I'ma get me a B up out it, started with a milli'

Made it out the trenches, I can't ever plead guilty

Crushed her heart when she found out I crushed her friend

Played it smart 'cause either way, I gotta win

I wear my heart on my sleeve, they ain't real as me

We could've kept it way more cordial, but it's chemistry

You kept me over through the night and boost my energy

I'm thankin' you, I'm thankin' me for curiosity

Coolest thing to do is to be cool with a nigga and fuckin' on his bitch

I know niggas'd do it to me so I'm always gon' send that hit

She said she true and she said she loyal, that's how they come to me

I know what really turn you on and I'ma keep our secret

Started with a million dollars, go 'head and get me billi'

I'm from the trenches, so the clip least hold a fifty

Crushed ice, Cartier frames, or Chrome Hearts

Niggas ain't solid as they claim, so I play it smart

I'm changin' weather, I'm thinkin' better, I'm peepin' the energy

I left my heart in the streets, so ain't no sympathy

If you ain't with me, you against me, you the enemy

Playin' my cards, sittin' in the stars, this the life I lead

Coolest thing you could do is squash the beef and still send a hit

I know niggas'd do it to me, so I ain't gon' never stop a blitz

She say it's loyalty, no betrayal when it come to me

I know what really turn you on and I'ma keep a secret

Admit it, I move like amoeba

I float in the room like I'm reefer

Alien, I'm not your kind of people

Tell a telepathic fam how I read ya

You ain't got emeralds that's greener

You ain't got rich up the sleeve

And I got a Rolls that's in the Grove, that I ain't drove

Shit, I don't know the reason

Andele, andele, arriba

Me and J Balvin on G5

Success is a drug man, and we high

I am mother as a beehive

I got love for you haters

Ain't you tired of enslavement

Come with us, make some paper

'Cause you should own what you labor



Yeah, You never stayed in Kailua

I put chanel on my shooter

Flooded my chain and it's Gucci

I don't want that girl she moody

I'm basically saying that I'm cooler

Get Dior discounts from my cougar

Back in the six-grade I got them bad grades

I was in love with my tutor

See, musically, Lil Uzi trapping man

Most of you rappers be actors man

Go M.I.A when I find little madison

Stay at the Ritz-Carlton, this not the Radisson

Just took a blue one, 'bout to take the red pill

Purple thoughts in my brain, hope it don't spill

Stay with a nerd just like Urkel Jaleel

Fresh just like Carlton, I kill em with Will

Big ass ""R on my Smiths

Big ass R on my whip

Slip-on shoes, so you won't trip

Said she kinda fine if she got some hips

Momma said, ""Let me see the witch""

Boy you know light and dark don't mix

Mix it up, boy, bad luck

Sick to my stomach with them neon guts



Higher than Elon Musk

So high stars eat our dust

Pharrell on Mars with my fellow stars

I'm like lightning striking on a metal rod

Say ""Hello, God"" on the double bars

So dammit, Amex, I got a yellow card

Yellow card, yellow card

Damn, P, I need a yellow card

I am from The Root like where the petal start

I had to push like a pedal

Started way after but ahead of y'all

New crib, got a better yard

Two years, I got hella cars

Since the eighth grade had hella broads

Hella broads, hella broads

Yellow painting with a yellow broad

Shit came from cost, probably marge

Slick my hair back like I'm Chico DeBarge

I got some lights on my chest

Don't confuse it with a heart

Heard things ain't looking too good for you

Had to pull some strings like I play the harp

I get these billions alone

It been that way from the start

Smoking good kush, my cologne

Got neon guts 'cause I can't see in the dark



Higher than Elon Musk

So high stars eat our dust

And I got a colorful aura

Like I got neon guts

Dark energy, we don't touch

Our jewelry be on tut

Alien, I'm not your kind of people

Tell a telepathic fam how I read ya

You ain't got emeralds that's greener

You ain't got rich up the sleeve

And I got a Rolls that's in the Grove, that I ain't drove

Shit, I don't know the reason

Andele, andele, arriba

Me and J Balvin on G5

Success is a drug man, and we high

I am mother as a beehive

I got love for you haters

Ain't you tired of enslavement

Come with us, make some paper

'Cause you should own what you labor



Yeah, You never stayed in Kailua

I put chanel on my shooter

Flooded my chain and it's Gucci

I don't want that girl she moody

I'm basically saying that I'm cooler

Get Dior discounts from my cougar

Back in the six-grade I got them bad grades

I was in love with my tutor

See, musically, Lil Uzi trapping man

Most of you rappers be actors man

Go M.I.A when I find little madison

Stay at the Ritz-Carlton, this not the Radisson

Just took a blue one, 'bout to take the red pill

Purple thoughts in my brain, hope it don't spill

Stay with a nerd just like Urkel Jaleel

Fresh just like Carlton, I kill em with Will

Big ass ""R on my Smiths

Big ass R on my whip

Slip-on shoes, so you won't trip

Said she kinda fine if she got some hips

Momma said, ""Let me see the witch""

Boy you know light and dark don't mix

Mix it up, boy, bad luck

Sick to my stomach with them neon guts

So dammit, Amex, I got a yellow card

Yellow card, yellow card

Damn, P, I need a yellow card

I am from The Root like where the petal start

I had to push like a pedal

Started way after but ahead of y'all

New crib, got a better yard

Two years, I got hella cars

Since the eighth grade had hella broads

Hella broads, hella broads

Yellow painting with a yellow broad

Shit came from cost, probably marge

Slick my hair back like I'm Chico DeBarge

I got some lights on my chest

Don't confuse it with a heart

Heard things ain't looking too good for you

Had to pull some strings like I play the harp

I get these billions alone

It been that way from the start

Smoking good kush, my cologne

Got neon guts 'cause I can't see in the dark

I fuck with my same hoes I don't trust these niggas

990 that's the nubies ya

Smoked that boy like he is a loosie ya

On the Xan, hear a noise I load it up



All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us

Literally I'm cold as fuck

I need Canadian Goose

I need to get a Moncler

Diamonds so cold need some soup



Driving around in a what

Saint Laurent all on my boots

Saint Laurent all on my boo

2000 dollar a tooth

Lil Uzi you is the truth

Lil Uzi you is the truth

If you think they took my chain, boy you is a fool

I said boy you a fool

I just caught me a Mewtwo

I just caught me a Mewtwo (Mew)

Japanese girl stuck to me just like some glue



All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us

Literally I'm cold as fuck

I need Canadian Goose

I need to get a Moncler

Diamonds so cold need some soup



Diamonds all on my teeth so I barely can talk

Money all in my pockets so I barely can walk

Diamonds they shine in the dark

She from LA but she live in New York

But I ain't worried about that

Worried about busting them traps

Lil Uzi ya you know I be smoking that pack

If she gon' leave then you know she coming right back

In a Cadillac do a drive by with a Mac

When I walk in none of these hoes can relax

When I walk in know that I move with the racks

When I walk in know that I move with the racks

Came right in put my city on my back

But I'm still so relaxed on a Xanax

I don't care what you did, don't love you less

But it's still Margiela all on my vest

What a cross on my neck

I just flew to the A

I might go to MIA

I ain't talking paper planes

On the block with all my chains

Got the money and the fame

You a lame that's a shame



All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us

Literally I'm cold as fuck

I need Canadian Goose

I need to get a Moncler

Diamonds so cold need some soup"

Wake up every day, know that I am blessed

[Verse 1]

Driving like I stole it

Double parking bitch you better not tow it

Please show me my opponent

I said please show me my opponent

I'm so young I could fuck on your niece

Walk on your knees

Driving my car and that bitch ain't no lease

I am a beast

Look at my pockets they so obese

They so obese

I eat up like its at a feast

Yeezy my feet

I put Louie V, Don C my wrists

Ferragamo, that's all on my wrists

I know that girl can really suck dick

Cause she talk to me right with a lisp

I pour lean up right that's so crisp

She suck like a tick

I got paper nigga and you know it

I swear to God I really can't miss

I make hits I really can't miss

Even if I miss that shit'll hit

Stack my money then watch as it flip

Spend my money then do it again

I swear to God she a ten

Keep her around I swear that girl she a gem

Before I was on, fucked on the twins

Before I was on, fucked on the twins

Raf Simons, Rick Owens, little Phillip Lim

She said she ain't want me, so I fucked her friend

Open up my mouth white diamonds when I grin

I am not from this earth like Invader Zim

Nowadays, I am on everybody kin

Walk around with my Barbie like I am Ken

Everyday adventure time feel like I'm Finn

I might just put some diamonds all on my wrist

Every bitch in my face don't give 'em kiss

Boy you hate cause you can't live your life like this

Don't want to sit on the dick then just stand bitch

Stepping in Margiela you can't walk my way

Diamonds on my teeth don't talk my way

What do you want with me?

Yah, yah, yah
Yaaahhh, yahhh, yah
Nena no estás sola
Llamaste a mi teléfono y contesté

Ella contesta y lo deja caer lento

Mantenlo en lo bajo



Por lo que escuché ella tiene un hombre en casa

Yo voy profundo pero estoy cansado de esperar

Tengo una situación

Vivo mi doble vida increíble



No puedo ir un día si no hablo con mi nena

Fui por mi capucha todos mis amigos piensan que lo hice

hablo con mi familia, hombre mi madre cree que soy famoso

Sí mi madre cree que soy famoso



Billetes de cien dólares en el camino

Sí se siente bien ser estupendo



Si ahora ella tiene que hacer lo que digo

Si ahora ella tiene que hacer lo que digo

Cuento mi masa, lo hago apilar

Gasté en ella, lo hago de nuevo

Lo que me dijiste, no puedo tomarlo devuelta

Lo que te dije, no puedo tomarlo devuelta



No puedo ir un día si no hablo con mi nena

Fui por mi capucha todos mis amigos piensan que lo hice

hablo con mi familia, hombre mi madre cree que soy famoso

Sí mi madre cree que soy famoso



Regla numero uno, tiene que obtener todo su papel

Estoy en una zona, no puedo ver a ningún hater

Cuando no estoy cerca no sé lo que dice

Ella dice sola pero ella sabe ella realmente tomó

No me importa en absoluto

Regla número uno, nunca confíes en zorras

Paseo alrededor de LA en un Range Rover

Radio blasting, escuchando a Dej Loaf



Billetes de cien dólares en el camino

Sí se siente bien ser estupendo

Si ahora ella tiene que hacer lo que digo

Si ahora ella tiene que hacer lo que digo

Cuento mi masa, lo hago apilar

Gasté en ella, lo hago de nuevo

Radio blastin', escuchando a Dej Loaf
