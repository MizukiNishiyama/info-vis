Ain't one that don't wanna dance

She took off with the Federales, and I took all the blame

Thought I was strong enough

Got a lot of shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus



Stumblin' down the corridor, came across an open door

Throwin' up is easy, and who put on the Commodores?

That's a nice tile floor, wish I got to know you more

Who am I talkin' to? Nobody

Take me outside, I'm a little too high

Paid a little too much for the time of my life

When the money ain't a problem, everyone's slidin'

Even when I tell myself that I—



Don't want to sober up

The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it ""Mourning""

Thought I was strong enough

Threw my bottle at the sky, said ""God, that's a warning""

Don't wanna sober up

Try to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it

Thought I was strong enough

Got a lot of shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus"

And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies zipped to Houston

Cars and clothes thought I was winning, you knew I was losing

You told me to wake up, oh my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done



To each their own and found peace in knowing

Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping

Show no emotion, against the cold

And just act as hard as you can

You don't need a friend, boy you're the man



Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo



And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from

It seems like every plug we needs to Utah, became Mormons Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on

So what, ugh

I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do with it

I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune and

Lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance

Drank more

And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies zipped to Houston

Cars and clothes thought I was winning, you knew I was losing

You told me to wake up, oh my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done



To each their own and found peace in knowing

Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping

Show no emotion, against the cold

And just act as hard as you can

You don't need a friend, boy you're the man



Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo



And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from

It seems like every plug we needs to Utah, became Mormons Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on

So what, ugh

I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do with it

I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune and

Lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance

Drank more



To each their own and found peace in knowing

Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping

Show no emotion, against the cold

And just act as hard as you can

You don't need a friend, boy you're the man
