You about the dollar

My life in the spotlight

Oh no no no, I ain't even got to talk about it, talk about it

Tell these motherfuckers we don't even wanna talk about it, what



I don't know everything

But one thing, one thing I do know

One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)

Is one day I'ma have everything

It was all a dream

It was all a dream

I want it all



I just bought California

Them other states ain't far behind it either

I remember selling instrumentals off a beeper

Nigga never afford headphones or the speakers

I was getting money 'fore the internet

Still got Eminem checks I ain't opened yet

MVP shit, this is where the trophies at

D-R-E, this is where the dope is at

The world ain't enough, I want it all

God dammit, I'm too old, I forgot I got it all

But Andre young enough to still get involved

And Andre still young enough to say fuck y'all

Fuck you, fuck you, and you on the corner too

If you wanna beef, make sure that's somethin' you wanna do

With some people that must have felt that way too



I don't know everything

But one thing, one thing I do know

One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)

Is one day I'ma have everything

It was all a dream

What the fuck was y'all thinking?

You let the wrong young nigga lean with a legend

'Lotta new niggas talking crazy on the records

I'm the only king here, you can tell 'em that I said it

I'm the black Eminem, I'm the humbler 50

I'm D.O.C., who do it better? Nobody fuckin' with me

I murder rappers everyday, til' police come and get me

And Dre just come and bail me out and then we hit the studio

Ain't no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas

Emotional every song, deserve to have fresh niggas

Cry about my old girl, but ain't how I left niggas

Try and get my Xbox, Red Ring of Death niggas

I'm Kanye raising the diamond every day in the chain

If this was you, your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraisal

I'm just talking reckless, I'm just off the record

But I mean it, kept my blessings

We was dreaming, now we close enough to see it



I don't know everything

But one thing, one thing I do know

One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)

Is one day I'ma have everything

It was all a dream

It was all a dream

I want it all

I've been tryna get it all

I'm just in this bitch, I'ma show em how to get involved

Yeah I want everything, yeah I want everything

Reload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays

That's one on the left and one in the right hand, Scottie Pippen both ways

Been doin' drive-bys, got this music industry timelined

Lookin' like Rosecrans when these niggas throw up them signs high

I'm talkin' about that bottom where it's hot grinds

Shit, I'm just tryna get paid and keep em thighs high

Sometimes I feel like I could just bury em, bury 'em

Cause delirium, mass hysteria, scarier area

I'm very aware that hip hop needed somethin' to carry it

So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot

Hangin' way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier

This is hub city nigga, don't make us embarrass you

Ahh, recognize whatever side the sides reside until the dead has risen

Live in a project building, dodgin' the module ceilings

I ride, I'mma ride in a stolen jeep

Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)

Mama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)

My family's ties, had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (abducted)

My aliens on surveillance, they payed me a visit (Disgusting)

Our stadium's packed, raiders in black

Curls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap

I lie on the side of a one way street

Nowhere to go, death all I can see

I say ""Fuck is up?"", I fuck 'em up, your supper's up or somethings up

I hoping all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch broke

Plenty ruckus with the weapon I protect it under oath

My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life

Fuck your hope, fuck your mama

Fuck your daddy, fuck you dead homie

Fuck the world up when we came up, that's Compton homie!

It's kind of funny how they fall back on me

I used to never get a call back, homie

Before the money they didn't see me like it's dark and it's all black, homie

But now they switching cause the card black, homie

It wasn't always that way

We was recording on the 4-track, homie

New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable

And all I hear is my girl in my ear

And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie

I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie

What it came to be, would have never believed, living the life I lived in C-P-T

A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that, homie



It was something to me

No eat, no sleep, wasn't nothing to me

Can't always be how you want it to be

That's just the way it is, and how it always was

DJing parties in my neighborhood just for the love

Dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping

And any minute niggas start tripping and start shooting shit

On any given day I'm like ""what the fuck?""

Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs

Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up

And now it's ""Fuck the Police"" all up in the club

Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit

And was like ""What up cuz? Let me show you what this chronic like""

Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life

And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in (woo!)

This one of those dreams you don't wake up from

Then again, you don't sleep if you come from where I come from

When the sun shines and they bust nines

Don't dial 9 plus 1-1

When they run up on your school bus with a two truck, you might learn something

I mean it's got a lot of firepower. If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you, that's very powerful. I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy, just to do as well as the next guy. And to do better than the next guy, I had to just kill. And you know, to a certain extent, that's still with me in how I work, you know, I just... go in
Sittin' 'bout a hundred stories up, like what the fuck?
And I'm just lookin' at it all
I'll be right here in Los Angeles
Lookin' like a villain layin' low

Nothin' I can do but pack it all up

Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love

Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight

Actin' a fool and feelin' alive

I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault

Only type of livin' I know



See if it was you you would've killed yourself by now

It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this

And they ask me how I do it

Mothafucka just take a look around

Best believe I'm in the buildin' I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that but uh

No, no don't mention me at all

Yeah comin' live and direct

And I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh

Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin'

I thought it was all good

But now you mothafuckas crossed the line

Kinda pissin' me off

All the fans and all the fame, and though I gave everything to this game

They still complain

Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?

There's so much fuckin' pressure

There's all this pressure

And it's all in a day's work



Work, hard

Workin' so hard

24/7, 3-6-5

365, hard work

It's all in a day's work



My whole life all I ever thought about was grindin'

Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence

That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus

And that was back when I felt like rappers was true mothafuckin' riders

Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster

Shit I was still sayin', ""Fuck the police""

Born and raised in the belly of the beast

I had a dream that we was at peace

But I was so wrong.. so wrong

Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias

Now reality TV talks about pulpits and choirs

Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us

It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton sick and tired

Some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate

These bitches thinkin' fame first

I can't knock the hustle, it's all in a day's work

But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse

Shit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse

They just thirst



Hard times

I'm on my grind, fuck the part-time

Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line

I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine

It's becoming the only feeling I know

Only type of livin' I know

Only type of livin' I know

Only type of livin' I know

Only type of livin' I know



Gonna go to work

We gotta work

We gotta work

Let's get back to work

On the grind, back to work



Let's work

Rich as fuck, but, guess what, I'm back to work

Overseas, back home, no time to sleep, I'm back to work

So many people that I love, they want my time but I got to work

Some of my friends don't understand I got to work

Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like, ""Fuck that I gotta work""

If you really wanna do it like this, shit you better get back to work

Back to work

Right back to work

Gotta get back to work

Shit, right back to work"

For every one of you, there's a hundred more

And I watch them come and go, my track record ain't coincidental

And these verses is like hearses

Consistently killin' y'all with instrumentals

Tell me, fuck what would y'all do without me?!

Kill yourself for even thinking something crazy 'bout me

I'm like Ali, your fuckin' champ, now watch me rope a dope

Just watch him choke, cause everythin' I drop is dope

Now watch 'em all go up in smoke



I came here to raise hell, I can't lie

One shot, one kill, it's real, I ain't hidin'

Don't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die

And never get it fucked up, I got shooters for hire

Cause you don't want it, I have you like aye aye

Better back the fuck up, over guns so I try

Now that weak shit will never slide, I despise

You are now not in the presence of nice guys



Look, what the fuck, I was just chillin' in the cut

Ain't no beginners, only winners run amok, you runners up

You funny fuck like twenty bucks, I know your slut will let me fuck

I told my city ""Hold me down,"" now look how high they hold me up

I'm Kobe clutch, I hold my nuts 'fore I was old enough to cuss

Was kissin' bitches after lunch, now that's a muthafuckin' rush

So by high school I was fuckin' niggas' bitches on the hush

So no questions and no panties is a muthafuckin' must

It's the people's rapper, I ain't no rapper, I'm the rapture

On the mornin' after, you lackin' passion, you ain't rap

You just a wack distraction, I can't relax cause I feel the magic smashin'

Toni Braxton, where your sisters at? Let's get it crackin' (Bo!)

Look, I was young, I was broke, had no hope, so I wrote

That's how I cope, I went hard with no results

New approach, same truth, just get ready, aim, shoot

Then get buried, bang, woof, so they better bring troops

Because...

It's fuckin' murder, baby

I'm tryna hurt 'em, baby

I know you heard me, baby

Feel like I'm goin' crazy

It's fuckin' murder, baby

Run, run, run, the cops almost got me

Another tear drop, another motherfuckin' body

Uh, uh, uh, another fuckin' body

Uh, uh, uh, another body

Just the other day, I saw a hologram of Eazy around my way

I started to pray, I hopped up in that Maybach

I know I said I wouldn't but sometimes a nigga gotta crossover like A.I

I crossover like Steph Curry, crossover like CP

But I will not crossover so niggas can buy the CD

This NWA ha, smokin' that Bombay, we stay high

Niggas is killin', we out the way ha

I think about the day I first met Dre

I got my Aftermath Chain, I iced out the A

I stayed on some gangsta shit but still bump that De La

Dippin' down Green Leaf, Cherry Six Tre

I felt like I ain't need your love, wrote the song ""Hittin' Switches"", then I recorded the shit with Faith

I did the BET Awards with Mary J

I stayed on top of California like the bay niggas



Just the other day I

Seen a Compton hat and it reminded me of Eazy

Just the other day I

Had a dream that I did some more G Shit with Nate Dogg

Shout-out to the Bay, bruh

Cause my niggas drivin' down with Chronic to LA

Where that Alize now?

Cause a nigga wanna trip, got the thing on my waist side?



Shout to my niggas up in Wayside

Take these Amber Rose pictures, send up 'em the way

I love my niggas, especially in the pen

I hold you down if I never see you again

I put that on my kids

I sweat them blood tears

I trade places with you, and do some of your years

I confronted my fears

I roll up a fat one and disappear on the pier

I wish you niggas was here and

Just the other day I, was riding through the old hood

Feelin' like the old Suge, me and my city both good

I understand I've been misunderstood

Niggas hate me cause they wishin' they could

Kill me, put my face on obituaries when I was just in they hood

Keepin' they bitches in missionary positions now look

Don't ever ask me about Dre I, been 100 with my niggas since the day I, signed to the Math and

Flint nigga in the spot til they pop one and the cops come like (woo!)

Motherfuckers own a shotgun like a pop gun and they ready like yeah

Still a good nigga I'm a Northside nigga til I'm gone

Do it for the ones in the hood like Connor gon' put the city on

Fuck that shit nigga, fuck that shit go

Ride for the hood, gotta spit it like Pac

I ain't got shit but I still feel good

Nigga can't take what a nigga don't got

Go hard in the paint, you can tell em post up

Homie in the hood like ""let me hold something""

Your mans in the hood talking all that shit

I came from the bottom of this bitch and made it out of that shit

And that's why we on top of this motherfucking world

Damn, look at that body

She come along with the territories

Turn around, move it for me, bend it over, end of story

Got a relationship with that money

(But that bitch will never be faithful to you)

Even though I know she knows she crazy

(Please just let it go, seize, no saving you)

Ride, ride

Til the motherfucking wheels fall off in this bitch

(We can do it for the love)

But I'm never stopping my poppin'

(These numbers don't lie, but your love is superficial

It's the simple shit you need to pay attention to)

I be stomping down demons, stomping down quick, come on



The police don't come around these parts

They tell me that we all a bunch of animals

The only time they wanna turn the cameras on

Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on



Bullets still ringing, blood on the cement

Black folks grieving, headlines reading

Tryna pay it no mind, you just living your life

Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions

I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight

Maybe cause I'm a bastard

Or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally

Still tryna figure out, why the fuck I'm full of rage

I think I know this is bullshit right around the fifth grade

Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switch blade

Nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid (Ay)

But I'm a product of the system raised on government aid

And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid (whoa)

Just a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us

And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us

So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis

Some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents

Not all of us criminals but cops be yelling, ""Stay back nigga!""

We need a little bit of payback

Don't treat me like an animal cause all this shit is flammable

Don't fuck around cause when it's done it's done

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem

I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off

Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf

Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant

But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet

No one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'till I took off

Mistook me because I look soft

But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders)

So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off

Decided opposing you is what I'm posed to do alls

I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls

And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all

You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls

And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone

My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls

And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls

Karma's headed for Armageddon,the drama setter

I'm going in, already got an arm and head

And whoever said word are just words

Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck

Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit

Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned

In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like

They didn't deserve what they get

And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it

So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?

And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime

As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind

I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine

Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find

I'm starting to slow and these lines full of nines

I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind

All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's)

Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time

Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh

Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun

Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none

I even make the bitches I rape cum

I'm waiting on someone to say something

Dre make the bass pump and let the tape run for old time's sake

I spit it straight through, this is take one

The moment you're waiting for has come but...

While I talk about the pages of my diary
Listen up
I remember when I got started my intention was to win
But a lot of shit changed since then

Some more friends became enemies in the quest of victory

But I made a vow, never let this shit get to me

I let it pass, so I consider that part of my history

And I'm strong; financially, physically

Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level

And don't forget that I came from the ghetto

Sold a new house for my moms, that's special

I let you going shopping till your feet get tired

Then a new Benz just for you to ride in

When I didn't have it, you provided

Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise

And my house got a view of the city like a highrise

I'm just talking to my diary, I'm just talking to my diary



When I open up my book I think about the world later

No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper

I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary



Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks

I remember how it used to be

Now my money like NASDAQ, my checks you can cash that

I remember how it used to be



I used to be a starving artist so I would never starve an artist

This is my passion, it's where my heart is

It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed

Like the nigga I started with

I know Eazy can see me now, looking down through the clouds

And regardless, I know my nigga still proud

It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks

We used to sit back, laugh and joke

Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters

You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing

Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella

Damn, I miss that

Shit, a nigga having flashbacks



When I open up my book I think about the world later

No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper

I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
Times is changin, young niggaz is agin
Becomin O.G.'s in the game and changin
to make way for these new names and faces but
the strangest things can happen from rappin

when, niggaz get wrapped up in image and actin

Niggaz get capped up and wrapped in plastic

and zipped up in bags when it happens, that's it

I've seen em come, I've watched em go

Watched em rise, witnessed it and watched them blow

Watched em all blossom and watched em grow

Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough

Best friends and money? I lost them both

Went and visisted niggaz in the hospital

and saw the same shit all across the globe

I just sit back and watch the show (the watcher)



Chorus: Dr. Dre



Cause everywhere that I go

ain't the same as befo' (the watcher)

People I used to know

just don't know me no mo' (the watcher)

But everywhere that I go

I got people I know (the watcher)

who got people they know

So I suggest you lay low (the watcher)



[Dr. Dre]

I moved out of the hood for good - you blame me?

Niggaz aim mainly at niggaz they can't be

But niggaz can't hit niggaz they can't see

I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach

How would you feel if niggaz wanted you killed?

You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill

and choose a new spot if niggaz wanted you shot

I ain't a thug - how much Tupac in you you got?

I ain't no bitch neither - it's either my life

or yo' life and I ain't leavin - I like breathin

Cause nigga we can go round for round

Clip for clip, shit fo'pound for pound

Nigga if you really wanna take it there we can

Just remember that you fuckin with a family man

I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that

when you wanna come and fill these shoes (the watcher)



Chorus



{*GUN SHOT*}



[Dr. Dre]

Things just ain't the same for gangstas

Cops is anxious to put niggaz in handcuffs

They wanna hang us, see us dead or enslave us

Keep us trapped in the same place we raised in

Then they wonder why we act so outrageous

Run around stressed out and pull out gauges

Cause everytime you let the animal out cages

It's dangerous, to people who look like strangers

But now we got a new era of gangsters

Hustlers and youngsters livin amongst us

Lookin at us, now callin us bustaz

Can't help but reminisce back when it was us

Nigga we started this gangsta shit!

And this the motherfuckin thanks I get?

It's funny how time fly

I'm just havin fun, just watchin it fly by (the watcher)

Hi baby
I know your under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand
You have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you

I love you so much

I think about you I feel you in my arms

I miss you.. I miss you terribly

I've just always wanted someone like you in my life

I love you so much; that I'd do anything

I'd do anything

I'll be your perfect woman for you



[Dr. Dre]

I just wanna fuck bad bitches

All them nights I never had bitches

Now I'm all up in that ass bitches

Mad at 'cha boyfriend, aint 'cha?

You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya

Gotta thank ya for that head clinic

Explicit, hella photogenic

And tell your friends where the dick's at

Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate

Before you kiss 'em use Colgate

""She Swallowed It!"" Yeah the bitch took the whole eight

and ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it

and Hit the Man hit it; damn bitches

Man, this is what I'm talkin about

Chicken-head, chicken-fed, with a dick in your mouth

Out and about with your nigga like it never took place

(Airtouched) Next time you need a taste



Chorus: 



I just wanna fuuuuuck you

No touchin and rubbin gul, you got a husband who

loves.. you..

Don't need you all in mine

I just wanna fuuuuuck you

We can't be kissin and huggin gul, you got a husband who

loves.. you..

You need to give him your quality time



[Devin the Dude]

You got the number, it's on you to make the call

You know I cum quick; help you re-decorate your walls

Cut your backyard, don't have to act hard to get the cock

And if I'm goin too far, I take it out and wipe it off

and put it back up, and keep going

You tryin to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin

that your pussy's been tampered with

Did you show him the new trick of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick

You be workin it like a dancer bitch, it's hard on me

Not to give you all of my time, that you wanted

You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed

I'd rather spend my mornin diggin through some records instead

But, tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases

Hookup somewhere and exchange some ""Fuck Faces""

I know your man's lookin for ya, he's always tryin to run ya

Don't worry bout me handcuffin gul cause I just wanna fuck witchu



[Snoop Dogg]

.. fuck witchu

On the sneak tip, on some creep shit

So whatcha gon' do, ya freak bitch?

You, actin, like you, don't, do, dicks

That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin wit

Baby was a virgin, that's what she said

So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head

I fucked her on the flo', so I wouldn't mess up my bed

Then Lil' 1/2 Dead put his dick on her head

Take that bitch home, and give her a bone

And give her the number to my cellular phone

Man, she blowin up my pager, the shit's gettin major

A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her

Somethin to go by, and bitches know why

Stuff dick in they mouth, and then I'm out (see-ya!)

Twenty-fo' seven, Dre, Snoop, and Devin

We servin' these hoes, and never lovin these hoes, beotch!

Disconnected from the streets forever

As long as I got a baretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva

I roll wit my shit off safety - for niggaz that been hatin me lately

If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath

Bumpin gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash

Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G.

started from that S.O.B., D.R.E.

[Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube - was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes

the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you

But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you

I still remember the window of the car that you went through

That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through

And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you

Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you

Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you

You see the truth is

Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is

And who I'm still cool wit

Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with

Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they *voice sample*

Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions

Move units, then talk shit and we can do this

Until then - I ain't even speakin your name

Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same

Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors

It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em

That's the difference



Chorus: Phish (repeat 2X)



What's the difference between me and you?

You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do

I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions

I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin



[Xzibit]

Yo I stay wit it

While you try to perpetrate, play wit it 

Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (YEAH)

I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted

I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick

(Yeah!) Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions

I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings

So what the fuck am I supposed to do?

I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)

A heartless bastard, high and plastered

My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never come down

Pass it around if you can't handle it

Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates

What's the difference between me and you? (What?)

About five back accounts, three ounces and two vehicles

Until my death, I'm Bangladesh

I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left

Yo that's the difference



Chorus



[Eminem]

Aight, hold up hold up!

STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say

Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me

(The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg

I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit



[Dre]Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it

But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch

[Em]I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?

[Dre]Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is



[Eminem]

Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer

But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma

I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her

And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California

And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner

at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her

Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off

Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of

Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up

Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up

and they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water

That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product

That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!

You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!

So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis

Or we can scream, ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it!

Or anyone tryin to bring trouble your way?

Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (YUP)

Then just study a tape of N.W.A.!

One day I was walkin by, wit a Walkman on, when I caught a guy

give me an awkward eye (What you lookin at?)

And strangled him off in the parkin lot, wit his Karl Kani

I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not

I'm harder than me tryin to park a Dodge

when I'm drunk as fuck

Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage {*CRUNCH*}

Hoppin out wit two broken legs, tryin to walk it off

""Fuck you too bitch, call the cops!""

I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin barkin dogs

And when the cops came through

me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house

Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches

And still weren't found out (RIGHT HERE)

From here on out it's the Chronic 2

Startin today and tomorrow's the new

And I'm still loco enough

To choke you to death wit a Charleston Chew

{*Eminem's vocal turntable*}

Slim shady - hotter then a set of twin babies 

in a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up

But you won't get a crumb from me

Cause I'm from the streets of (Compton, Compton)

I told em all - all them little gangstas 

Who you think helped mold 'em all?

Now you wanna run around talkin bout guns like I ain't got none

What you think I sold 'em all?

Cause I stay well off

Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off

What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad

tryin to get this damn label off?

I ain't havin that; this is the millenium of Aftermath

It ain't gon' be nothin after that

So give me one more platinum plaque

a bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend

So what you found you a hoe that you like

But you can't make a hoe a housewife (wife)

I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip

Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she bout to trip

(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty

You pimpin strong, but comin home, to sheets that be filthy

She on the dillzy, I take advantage

All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin Spanish

I'm mannish - get yo' nails out my back

Slut I'm bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat

Learn the player rules, this is how I play a dude

Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin shoes

Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it

Tryin to leave her, beeper just exploded

She sweatin me, won't let me, broad turned fraud

Now she on this dick huh, got her turnin tricks huh

Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin

I left her up in Dallas, Texas - assed-out

Naw hoe is short for honey, almost had her Wailin like Bunny

Tellin tales of bein pregnant, catchin Norstrom sales with abortion money

I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her

Now we got beef, he caught up in the hoe's erotica

Exotic - she's psychotic, rockin his Nautica

Soon he'll need antibiotics (sucka bitch)

Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody

You be like, ""Damn how could she hit me off with chlamydia?""

Fool I pity ya

We live in the city off, ballers

with more bouncin than a Zapp, she will doo-wah-diddy-ya

Prettier to grittier, the wittier can get her

to the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like, Rico

That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco

A high-post hoe, a perfect way for me to keep dough

Huh, have her sellin ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico



[Kurupt]

At the ho-tel, mo-tel, or the Holiday Inn (say what nigga?)

I said if that bitch keep fuckin up (beotch) then we'll fuck her friends

I said I dip, dive, what can I say?

Niggaz need to stop fuckin with O.J.

Some niggaz bang blood, some niggaz bang crip

And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

I had to dream of hoes, I had to scream at hoes

I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes

Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy

if you blew my balls, right through my drawers

Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot

From the way she was blowin, I know she does it a lot

I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters

The hoe started callin when I started boss ballin

Gimme some head, gimme some ass (uh-huh)

Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz

Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate

Hoes eat dick like eggs and steak

That ain't shit new, I thought you knew (what?)

It was just one of those days

when I wanted to catch sunrays

Fun to get blunted on a Sunday, afternoon

Nigga ? got room, grab the gat for misbehavors

and the chocolate faded boom, flossin hip-hop tunes

Zoom-zoom like the Commodores

Wonder will we have drama or, end up clownin whores

Around the full good-to-go girls

like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby

I be postin all-world in The Ra

Sippin 151 that gave me too much pride to back down

Soon as we get to The Beach I'ma put my fuckin mack down

I'm playin lead, not the background

It's time to put Bronson on the map now

Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile

Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite

I'ma have to ack-wild



Chorus: sung by Hittman



Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right

Strap by my waistline, cause niggaz don't fight

Sucker free for life, so you better think twice

(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)

I'm the type of nigga playa haters don't like

Snatchin up your honey for some late night hype

And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite

(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)



[Hittman]

Uhhhhh.. drink kickin in, I'm stimulated

For those that don't know big words, I'M FUCKIN FADED

Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot

Our first spot was cool til some gangsters made it hot

Now we plot and pose

plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed

gettin swarmed by those type of niggaz

with no game but brown-nose

So I impose only like pros can

""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No.""

Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman.""

Bling! Gold chain gleam

""You're very eligible for my summer league team.""

Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed

Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethern

I got mad spit flame on the name

Stefan, tattooed on her arm

Hoe you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke

witcho' lips swoll, and give a nig' some ackrite



Chorus (minus the word ""Aight"" both times)



[Hittman]

Frontin on the ack-rite, causin me to act up

Good Samaritan save that hoe from gettin slapped up

My homies crack up at the scene I made

Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade

If it wasn't for the one-time brigade

I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp

As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp

Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes

from fake macks {*CAR HORN*} aiyyo, chase them girls

in that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her

neckbone, lookin back at us

Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush

They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush

Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch

Keep it on hush without the tip-in

Mackin interrupted by some niggaz set-trippin

Clip in the strap, I showed these niggaz how to act

Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates

Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop

On every corner, Cali niggaz are dumpin

You'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's

Makin death not so foreign to ya

A message to God

[Dr. Dre]

Since you finishin em early, what posessed you to start him?

We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part

Lord, I thought we was made for each other

You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other

Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was

I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you

You knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect

you coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him

He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word

The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?

I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded - wonderin why

Cryin, pourin out my heart, pourin out liquor behind it

We fought like brothers, somethin we never should do

We coulda used time spent arguin tellin the truth

He had talent too - I had plans on watchin him grow

Don't know what hurts more - seein him leave, or watchin him go



[Mary J. Blige]

Listen listen listen.. (listen) whoahh (listen)

[Rell] + {Mary}

If you wanna know why.. {why I live my life}

The way that I do.. {cause I got to get this money}

So don't worry about me.. {cause I know my way around}

I'm just hustlin everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper



[Dr. Dre]

Youse a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there

Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there

If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew

I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you

We lost a thug, a son, and a father

I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him

The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file

cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial

Prayin you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt

You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it

I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face

to straight breakin down and showin all emotions

I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry

If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta

It's just not me, but you know I'ma always ride wit you

I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit you

Mista Busta, where the fuck ya at?
Can't scrap a lick, so I know ya got your gat
Your dick on hard, from fuckin your road dogs

The hood you threw up with, niggaz you grew up with

Don't even respect your ass

That's why it's time for the doctor, to check your ass, nigga

Used to be my homey, used to be my ace

Now I wanna slap the taste out yo mouth

Make you bow down to the row

Fuckin me, now I'm fuckin you, little ho

Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide

Let me ride, just another homicide

Yeah it's me so I'ma talk on

Stompin on the 'Eazy'est streets that you can walk on

So strap on your Compton hat, your locs

And watch your back cause you might get smoked, loc

And pass the bud, and stay low-key

B.G. cause you lost all your homey's love

Now call it what you want to

You fucked wit me, now it's a must that I fuck wit you

Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talkin about

Put down the candy and let the little boy go

The sounds of a dog brings me to another day

Play, with my bone would ya Timmy

But here's a jimmy joke about your mama that you might not like

I heard she was the 'Frisco dyke

But fuck your mama, I'm talkin about you and me

Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T

Your bark was loud, but your bite wasn't vicious

And them rhymes you were kickin were quite bootylicious

You get with Doggy Dogg oh is he crazy?

With ya mama and your daddy hollin' Bay-Bee

So won't they let you know

That if you fuck with Dre nigga you're fuckin wit Death Row

And I ain't even slangin them thangs

Step on up. Now, we ain't no motherfuckin joke so remember the name

Now understand this my nigga Dre can't be touched

Musta, thought I was sleazy

Or though I was a mark cause I used to hang with Eazy

Animosity, made ya speak but ya spoke

Ay yo Dre, whattup, check this nigga off loc

If it ain't another ho that I gots ta fuck with

Gap teeth in ya mouth so my dick's gots to fit

With my nuts on ya tonsils

While ya onstage rappin at your wack-ass concerts

And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside

To show you how Death Row pull off that whoride

Now you might not understand me

Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami

Then we gon creep to South Central

On a Street Knowledge mission, as I steps in the temple

Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap

Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat

You tryin to check my homey, you better check yo self

Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, MOTHERFUCKER

just another motherfuckin day for Dre so I begin like this

No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists it's just

word to the motherfuckin streets

and word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats, that I

hit ya with that I, get ya with

as I groove in my four on deez, hittin the switches

bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on

bumpin like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on

but before I hit the dope spot

I gotta get the chronic, the Reme Martin and my soda pop

Now I'm smellin like indo-nesia

bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers

on my dick, cause my four on hit

pancake front and back, side to side and all that shit

So when I crawl I comes correct

Check this out

The sun went down when I hit Slausson

on my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin

Checkin my rearview, cause niggaz they will do

jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools

Try to set me up for a two-eleven

Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven

but I don't represent no gangbang

Some niggaz like lynchin but I just watch them hang

so on, and so-on, why don't you let me roll on

I remember back in the dayz when I used to have to get my stroll on

Didn't nobody wanna speak; now everybody

peepin out they windows when they hear me beatin up the streets

Is it Dre? Is it Dre?

That's what they say, every single motherfuckin day, yo

But livin in the city it's do-or-die



[Daz]

Dem wonder why me violent and no really understand

For de reason why me take me law, in me own, hand

Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King

De gun goes - click, me gun goes - bang

Dem riot in Compton and dem riot in Long Beach

Dem riot in L.A. cause dem no really wanna see

niggaz start to loot and police start to shoot

Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricades us like Beirut

Me don't show no love cause it's us against dem

Dem never ever love me cause it's sport to break dem

and kill, at my own risk, if I may

to lay, to spray, with my AK, and put it to rest

There have been riots, ahh uh, rioting

Well I don't wanna say rioting 

but there's been looting downtown

But right now Bree, what I want to show you is

they have started fires down at the end of the street)



[All]How many niggaz are ready to loot?

Sittin in my living room, calm and collected 

Feelin that gotta-get-mine perspective

cause what I just heard, broke me in half

and half the niggaz I know, plus the niggaz on the Row is bailin

Laugh now but cry much later

Ya see when niggaz get together 

they get mad cause they can't fade us

Like my niggaz from South Central, Los Angeles

They found that they couldn't handle us

Bloods, Crips on the same squad

with the Ese's help and nigga it's time to rob and mob

(And break the white man off somthin lovely, biddy-bye-bye

I don't love dem so dem can't love me)

Yo, straight puttin it down gettin my scoot on

It's jump in off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on

and come up on me some furniture or somethin

Got a VCR, in the back of my car

that I ganked from the Slausson Swap Meet

And motherfuckers better not try to stop me

Cause they will see that I can't be stopped

cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop

One-Time trigger happy, no nigga love

One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove

Can't get prints on a nine I throw away

or get prints on my Uzi when it spray

POP POP, POP, another motherfucker drop

And I get relief like, ""plop plop fizz""

Smash, I crashed his head like a window

I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo

Creepin, with the quickness, to the cut

Bust, one to his head, while he munches on a donut

and crack-up, so now he best to back up

I guess I gots to pack up, filling, the clip up

I zip up-town, but motherfuckin cops are all around

Helicopters flyin, these motherfuckers tryin

to catch me and stretch me on Death Row

But hell no, suppose black refuse to go??

So, all of you Africans
All of you Africans that wanna do thangs
that's workin for other people
Y'all need to open your own business
Save your money, quit payin motherfuckers with jheri curls

Quit payin motherfuckers with perms

Save your money, start your own business

and you true Africans, will have put hundreds to work

This is our future right here, this out future right here

{*applause*}

(This some shit! The new generation is on! The new generation!)

Hey, I'ma tell you right now..

If if if I have to die today, for this little African right here

to have a future I'm a dead motherfucker

(You right!)



[Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg]

Wake up, jumped out my bed

I'm in a two-man cell, with my homie Lil 1/2 Dead

Murder was the case that they gave me

Dear God, I wonder can you save me

I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck

It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck

But that's the life of a G, I guess

Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest

Best, run, cause brothers is droppin quicker

Ughh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga

Bouncin off the walls, throwin them dogs

Gettin that rep, as a young hog

It ain't nuttin like the street life

You betta be strapped wit yo' shank

cause ain't no fist fight

So I guess I gots ta handle mine

Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time



[Daz]

Them say me grow up to be nuttin, look at me now what do you see

I am what I am it's only me



[Chorus]

Lil' ghetto boy.. playin in the ghetto streets

Whatcha gonna do when you grow up.. and have to face responsibility?



[Verse Two: Dr. Dre]

Now I'm holdin the dove, sittin on swoll

Twenty-seven years old, up for parole, stroll

I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money

that I'll be makin soon as I touch the street

Thangs done changed on this side

Remember they used to thump - but now they blast, right

But it ain't no thang to me

Cause now I'm what they call a loc'd-ass O.G.

The little homies from the hood wit grip

are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip 

Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so whatchu wanna do?

Didn't know we had a twenty-two

Straight sittin behind his back

I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps

I fell to the ground..

with blood on my hands, I didn't understand

How a nigga so young could bust a cap

I used to be the same way back

I guess that's what I get (For what?)

For tryin to jack them little homies for they grip



[Daz]

Me learn many things of what me see from the streets

The outcome of what I come to be



[Chorus]



[Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg]

Somethin for the real O.G.'s to get wit

Some facts, made our made, now you runnin but I'm played

like every single day, really doe

You know me, I'm the smooth macadamian, gamin them for my homie

No need to be uncalm if you pack right

And learnin just enough to keep your sack right

Late nights, I wonder what they gettin fo'

Early mornin on the corners, what they hittin fo'

Seven young G's put they serve down

In a G-ride, Eastside's where they swerve now

Not thinking about what's really goin on

Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone

I spent four years in the county

wit nuttin but convicts around me

But now I'm back at the Pound

And we expose ways, for the youth to survive

Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's riiight

So make all them ends you can make

cause when you're broke, you break, check it out

So ain't no need for your mama to trip

Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clockin your grip



[Daz]

And now me life as you can see, still an O.G.

for life and always remain to be, a little ghetto boy..

A nigga witta motherfuckin gun
44 reason come to mind
Why you motherfuckin brothers' hard to find
He be walkin on the streets and fuckin with mine

Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind

See I never take a step on a Compton block

or LA without the AK ready to pop

Cos them punk motherfuckers in black and white

Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight

I thinks it's better to be retellin the facts than cuffed up

and jacked and fucked up

What you niggas lookin at? You goin

goddamn! Cos it's the city

and for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta

And I'm a nigga you can't remove

Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin to prove

To their homies that they can hang by dealin with me

But once again in the end they D-E-A-D

I never did time on a murder yet

Cos I relax and back, do a job and jet

Yo I know you understand my flow

So here we go with Death Row

Come let a motherfucker know



Who is the man with the masterplan?

A nigga witta motherfuckin gun

Who is the man with the masterplan?

A nigga witta motherfuckin gun



D-R-E

A motherfucker who's known for carryin gats

and kick raps that make snaps

Adapts to anything violent that I'm located at

If you see me on the solo moves best believe that I'm strapped

4-4, .tre-8 or AK-47

Cos slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven

Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back

and lay a punk motherfucker flat

As he wonder what popped before he got popped

I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop

Now I know you understand my flow

So here we go with Death Row

I breaks em off, I breaks em off yeah

I breaks em off, I breaks em off yeah

I breaks em off but I ain't speakin about between the thighs

I'm talkin about cockin a gauge in between your eyes

That'll make you drop to your knees cos you realise

that a gat will make any nigga civilised

Old buster ass nigga talkin bullshit

Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with

Get lit or hit up by the doctor

A nigga that breaks em off proper-ly

Real G so doubt it

I'm the one who's doin it while these other niggas talk about it

And if motherfuckers come at me wrong

I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin dome

And show him why they call me the notorious one

The name's Dre Eastwood when I'm packin a gun

You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try

And if you die youse a buster cos real niggas don't die

But some still don't hear me though

You're too near me not to hear me, nigga yo

So now you know

Now I'ma kick up -- dust, as I begin to bust
on the wick-wack, fucked up suckers ya can't trust

When I kick up, I lick up, ya face get smacked up

when I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up

or get slapped with the swiftness

If you think you're swift with the gift Merry Christmas

Now stuff that in your stockin

I'm knockin em out the box 'n'

knockin em out their socks 'n', cause Robin is rockin

Breakin em down to the -- slab

Takin em down on their -- ass

Now what you wanna do, ya wanna battle, uhh?

Send you up shit creek without a motherfuckin paddle

Rattle -- that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane

Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothin more than a grain

or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel

Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to 'That Other Level'

You think you got pull then pull it, uhh!

I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet

then bite the dust and wipe the fuss

Do what I must, and what I must - is bust

the bubble, or choose some trouble, for you

So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin through



{*cut n scratch* ""Some cool shit"" 2X*}

[Kurupt]

I fears no one, I makes em cool off like a polar cat

Lynchin, as a hit, misses the roll of dice

Pushin packs to make a profit

Diggy dope duck on the topic so stop and gimme my props, kid

I'm livin large like a fat bitch

So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart, for the faggots

This young black kid, a mercenary, merciless

Murderin millions of niggaz so who's first to diss

They say I'm bad so you'll find none worse than this

Chewin motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss

Put to sleep, lovin the lyrics I leave in the minds of each

Roogh when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece

So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggaz

You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass nigga

Then watch me blast, nigga, cause I'm the last nigga

you wanna fuck wit, so up your cash, nigga

I make em stagger, I'm skanless as Jimmy Swaggart

I'm a good tracker, scopin your girl then watch me tag her

Pullin steel like a stunt

Sewn like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so

here to torment I put track on crack

And I'm strapped wit a semi-tone milli-ten Mac

Yo, I breaks em off, I breaks em off, chief

Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th

Back in the days, niggaz they use to scrap

but now in ninety-two, niggaz they pull they strap

cause umm, police dem come wicked and dem shoot

niggaz, so niggaz retaliate and start to loot

Execute, boot, stompin

Black soldier, here to teach and mould ya

The innovator, dominator, narra-rator

R-B to the motherfuckin X -- flex wicked

Stylee me, bump and be found and do bleed by a

maniac, with a gat

See nowadays niggaz is like that

I pull my trigger back, the bullets go

BO! BO! BO! Now I'm on Death Row

Fuck it, niggaz goin wild

Everynight they shoot, it's like Bei-rut

Maybe you should get a teflon vest for your chest

anytime steppin through my hood

But that'll do you no good

One slug to your face, no haste

you're gettin smoked like wood

Nasty nigga bloody pumps face flat

on the concrete, here comes the white sheet

Mr. Coroner, cocked with some yellow tape

but, the murderers escape

Audi like 5 G's

Yes.. it is I says me..
And all who agree.. are more than three, cause they we.. (*laughter*)
Yes.. yo! I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
who knows what evil lurks within them

But let's take a travel down the blindside

And see what we find on this... path... called...



[Verse One: Kurupt]

Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit

I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits

The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal

Niggaz know, the flow that I kick, there's no refill

I'm murderin niggaz, yo, and maybe because of the tone

I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit niggaz can't fuck with

So remember I go hardcore, and slam

Nuff respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme

So any nigga that claim they bossin

What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slausson

Take a walk through the hood, and we up to no good

Slangin on things like a real O.G. should

I'm stackin and mackin and packin a ten so

When you're slippin, I slip the clip in, but ain't no set-tripppin

Cause it's Death Row, rollin like the mafia

Think about whoopin some ass, but what the fuck stoppin ya?

Ain't nathin but a buster

I'm ""Stranded on Death Row"" for pumpin slugs in motherfuckers

Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun

Kurupt inmate cell block one



[Verse Two: RBX]

No prevention from this lynchin of sorts

Your're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts

No extensions, all attempts are to fail

Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile

From the lunatic, I'm death like arsenic

When I kick a wicked raps, Dr. Dre will hit the scratch

With treachery, my literary form will blast

And totally surpass the norm

Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms

When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms

In this dimension, I'm the presenter

And the inventor, and the tormentor

Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler

MC mangler, tough like Wrangler

I write a rhyme, hard as concrete

Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite!

So what you wanna do?

The narrator RBX, cell block two



[Verse Three: The Lady of Rage]

Rage, lyrical murderer; ""Stranded on Death Row""

And now I'm servin a - lifetime sentence

There'll be no repentence

Since it's the life that I choose to lead I plead guilty

On all counts let the ball bounce where it may

It's just another clip into my AK

Buck 'em down with my underground tactics

Facts and stacks of clips on my matress -

bed frame there's another dead, bang

Layin lame put to shame, who's to blame?

Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman comin

from the D-E-A-T-Hin, R-O-W takin, no shit

So flip and you're bound to get dropped

It's 187 on motherfuckers don't stop

Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate

It's Rage, from cell block eight



[Verse Four: Snoop Doggy Dogg]

Aiyyo steppin through the fog and creepin through the smog

It's the number one nigga from the hood Doggy Dogg

Makin videos, now I stay in Hollywood

Bustin raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood

Dre is the Dr. and my homey little nigga

Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga

Shootin at the hoes with the game that I got

Sent to Death Row cause I wanted to make a grip from servin my rocks

And I'm still, servin for mines, peace

to my motherfuckin homies doin time

In the pen and the county jail

Mobbin with your blues on, mad as hell

And you say yeah fuck the police

And all the homies on the streets is all about peace

And it's drivin the cops crazy

But ain't nuttin but a black thing bay-bee, uhhh

{*Snoop starts singing*}

Uhh I'm not flaggin, but I'm just saggin

I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G

And you can't see, the D-R to the E

Or my motherfuckin homey D.O.C.

You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin DJ

That's my homey and we call him Warren G

{*Snoop stops singing*}

Yeah, and you don't stop

Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the motherfuckin Dogg Pound

That's the only way we'll beat 'em man

We gotta smoke 'em, then choke 'em like the motherfuckin peter man

It's like three and to the two and two and to the one

Cell block four peace Doggy Dogg's done



[Outro: Bushwick Bill]

Yo, now you know the path I'm on

You think you're strong, see if you can travel on

Cause only the weak, will try to speak

Those who are quiet, will always cause riots

There's three types of people in the world

Those who don't know what happened

Those who wonder what happened

And people like us from the streets that MAKE things happen!"

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on deez nutz and suck the dick

Get's the fuck out after you're done

And I hops in my ride to make a quick run...



Dr. Dre

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright

We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night

Tight than a mutharfucka with the gangsta beats

And we was ballin' on the muthafuckin' Compton streets

Peep, the shit got deep and it was on

Number 1 song after number 1 song

Long as my muthafuckin' pockets was fat

I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at

But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do

Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2

And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'

Now she's suing cuz the shit she be doin' ain't shit

Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short 

So now she's takin' me to court

It's real conversation for your ass

So recognize and pass to Daz



Daz:

Now as i'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood

Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good

We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks

(Snoop: But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that

This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow

Ya run up in them hoes and grab the cash

And get your dash on 

While you're chillin', with your homies and shit 

And how my niggaz kick the anthem like this

(Snoop: BEEEYYAAACHHH!)



(chorus)



Kurupt:

...To the store, to get me a 4-0

Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes

So I head down the street to long beach

Just so i could meet, a freak 

To lick me from my head to my feet

And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up

Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up

Bitches on my nuts like clothes

But i'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes

How could you trust a hoe? (Snoop: Why?(echoed 3X)

Cuz a hoe's a trick

We don't love them tricks (Snoop: Why?(echoed 3X)

Cuz a trick's a bitch

And my dick's constantly in her mouth

And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out

Now...



Snoop:

I once had a bitch named Mandy May

Used to be up in them guts like everyday

The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung

I was in love like a muthafucka lickin' the protung

The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good

But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood

So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine

Guess what? Got gaffled by one time

I'm back to the muthafuckin' county jail

6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail

I get's released on a hot sunny day

My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre

Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news

Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues

I ain't been out a second

And already gotta do some muthafuckin chin checkin

Move up the block as we groove down the block

See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock

Kick in the do', I look on the flo'

It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo 

(Bitches ain't shit)

I uncocked my shit...I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed

Man, fuck a bitch!



(Chorus)



Jewell:

(Dr. Dre in background ""Bitches ain't shit"")

I don't give a fuck about a bitch

But i and her know that they can't fade this 

Cause i'm doin my own thingdown with the swang

I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing

I say you know can't deal

Cuz I'm a btich that's real

Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah

They need to chill

Because I don't give a fuck

And I don't give a fuck (x3)



And now I gotta do some...

And now I gotta do some shit that's clean

But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean

Like a washing machine

I can wash the clothes

All the hoes knows

That i'm on the flo' ho

But they can't hang with my type on swang

I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang

But just the juicy ones

Witht he tip of the tongue

And then their sprung

With the nuts hung 

(Dr. Dre: Bitches ain't shit)"
