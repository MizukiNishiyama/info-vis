I hit the weed I told myself the last time would be my last
I don't trust my own niggas now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me I ain't stopping for their ass
Boy you know my L's dirty if they stop me I'm goin' to jail surely

I'll be next to my brother in the cell no bail for me

Man let me out send me back to bitches that smell Purdy (pretty)

And all I gotta do is call once and she'll be all ready

Yeah buddy cant you tell I'm goin' through hell

I don't even open my mail

I'm in the shower with soap on the towel

I need cleansing

Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes

Pussy niggas running they mouth but we ain't flinching

They names ain't even mentioned

I got dreams bigger than your whole team

You niggas so broke but yet you seem so green

I guess its envy, started with a penny now I'm getting plenty money



[Hook]

One time for the city, yea

Two times for you

Hey

And one time for the city, hey

And two times for you

Hey



[Verse 2]

Look here it's raining outside boy fuck a umbrella 

Niggas banging outside, boy they guns dumb bell a nigga

Tired of tellin' niggas that's the cease rest in peace

We tired of only havin' just a piece and fuck police 

And they killin' niggas what's the reason?

His daughter's starvin' and she fuckin' freezes

So no wonder why he fuckin' squeezin'

They out here bustin', leavin' niggas stuck and bleedin' on the flo'

Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho

Breathin' slow man, I inhale

One day you tryna make the rent

The next day you in jail

Lord knows he meant well

So I take the pencil and right like a pen pal

So shit that's darker than the tints up on the windshield

Welcome to Sin-ville, where niggas on base shit

It's lookin' like an infield, high as a Sprint bill

What you think? That's reason why this ink in my pen kills



Phony niggas 'til they are extinct bitch I been real



[Hook]

One time for the city, yea

Two times for you

Hey

And one time for the city, hey

And two times for you

Hey



[Verse 3]

The more niggas sayin'

Cole the wrong one bringin' the city shine

All he ever doin' is paintin' pictures of crime

Tellin' stories of pain, paintin' pictures of dope

Bitch if you listen I'm paintin' pictures of hope

That boy in class embarrassed because he broke

Hopin' the day he won't be the butt of somebody's jokes

See me; I lived it all from dirt-poorin' and trailer 

Worried about my mother and never trustin' my neighbors

To middle-class with a backyard and my own room

To bein' the only black kid in my homeroom

Academically gifted and followed my own rules

Was runnin' the streets hey ma I'll be home soon

Was out chasin' ho's, was out hoopin'

Them niggas wasn't ballin' but yet they was foul shootin'

So meet the newest role model who don't know how to fake this shit

Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch



[Hook]

One time for the city, yea

Two times for you

Hey

And one time for the city, hey

And two times for you

Hey



[Outro]

Girl it's been so long, I've been gone from you

But you ain't gotta worry 'bout the thangs I do

It's hard but the thought of you would ease my pain

Girl I promise they gon' know our name

Ain't seen you smile in a while

But I been dreamin' 'bout you"

Hey,
Yeah,
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs Huckstable

These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like lunchables

Like white boys in grade school

We ate school made food just

Eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit

Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn't buying that shit

No I ain't crying a bit man

That's just life that's just how shit work

You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt

Gotta learn when you get hurt

Even if it's with cupid

He beat you and you went back

Who's officially stupid

Oh yeah I understand that's your man,

You had a plan

You been together for some years

You sticking with him for the kids

So you overlook the tears but we both know that's a bad look

Cause 20 years from now your daughter will probably get her ass whooped

If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use

But just in case it's perfect let me introduce

Cole, cole, cole



If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use

But just in case it's perfect let me introduce

It's Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move

A I'll ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school

Still rap for hustlers and ma'fuckers that hated school

Said that's for busters that heard my shit and I made it cool

This ain't to say that I'm gifted as if I'm Christmas shopping

I got gangsta niggas that lining up in that missions office

And possibly cause all the hoe niggas scrape

And I shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class

I'd much rather sit up in first class

Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash

Was it experience so nah I didn't wear it out

Always thought my first time would be with someone I cared about

But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed bout

I used to ask for practice so I wasn't scared out my mind

You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind

Was just a young boy staring out my blind

Till I got free from my momma leash

Running loose through the streets

Like a stray dog in heat

And we looking for some freaks can you play

Pardon me, what's your name, don't mistake me for no lame

No not me

She do hours on the team cause she seen how tall I'd be

In the club dappin' niggas, [?] R-I-P

Damn, you win some, you lose some

That just how it's happens

And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em

Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom

It's funny I barely told nobody I started rapping

Cause see some niggas was haters that I viewed as clowns

At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around

I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now

If they don't know your dreams, than they can't shoot em down"

I'll be next to my brother in the cell

Let me out

Send me back to bitches that smell

Party up all I got to do

Is call them up and they are ready

Yeah I'm... can you tell?



I put up through hell

I don't even open my mail

I'm gonna shave with a soap and a tail

I need... bad bitches all in the crowd



Pussy niggers running their mouth

And we ain't flitching

Your name's in the...

I got drains bigger than your hole...

You make it so broke

Hey, one time
Hey, one time
One time

Throw your hands to the sky tonight

Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the World right now

But I gotta make sure I'm right

And girl you damn right, if your head right

I'll be there every night

I just might change your life

Cause baby...



You got it (you got it)

You got it (you got it)

You got it (you got it)

You got it (you got it)



[Verse 1: J. Cole]

Hey Cole World, real cold World

I watch it hit the floor and watch it drop it real low girl

Last time I seen ya, you was a lil old girl

I had a crush now we grown and we still so thorough

Clap for her, work it till you exhausted

I swear nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it

Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass

God damn your ex man is a dumb ass

When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?

Was he stressin' you, wasn't fucking you right

Well one man's trash is another man's treasure

One man's pain is another man's pleasure

One damn thing you can't change is the weather

But even if it rain, we get rained on together

It's whatever, you shine, I shine,

I know you got a 9-5 I'll be your 5-9!



[Chorus: J. Cole]



[Verse 2: J. Cole]

Yeah, go ahead and pop it like you do in the mirror

I'm picking through the cloud tryna see a little clearer

High heel wearer, hell of a body

First one to spot ya and I ain't telling nobody

Nope, I'm peaking at your ass, winking at your ass

If I don't beg I'll be thinking bout your ass

For the whole week no time for cold feet

She too bad to pass, so fine I don't speak

I tell her my name Jermaine, I'm tryna be lowkey

She tell me I go tthat flame, your rhymes are so deep

Man, girl thank you, shit you so bad know your daddy wish he could still spank you

Hold up for these other niggas roll up and try and get ya

The ones that say they riders but never do ride with ya

I'm tryna vibe with ya so won't you throw me your phone number

And let them lames get ya old number



[Chorus: J. Cole]



[Wale:]

Roc Nation, Wale



Look, Cole World, still a cold world

And a couple ya is cool but we a little more thorough

Whole town, a little more girls

You know I spit that sick shit and there's still no cure

Hold up, low packs like I got cancer

Choking on them white boys make a black panther

Love my women with high heels and high standards

And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers

I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat

I ain't superstitious I make all these broads flip my pole

You dig it, this shit ain't for beginners

I'm something like a fetus, I'm not quite kidd'n

And there's something you ain't seeing like I block your vision

Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop

Hundred k in 22 hours

See money talks, you ma'fuckers is Boomhower

No check back, in debt yep

Loud in my J, I smoking [?]

Higher than I need to be

Flyer cause I need to be

Love our conversation but it's late right now, I need a beat

One time for the Ville that Cole rep

Another time for the city of slow death

I don't understand why these niggas so vexed

I don't need no chains with no cross to know that I'm blessed

Hey,
To the college kids no scholarships, starting your semester
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser
Enjoy it while you got it, after that it's God bless ya

Life is your professor, you know that bitch is gon test ya

I got some shit I'd like to get off my chest

I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress

And can I spit out my stress?

It's the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic

He said Cole, ""a lil birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic""

Nobody touching Nas nigga it's more like Villematic

Uh, these fayettnam tales be paying off well

What story is my audio theatre gon tell

I know my debut will ship, but is it gon sell?

I guess it's in God's hand's

I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say God damn

That's for your non-believers, I'm the truth only time will teach ya

And fuck the haters probably never love they momma's neither

Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class

Homes with computers on hating on the newest song

While you was browsing I was taking out them student loans

Tryna to do this shit better than the niggas we grew up on

Name a fucking song I ain't threw up on

Talk is cheap, it's like ya'll grew up in a Jewish home!

Pardon the stereotype

But ya'll giving me mixed feeling's like you married a white woman

One minute I'm over-rated, next minute I'm the saviour

You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya

For bullshitttin' and the nigga Cole spittin' that real

Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville

To Miami, where the same time last year

I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear

Cause now I'm dealing with money I've never seen before

And RnB bitches want me, that was just dreams before

Now do I give in to the temptation I'm facin'

The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasin'

But I'm just a man, at time's the timing is wrong

Plus my dick is like a man with a mind of it's own

But I'm trying to be strong, remind myself she ain't about shit

These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit

Looking for chesse on some mouse shit

Suck a nigga, fuck a nigga, than go run they mouth quick

Rappers took a vacation I came over the house sit

You want change, this that ""between the seats in your couch"" shit

The fuck you thought, I lost it

All that flame on my name would get exhausted

Au contraire my nigga they all ears

Sit back, enjoy the ride it's finna be a long year, yeah

It's finna be a long year, yeah



I know you feel that,

The tingle in your spine don't conceal that

Don't conceal that

This exactly what you thought

Somebody bought the real back

Yea, this is where the
Yea, this is where the fathers ain't living
At least not with us

Might see em round the city and won't even say wassup

When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors

And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error

Just a small time nigga, big city hustle

Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell

These were our heroes, strictly for them zero's

For that Robert Deniro, niggas reload on them kilo's

Dodgin them people,

Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I'd rather not tell

Shawty smole crack and her boyfriend too

Sometimes he touch her daughter like them boyfriends do

Pull up to the club where the boys went too

See that yellow tape and the boys in blue

A nigga on a strecther and though I never met ya

I'm thinking God Bless ya, they city try and get ya

Man, don't let the city get ya

Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes lke a wrestler

If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue

Your face on the front of our shirts saying we miss ya

(We miss ya)

Come with me,

Run quick see, what do we have here

Now, do you wanna ride or die

Run quick see, what do we have here

Now, do you wanna ride or die

[Verse 2: Omen]

Yea, let's see God

I know you only do what's best for me

But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny

They always tellin' me it's temporary

Than why it's feelling like a cemetary

My dreams ain't got no obituaries

My city hurting and none of us were equiped here

You heard me say I was ballin'

I probably make tears

I'm trying to get clear

I'm tryna quit fear

Who wrote the scripts here

These kids live there whole life just killing time

Running the race with no finish line

They tryna noose us with they ropes

But I'm tryna climb

I think my foolish pride might become my suicide

But I ain't tryna go, no baby

And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope

Cause I ain't dying

My words gon' last forever,

You can hold the treasure

Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind

I'm tired of seeing dope fiends, wiping they nose clean

Is my neighbourhood just a smoke screen

I think I'm in the Dungeon Fam, I see lo green

Sons raised by bo queens but there's no kings

(No kings, no kings)



[Hook: J. Cole]

Come with me,

Run quick see, what do we have here

Now, do you wanna ride or die

La dadada, la la la la



Come with me,

Run quick see, what do we have here

Now, do you wanna ride or die

[Verse 3: J. Cole]

It seems like niggas either feel ya or they try and kill ya

I face the sky and hope to God ain't acting unfamiliar

You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar

They tell me that it's God's will, I'm asking God will ya

Heal a nigga from all this pain, momma smoking cocaine as it rains out

Am I to blame, try to stay sane so I came out-side

Where they rock with them thangs out

To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boys brains out

But will it change, it's like niggas is free but our minds still in the chains

Brothers killing eachother, the blood spill it's a shame

Will it ever slow up

Alot of niggas getting older but they never grow up

And do they son's like they fathers did and never show up

Don't even cry about it, just another episode of life

Watch the season nigga no re-runs

The devil buying soul's nigga no refunds

Man, don't let the city get ya

Fuck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler

If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue

Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya

Another day, another song, a mother prays

Another gone

But still we play like ain't nothing wrong

Like ain't nothing wrong

Cause ain't nothing wrong

I'm not as fast, I'm not as tall

But before I pass

I gotta ball

I gotta ball

I gotta ball

Nigga I gotta ball"

Was broke as dishes tryna let it go

Hit the club she drop it low, lower than my credit score

Account overdraft what I got this debit for

Summers dead it got me drinking thinking bitch I better blow

I better blow,

How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles

You mean to tell me everything gon be fine

If I call your hotline and pay 29.99 shit

Well damn, why ain't you say so

Take this shaking ass multiply all my pesos

And erase my number out the phone of these fake hoes

I saved her number just in case but now it's case closed

To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter

You'll never be me partner so it don't fucking matter

You try to be and your career will see funerals

And be you that's what it sounds, beautiful

And maybe you could blow up

Done be ashamed-it ain't no thang, I used to blow tress, getting lifted

I quit the shit, I might get high with you

It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you

I flower you, a powerful, you do something to me

Cause girl I caught the vibez like you threw something to me-so I threw em' back

Now all my niggaz hollering ""who is that?

Oh boy she bad nigga, what chu bout to do with that? ""

Baby you so fine



Ay can I hit it I the morning?

The sun rising while you moaning



Yea, yea

You like the slow songs?

You like some candles lit?

That ain't really my style But see I planned a trip

And yea we both cumin, just tell me how you want it

I give it to you like I owe you something, when I'm on it,

On it like my job, I'm hoping I confess

This life gets hard I can take away your stress if you let me

You knew just what this was when you met me

So let your guard down girl

I'll take your bra down girl and undress ya

Real slow yea I'll make you feel special

I can feel your heart beating fast

From the passion, ya hands reaching for the sheets to grab

And now ya leaking, while we freaking ain't no speakin but ya moaning!

Ya so fine I got to give it to you



And can I hit it I the morning?

Can I hit it in the morning?

The sun rising while you moaning

So can I hit it in the morning?

Ay can I hit it in the morning?

The sun rising while you moaning



Yeah, yeah, uh

I got a slight obsession-of watch your face while ya moaning

Do you like caressin or do you like aggression?

You the fighting, wrestling, biting pillows

Do you want it in the dark or while the lights is still on?

I'm fantasizing in my mind bout how your body feel

While we sweating, you drippin wet from what your body spill

Now if your nervous and hesitant just let it go

See baby lately seems my life been hell

And heaven knows that you looking like an angel

Sent from the heavens, God bless your every angle

Got a nigga tangle in your spider web

I'm doing shit I never might of did

And I ain't stopping baby even if the light is red

Your body's right as rain, so where the hydroplane

That ass is fat baby ain't no way to hide your frame

Thank God I found you, just holla when you want it

Cause girl your so thorough



And can I hit it I the morning?

Can I hit it in the morning?

Can I hit it in the morning?

The sun rising while you moaning

Can I hit it in the morning?

Hey I got a dolla in a dream
But it's all a nigga got so it's about that green
And I'm all up in that spot
Hey

[Verse 1:]

Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted

The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive

Money and clothes I done dreamed about

And all the hoes that I thinked about

Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I neva had

Waving gats instead of flags the American dream

Why do we cling to the villians?

Knowing they killin'

My niggas high enough to swaing from the ceiling

Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook

Filled with dreams, this is my whole book

Still the screams from girls shot and killed fill my head on a daily

At times I question God can you blame me they can't tame me?

My voice screech through the street I'm a beast on em

Oh no he will not fold you will not see a priest on him

He will not slip or lose his grip they got them cleats on em

But never will he run unless you call police on em



[Chorus:]

One time, two times, three times

Sometimes I scrap sometimes I'm throwin up the peace sign

It's two sides to a nigga though

I said It's two sides to a nigga yo

Ey look sometimes I'm feeling high

Then I'm feeling low

Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know

You say you know me but what side did you get to know?

It's two sides to a nigga yo yo yo



[Verse 2:]

Yeah some pussy niggas put out on me and my mans

Wasn't for the pistol we drop em right there where he stands

But still we never ran foolish pride made us stand right there

Not understanding we could lose our life there

And then the hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance

Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin

Type of nose ass niggas to watching the fight until it's over

They ran when the gatts came out, I moved closer

Foolish what was I thinking? wasn't trying to be cool it's

Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger

When a stranger get to violating

He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I, ll annihilate him

I'm tired of wait on my ticket out this motherfucka

Hope they don't kill me before I get up out this motherfucka

I gotta go,

Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know

Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell

The two faces of the Ville

One side dreams, the other sides real

One side schemes, the other side deals

What the pain brings another mother cry still

Why the fuck am I here God?

That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?

I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me

And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me

Bless homie we breathin

Cold world got me sneezing

Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even

Though it blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen

In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit

How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the hoe

My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before

I'm stressing in my mind but it's way to late to stop it

Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket

Let's change the topic

Before I go berserk

I'm so alert, riding down 95

Naw I ain't finna to go to work

I'm headed back home ain't staying that long

I'm chasing dreams shawty I'm paying back loans

I'm paying dues that a nigga paying tax on

I'm tryina blow like a nigga playing saxophone

I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter

Don't worry even Jesus never saw his real father

I don't bother me at all though

Yeah say it don't bother me

They got me thinking bout my mom though

Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like



[Outro:]

Hey don't cry hey ohh no

We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more

We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid

We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed

Hey don't cry hey ohh no

We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more

We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid

We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed

You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain't stopping for the red lights
Look in my rear view all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can hoe
They try and sack me and I scramble

Look up in the sky you'll see exactly where I am bo

Hey, don't you see me man?

Making my wishes come true with no genie man

I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man

I'm on these rich niggas ass no bikini man

I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man

Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man

Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope

Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost

Silly head to approach, what's up young blood

Ain't it strange, a year ago today my nigga I was counting change

Yeah hopping trains up in New York city

Though I gotta thank God cause if you weren't with me

Than I surely woulda died

You can throw the fork in me

This my New Years resolution, dawg

No more Pork in me

Want you to feel something new, that's how a dike work

And ask me bout pressure, they wanna see my pipe burst



Not tonight nigga

Yeah, hey

Hey, man, hey



Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely

Never met a baby momma, momma who don't like me

Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me

I hit her til she snooze, like the news nigga nightly

Send her back to you when she no longer excites me

No she bitter with this nigga

Cause he ain't quite me

One things for certain baby, girl you are a wifey

Two things for fucking sure

I am not the husband though

So run back to him while you still can

He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah that's a real man

I was ashamed all along and I still am

We let the lust interupt something real, damn

Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position

I wouldn't say that you a hoe, just made a hoe decision

Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibitions

We both know that's what you wanted girl

I know you listening



Hey

Girl I know you listening

Uh I know you listening

Hey, yeah



Shout out to the bootleggers who supply my shit

The fans online trying to find my shit

And to then-ggas listening but won't buy my shit

And catch me in the street wanna ride my dick

Y'all niggas is the worst, see me like

""J. Cole homie, can you sign my burnt CD""

Nigga please, an album ten dollars

You act like it's ten g's

This food for thought cost the same as 2 numbers three's

So at ease with that broke shit

We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit

You know I feel ya pain, that's why I slang this hope shit

And give you lines that you rewind and think oh shit

These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit

All in her sheets left for a week

But I feel like this is perfect, do you disagree with that

If not than holla back

Use both hands and hit me

And right when you call the law

I'll tell my boy to come get me

Then you, than you start listening

To friends, and then it, gets tricky

They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky

So you ignore the hickys, the pics of chicks and they vicky's

That they sent me, is that real love

You're the only one that I will love

Damn, damn

I could stay with her

At her house, no doubt anytime I like

Don't let you in my life, cause you don't do for me

And you don't act right

Just one of them days

A nigga feel like flossin'

A Stone Cold Stunna, victim Steve Austin

Cool as Drew Breeze, I'm blowing a few G's

Just to hear them hoes say he's awesome

He's awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me

Pulled up beisde me in that big body and stunted on me

Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only

Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me

Well look I'm back bitch, back with an attitude

Buying out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove

Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved

Now I'm tipping the server a hundred to show my gratitude

Easy, told you I'd be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me

Now I'm living just like the niggas you see on TV

VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me

I hit the bar just so y'all can see I'm ballin', HD



(It's cost me a lot)

Big chains, big whips with wood grain

(It's cost me a lot)

My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob

Fast life and till the gas light

Copped the type of shit you couldn't get at half price

(It's cost me a lot)

Look but don't touch motherfucker, think twice

Now I don't love no material things

But I'm in love with the feelings they bring

I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)

Uh, knee deep in the game, my chain heavy

Somebody get the pilot and ask ""is the plane ready?""

To handle all the weight on my shoulders we taking off

Don't wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can't take it off

Cause how I'm supposed to shine without the proper bling

Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame

Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains

Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain

That's 5 hundred years of selling, I'm tryna tell em

Jacob the Jeweller is cooler now he a felon

Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn't nail him

If he could'ntsell him, so what that tell him huh?



My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough

Must be the money like dealing with the Jerry curl

White Range, call that Motherfucker Larry Bird

I got em hanging on every word

Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the Fly
I'm touchin' skies, no puffin' lie
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit

Gon' finally give a nigga leg room and a whip

From a Civic to a Chevy must've died and went to heaven

Like a passenger on 9/11 - please go find a reverend

You see I promise that I'd never change

But that was way before I made the dough and met the game

Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow

And even white women want a nigga - Othello

I'm ballin' with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmello

Now the crib got much room -Portobello

She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow

I sit yo ass down like you was playin' a cello

See, you niggas hated and I levitated further

Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder

So if it comes down, may the best man win

No sweat like a head band



[Chorus:]

Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen

You know it can't get no better for me

No it can't get no better for me

Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen

You know it can't get no better for me

No it can't get no better for me

I'm a kill the game and invite witnesses

No death penalty, I'm givin' out life sentences

Like keep grindin' boy, your life can change in one year

And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere

Yeah, look here I pay dues

My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose

808's so my south niggas feel me

Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me

She catch me creepin' out your house she'll kill me

Is it worth it what's under that blouse?

My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl

If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world

But, do you love me like you used to?

Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to

Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me

Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me

The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal

And now I pay for everything, how you feel?

Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feelin' him

You gotta adapt though never goin' back

Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen

You know it can't get no better for me

No it can't get no better for me

No it can't get no better for me



I can't keep running away

I can't keep running away

I swear I'm coming back today

But if I'm wrong

Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin'
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get home sick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling em, be warned

A lot of shit been changing the time you've been gone

The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner

And went and got baby's the day they got a diploma

Damn, there'll be some niggas missing when you fly back

If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq

Old buddy that we hoop with, with a bad chick and a fly lac

Anda gold chain, caught him on a merc, tryna buy crack

Damn homie, shit, in high school you was the man homie

Fuck happened to you,

Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school

Now you looking like a motherfucking fool

Say I'll be home for the holidays

So when you see me, better holla at me

I gotta get up put this city 'fore it try to trap me

I gotta leave, I wish I could stay

But I'll be home for the holidays

And to those that I used to know

From way before, keep your head up

Come let's get this bread up

Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay

But I'm coming hme for the holidays



[Verse 2: J. Cole]

This is a story bout some puppy love

But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love

Although now I'm on my grown shit

She mad as hell, a nigga still get home sick

I was fresh up off a scholarship

Dressed like a black man in college shit

Got a little knowledge now I'm following the politics

But I still gotta holla at my old chick

So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it's me

She said ""we ain't homies no more""

You go to college and you act like you don't know me no more

Girl, we got history semester seem so long

The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on

So if history repeats itself

When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gone need ya belt

Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind

Just don't give it up in the meantime

[Verse 3: J. Cole]

Man I reminisce on them school days

I know you know them act a fool days

That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed

That trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly

But a nigga had a shot you'd have thought that's where the bulls play

Wished this freshman could used a little Kool-aid

Crushing on them upper clansmen but it was tool late

Buddy she was dating he had the freshest shoes

But the nigga was graduated but he never made two a's

Hey if you're listening we got in to school

But who will pay our tuition man

These niggas crazy

One year cost about the same as a Mercedes (benz)

Four years cost white crib and a baby

Ay maybe this ain't for me

If only I could be Lebron with the strength to leave

The worst part about growing up man the shit just ain't for free

Maybe I can be someone people pay to see

And maybe I should move up outta here to the place to be

To get from a to z ay what you think I'm crazy

If I told you one day that I'm a sign with Jay-Z

And will I make it I guess we gotta wait and see

Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to

Out of the ordinary, unusual

I know you had your whole life planed out

So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you

I know you wonder why I had to choose you

Then wanna take you for granted or abuse you

So I'm a keep it honest

I think it's a little ironic

If I hit another chick it's gonna bruise you

Shit, staring out the window of this plane

Thinking if it crash, I'll never see your ass again

Wouldn't that be a shame

Cause look at all the shit we overcame

Made it through the falme and never got cremated

I made it to the fame and never got too jaded

All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated

Flash forward it's been year, we're the only ones that made it

Shit remember I was straying from home

And where I wanna be was my favourite song

Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones

But I just can't leave you alone

[Verse 2:]

She know me like a book, it's too easy to read my ass

Unhappy stressed, yelling don't mislead my ass

I mean I make it so easy don't please my ass

The shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass

It's true that, true that

My song all on the radio

Who Dat!

Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on

Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on

All this time I've been with ya you ain't used to do that

I loved you ass way before I knew you could wrap

The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that

Calling my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that

We had a deal you ain't keeping up your end of the shit

In my mind I know she got the short end of the stick

Trying justify it, man we finna be rich

And some bad bitch I barely know sending me flix

Liquor in the cupholder, tryna get a sip.
6 shots of Hennessey, I'm still goin strong.

Please numb me from the bullshit that's goin on.

That girl was 5 years old that they just murdered,

And did some wicked shit to her that was unheard of,

You fuckin coward.

Ain't gotta tell em' go to Hell,

Cause that's the shit that make them other niggas sick in Jail;

So you gon' feel it.

Travel the world reppin this city, know I'm gon kill it,

But yet a nigga ain't got a clue... how I'm gon deal with

All the bullshit. Niggas sendin shots my way.

You put a hit out on me, think that I'm gon stop? No way.

Gon have to kill me, or witness a nigga livin so filthy

Young, Black, and Wealthy, nigga for that I'm guilty.

Still see all the fake shit.

The industry overlook me for that I be holding grudges

Wouldn't take a chance on me

Suddenly it's, oh you love it

Let's get a cole feature that's gon put you over budget

Picture being broke with no pot to piss in

And then suddenly your idols is your competition

Used to be God to me, slowly losing my religion

As these notes from my composition turn the compositions thin

Put it out and hope the World sing

We sippin' liquor for the pain that the World bring

We had dreams just to make it up the flag pole

Just to find out that out heroes were some ass holes

Y'all don't hear me, maybe you had the World figured out wrong

When these niggas go from singing our songs to waiting on you

Bout a year later the same ones be hatin' on you

Every other record these rappers be faking on you

We singing songs but we know that ain't true

We know you gotta make the people pay you

Cause either you play the game or watch the game play you

And be that broke motherfucker talkin bout ""I stay true""

Look, some niggas let there dirt out,

Some niggas keep it in 'em

So when a man dies all his secrets go with him

And fame a part of history no longer known

Done did a lot of dirt I'll bury with me when I'm gone

When my story's told, how will they tell it?

Will they say I was a giver or will they say I was selfish

Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint

Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon paint

Wouldn't say that I'm a quitter that's one thing I know I ain't ain't

Will they tarnish, will they taint?

Glorify me, overthink, say they know me, say I'm great

Say I'm phoney, I was fake

Say the things about me they never told me to my face

I was loved I was hated

Just a nigga with a dream

I'm a liar I was honest, I was all of these things

When I'm gone let em talk

They discussing who I am

When they bury me just know I was nothing but a man

Wasn't nothin' but a man



This for niggas climbin' heavens stairwell

Yeah, hey farewell

Yeh, hey farewell

This for niggas climbin' heavens stairwell

I pray you farewell

I bid you farewell

Yeah, ey, farewell

Yeah, yeah



If I should die Lord this here is my will

Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville

Let me relive my younger days just once again

Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin

Keeping demons buried in my closet

But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account

My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out

Those were truly my best days

The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid

Gradually turn into me stressin' how the hell to get paid

Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played

Ok, I'm blowing up quickly

I guess the flow is sickly

But yet I can't forget my past and hope it won't forget me

Got good grades but age can't stop strays so pray for me

Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don't wait for me

Cause I'm trying to cheat death, she had to bury my ass

You know the cliche ""lifes a bitch"" well I'm gon marry that ass

And sign a pre-nup

Think back to when we tore the skating rink up

Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club

Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls

Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the World

No way, came a long way from having mom chauffer

It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure

But now we play the game, when it's over send me back

I swear I'm not gon change a thing

I swear I'm not gon change a thing



This for them niggas climbin' heavens stairwell

Yeah, hey farewell

I pray you niggas farewell

This for niggas climbin' heavens stairwell

Hey farewell, hey farewell

Yeah, farewell

Yeh"

Free from pain, free from scars

Free to sing, free from bars

Free my dawgs, you're free to go

Block gets shot, the streets is cold

Free to love, to each his own

Free from bills, free from pills

You roll it loud, the speakers blow

Life get hard, you eat your soul

It clears your mind, learn to fly

Then reach the stars, you take your time

And look behind and said what I can

Look how far I done came

They say that dreams come true

And when they do that there's a beautiful thing

Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy

I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free

Yeah, hey!
Fayattenam, yeah!
Bitch!
Yeah!

I'm sipping liquor for the pain, pouring liquor for the slain

Nothing else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain

Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent

In my mind trynna figure where these twenty G's went

Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow

Second thought I think I need to speed it up and make more

Time to build, lego, in the Ville laid low,

Counting days still waiting on that shit I prayed for

Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick

Feel a vibrate-hold up, I got a call, old bitch

How she get my new shit? I swear this city too small

Type of chick won't take her shirt off cause her tities too small

I could give a damn girl, lift up that pretty blue bra

Now I'm in it deep, seeing just how pretty you are

And that kitty go hard. Lord, I'm up in that,

Got that type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back

Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that

At the door with a towel on and nothing under that, saying Welcome



Hey, yeah

Yeah, welcome

Yeah, yeah



I let these words flow out, like water from a sprout

Like rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowds

Cause these words go deep, from my soul when I speak

Then the flows hits the souls of all those that I reach

If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on

Will they miss me when I'm gone? - And if so, for how long?

So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain

Sit and analysis my thought sometimes and wonder if I'm sane

Man, it's hard to trust friends, when the paranoia blends

With the marijuana, wonder would this high ever end

Swear I never smoke again, ya'll niggas blow the weed,

Let me take another shot, Men this liquor is all I need

Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home

Nobody truly know me got me feeling so alone

They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingering in my dome

I tell em ain't nothing wrong,

I deal with it on my own

I deal with it on my own



I deal with it on my own nigga

Ya'll welcome"

Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing
Probably cause I never could so if I had it, never would.
Then I got my first lil taste of paper, and I splurged
I guess it's just the nigga urge,

This is the Boondocks, I swear yo I'm like Huey mixed with Riley

Thursday I be trynna save the world, and then on Friday I hit the club

Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses

Niggas get to scraping then you hear the gats blasting Damn!

Older niggas ain't got no problems with me

My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree

You see I can, but I won't, plus I'm saying what I won't

Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep

That's the throat, on a certified freak, while she choke?

As we headed to the crib, yes I let her give me head

So she don't remember where I live, my game is tight,

Baby no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night

No disrespect, I just say it polite

I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life



Like Hov said it can I live? (Can I live)

Aye dear Lord, can I live? (Can I live)

Hey!



Now am I Living to get paid just slaves for a wage (all week)

I can't do no 9 to 5 told my momma (sorry)

I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the (glory)

If you knew me know my life is like a movie starring me

Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams

I ain't reading off the script that they picked (for me)

I ain't pissed, naw could'nt give a shit (hardly)

I be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me

Will I live or will I die before they get to know me

If I go I know the ones that's pouring liquor for me

And I know the fake niggas really hating on me

Knew that I was bout to blow so they was waiting on me

But Oh-no, Lord

See I'm smarter then they know-oh-oh

So hold on, Lord, cause I ain't quite ready to go-oh oh



Can I live?



Somebody told me that it's only one shot,

So I'll be God damn, If I'm ever gonna stop

Promise to my momma I'm a make it to the top

So I'm a keep climbing to my heartbeat drop



Like the phone when she heard the news

Her sister on the other line talkin' to her shoes

The only son, what a thing to lose

More blacks singing more blues

More niggas pouring more brews

Poor dude he was young like 21,

Straight up out that city that I'm from

A real smart nigga, but his niggas they was dumb

He ain't even get a chance to run

Before it landed in his lung

God, breath nigga.

His partner screaming don't you *** leave nigga!

Took off his shirt trynna stop the bleeding nigga, don't you go!

But his life fading slow

Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?

Did I tell my baby sorry from befo'

Won't get to see my son grow

Lord I ain't ready to go



Can I live?

Can I live?

Dear Lord, can I live?

Can I live? Yea"

Now I was dreaming bout a deal at the age of 13.
I was feignin for the meals, I ain't talkin Burger King.
Some of my niggas in the 'ville all they did was serve things.
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing.
Them pretty boys had them gals, spend their time flirting.

All they wanted was some waves like they fuckin surfin.

Hold up now, don't get it twisted I ain't hatin, do ya thing.

I was like a young Simba, couldn't wait to be the king.

Now a nigga is the prince.

Hopped over the fence where the grass way greener.

Look at Shorty ass way meaner.

Somethin like Sarina mixed with Trina have you seen her?

She fine enough to be Ms. Howard, word to Edina.

My money like a senior, watch it graduate.

Now it's time to eat, I'm lettin all my niggas grab a plate.

Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies.

These niggas heard about me now they actin like they know me.



Keep on sayin, where ya goin nigga.

Shit, it ain't no tellin.

(Huh yeah) Ey where ya goin nigga?

Ey, it ain't no tellin.

They keep on sayin where ya goin nigga, goin nigga?

Ey, it ain't no tellin.

Can't tell ya where I'm goin, just know I won't stop.

Good bye to the bottom, hello to the, top.



Pardon the interruption,

A proper introduction is necessary when

Your shit is legendary, man

Greedy niggas wouldn't let me in the cafeteria and.

Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian.

The hoes is librarians, they lookin me up.

She got a Jones like Marion, she lickin me up.

Then we cut, look at how she say my name.

I got her moanin J. Cole, they used to say Jermaine.

I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin, six feet, shits deep.

I was low, just a dolla and some hope, fix me.

Cause I was broke, plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser.

Lord please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer.

I'm a star, Converses conversin with them girls with them curves like cursive.

They open like curtains, cause my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio.

Same bitches used to play me though.



Now they yellin, where ya goin nigga.

Shit, it ain't no tellin.

(Huh, yeah) Ey where ya goin nigga.

Shit, it ain't no tellin.

(Yeah) They keep on sayin where ya goin nigga, goin nigga?

It ain't no tellin.

(Yeah) I can't tell ya where I'm goin, just know I won't stop.

Good bye to the bottom, hello to the, top.



I left the city for a minute, but it's still on my back.

Told my niggas, Ey I'm finna put the 'Ville on the map.

I'll be back, and I'm comin with a deal and a plaque.

Cause I'm I'll bitch, they couldn't make a pill for the rap.

Pourin liquor for my niggas that was kissin em back.

Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap.

Hold up now, don't get it twisted, if you slang do ya thang.

Me I'm like a young Simba, I can't wait to be the king.

Witness the dream.

Straight out that Carolina water I was brought up.

In the city where the skinny niggas tryin to be the ballers.

Ain't no fathers, but the skinny niggas tryin hit they daughters.

Sneakin in the crib, but her momma never caught us.

What they taught us, man them bad bitches only want the ballers.

To start us, we hoopin, now them hoes want to guard us.

Uh, ok so play D, know what I mean.

And I-I, I put ya on the team.

And this life is but a dream.

And I need a fast car, bad broads, fast forward, passport, I'm a fuckin rap star.

Ey where ya goin nigga.

Shit, it ain't no tellin.

They say this life is but a dream.

Well I need a fast car, bad broads, fast forward, passport, I'm a fuckin rap star.

Ey where ya goin nigga.

Aiight, Elite for real one tape dawg and I'm up out of here

Lord please forgive me for my sinning,
I ain't saying that I'm finished but I'm praying in advance

Cause the way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants

Yea ball game-I swear the hoes wasn't in my plans

When a nigga took a chance and came to the big city

My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me

Like, Bobby had Whitney we were cooking up crack!

But them 15 credits had a nigga off track

Picture that! Best rapper since lil Wayne in classes

The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his Bachelors

Remasterd this rap shit you hear the words coming from my lips, bastards

I never crack, I got that chapstick

I practiced til that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter

Now wheres the ladder?

Cause either you gonna whine or climb, I choosed the ladder

Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though

Before you get tossed like a forward lateral

We never tattle, let God handle that

Or let the mob handle that, no soprano

Half black, half white I'm a piano

I'm an animal my video on discovery channel

I'm a beast when my shit hits the streets

These niggas seize to exist like a beach in a tsunami you'll find me in The Ville

In the state of NC bitch if I ain't back home I'm up in N-Y-C

Bout that money probably

Like a fucking robbery but I ain't Jacking

I'm chasing dreams sort of like jeans boy I ain't slacking,

I'm chasing dreams sort of like Jeans boy I ain't slacking

Ay take a hard look at my drive nigga no hacking on my shit

I'm strait smacking niggas strait tagging niggas

Yeah, uh
I had this little bad thing something like them Tens,
She gave a nigga made brain something like the wiz
But you see the sad things fuckin with her is,

Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch so I try to show her,

About the world and about just who we really are

And where we've come and how we still have to go really far,

Like baby look at how we lived broke on the boulevard

But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra

Then all I really want is for her to go down low

Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow

And all that deep shit I was previously down for

Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for

You see I peeped it pussy is power

That proud feeling we get knowing that pussy is ours

And how it, feels to feel that feeling you feeling when you be drilling that shit

Got her saying you be killing that shit

And all the pain the world cause she be healing that shit

And naw that ain't your girl dog you be feeling that shit

And you just wanna tell her everything she might need

But in the mean time it's lights please



Lights please, lights please, turn of the lights

For now everything just seem so right,

And how you make the darkness seem so bright,

Feeling like things goin be alright



Lights please, lights please, turn of the lights

For now everything just seem so right,

And how you make the darkness seem so bright,

Feeling like things goin be alright



Yeah uh

So now we in a hotel mirrors on the sealing

She said she wanna blow L's I hear her and I'm willing

But every time I smoke well a nigga mind gone,

So that every word I spoke well I'm tryna put her on but she couldn't hear me,

I told her all about how we have been living a lie

And that they love to see us all go to prison and die

Like baby look at how they show us on the tv screen,

But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans,

And all I really want is for her to get on top,

Before you know it she workin jerkin it nonstop

And all that neck shit I was previously talking

Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in

And while that sweat drip I am reminded

All the times my brother told me that pussy is blinded

I'm finding, the more I grow the more ya'll seem to stay the same,

Don't even know the rules but yet ya'll tryna play the game

And ain't a shame, for how niggas blame ho's for giving birth

To a baby that took two to make coward nigga you a fake

How u goin look in your sons face and turn back

Then go start another family dog, what type a shit is that

She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax

Laid a nigga down proper like she was recording tracks,

Said I know you wanna change the world but for the night please

Just reach over and hit the lights please



Lights please, lights please, turn of the lights

For now everything just seem so right,

And how you make the darkness seem so bright,

Feeling like things goin be alright



Lights please, lights please, turn of the lights

For now everything just seem so right,

My crew is foolless naw we don't dance all we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck - Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it

Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it

Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it

So high if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes

So yea, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train

It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name

It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo

And all these Jose Canseco wanna text-us like Waco

Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate

Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?

Some next niggas almost slide in but didn't fit in

Naw I aint Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?

These big weight niggas throwing their bid in

Try not to show stress

I guess the flow is protested like a sit in

I told my niggas we would get in

But that aint even half the battle

Stay behind like a shadow

Or you catapult

Not if I had a ladder or not even if I had a rope

I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!





Heaven or hell, you choose

Freedom or jail, you lose

I can't stop em, as hot as the devils shoes

Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys

Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards

I'm nothing like these hoe-like rappers

My whole life practice to be the one

What's it like to be Lebron

They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it

The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it

ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel

Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill

No Foreman, try not to call them ladies B's but them hoes swarmin

Now honey, Ay is it destiny or is it money your feelin

Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million

Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same

No one left for me to blame but myself cuz I asked for this

Headed for fame but in my brain, ?hey can I last in this??

Ay five years I'll probably laugh at this

Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense

I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit

Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit

I pass these niggas, they trynna do it how these other niggas did it

I'm trynna live it how no other nigga ever lived it"

A lot of niggas fail, frail nigga wont prevail here
We seen it all, man - niggas cant even spell ?scared?

A fresh prince but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air

Fuck if you excel I'm worried bout' my welfare

So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid

Soon as my doe straight I throw the wifey in some Dolce

And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves

I get up, look out the window hope the sun shining down on the niggas out there frontlin'n

I hit the street and seem them boys out there locking up some older heads

said ?God damn homie hold your head? and hold your head





I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way

And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way

And if I gotta crawl Imma make it to the end though

Until the top if I climb my way, and tell 'em imma rise

I'm on my - headin for the sky - I'm on my way





Paint a picture and show the deaf what its like to listen

And speak the words and tell the blind man what he missing

For all my niggas doing time man up in prison

Thought you had to resort to crime man fuck the system!

We raising babies up in Haiti where there aint no hope

Aint no fathers don't take no scholarship to slang no dope

Politicians hollern' bout problems but I aint gon' vote

Keep talking 'bout change til we floating in the same old boat

So tell me how I'm supposed to feel what the president spoke

When he aint never had to struggle aint never been broke

Aint even rode through the ghetto aint never been close

Trusting this government like trusting the devil in oath

A rebel with quotes- I Get Up!-

Lifestyles of the young, black and wreckless

A generation of niggas strapped and asking questions

Like, ?Tell me why I aint got shit?

I let this liquors fill my liver with them toxics (as I sip)





I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way

And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way

And if I gotta crawl Imma make it to the end though

Until the top if I climb my way, and tell 'em imma rise

I'm on my - headin for the sky - I'm on my way





To all my niggas paper chasing I pray for your patience

Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cake'n

Taking this shit one step at a time

That real shit is stuck in my mind

But to that bullshit, I'm deaf and I'm blind

Destined to shine, Imma find a way

Cuz hey, damnit these jobs out here aint trynna pay, I pray

Granted, 9 to5 is how you survive I aint trynna survive

Im trynna throw my momma in rides

Imma provide for my seed I'm the soil

I'll teach 'em bout loyalty

I'll teach him that his skin black like oil that's for royalty

I'll show him all the things that my pops was never showing me

Treat him like a growing tree

With this poetry I get up!

And show the sons how to lead not to follow

The present is our gift but our seeds got tomorrow

So please niggas raise your kids

And hope them overcome that bullshit they dazed us with

I blaze this shit and get up





I get up, I see the clouds from my window, I pray the sun don't shine this way

And where I go is the wind blow, momma your son gon' find his way

Carolina where I made it from
Cold world no blanket son
Girls fast how Jamaican run
Puffin on the city where the Lakers from, L-A, L-A, la la

So high everything is a ?ha ha? from me

Dreamin of the days of a Drop 500 and a bad bitch that will go to Popeyes for me

You can never tell me that I'm not hungry, if you ever felt whats inside my tummy

My mom wanting out, is my time running out?

Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?





(My world is empty without you babe)

(My world is empty without you)





A wise nigga told me don't chase that cash

Follow your heart you'll make that fast

Does a stripper love to shake that ass 

or does she wish to erase that past?

Got a nigga in her face just gassed 

like ?baby girl why you take this path??

Stack in his hand trynna make that last, 

all she thinking bout is how to take his last

Rub tities in his face and laugh, gotta try not to look fake in fact

A little more money like a few more 20's 

and you let that nigga grab your naked ass?

Okay he's gone now, roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear

?This aint the life for you baby let me take you out of here""





(My world is empty without you babe)

(My world is empty without you)





My nigga sit back blow in the air

Only getting high cuz we close to the hell

Nigga trynna live like Hova, but well, we broke and that doe coming slow as a snail

Hustle hard til there no inhale

Hit the block like a postman with mail

My brother got knocked now they hold him in cells

My mom broke but she posted the bail

Someway, some how niggas feelin like the sun down even when the sun up

Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust

And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked

But, this how niggas was brung up

A mother just trynna raise her son up

Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck

And the Governor couldn't give one fuck

I just mean crazy like it's fuckin', it's actually crazy,

Nah'mean

Yeah!



Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have

And then I end up fucking with someone I shouldn't have

See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her

But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her

But still somehow she got my mind infatuated

Absolutely fascinated with the thoughts of what she might be like

Time after time after time I had to wait, is-

Is fate procrastinating?

I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's

Or am I lying to myself?

Ay, should I try and get some help?



Yeah, yeah

Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard

Ay, tell me is it stalking if I follow her

Like all the way home without her knowing

Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at

Besides when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at

And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally

And if one day I happen to see her outside, she wave to me,

Imagine what she'll say to me

This ain't no time to be afraid no more

It's time for bravery

No matter if my homies think I'm crazy



This the girl of my dreams

Hey, ay is she good as what she seems?

Uh, or am I lying to myself?

Yeah, this is the girl of my dreams

Ay, is she good as what she seems?

Or am I lying to myself?

Ay, should I try and get some help?



Yeah, yeah, look

I spot her walking in the mall, okay, it's time to grow some balls

If she really gon' be yours, oh my god, I'm walking towards her

My mind screaming stop, but my legs keep walking forward

Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you coming for her

My heartbeat racing, and my hands keep shaking

Say something, you shy motherfucker, she's waiting,

""Wassup girl, don't mean to interrupt

But in the city I done met a lot of women

But you from my dreams, ay will you come true?

I know about a show that we can catch,

Some R&B and rap, ay you should come thru""

She said, ""uh, I love too, except I don't like rap

Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that""

Damn! Man,

Okay, you say you got a man,

I mean, I definitely understand, I'm happy for you, really am,

I couldn't have been the only fan in the world Of a girl like you

I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude

It ain't no biggie, well I'm sure that I'm gon' see you around the city

Only thing I ask if shit don't work out for y'all, don't forget me

And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene

I came up with a world-class scheme to get



The girl of my dreams

Uh, ay is she good as what she seems?

Uh, or am I lying to myself?

Or should I try and get some help?

This is the girl of my dreams

Ay is she good as what she seems?

Or am I lying to myself?

Ay should I try and get some help?



Yeah, yeah

So I find out the nigga name, know exactly where he stayin'

Find out when he leave for work, hold up nigga, is you sane?

I'm a follow in my car; I'm a cut in front of his

Run him right into the wall, maybe even off the bridge

I give her a little time, then console her while she crying

She gon' take that as a sign; finally she will be mine

I'll be king, and she'll be queen when I hit her with ring

At the wedding, who gon' sing?



This the girl of my dreams

Is she good as what she seems?

Or am I lying to myself?

Ay should I try and get some help?

Ay, this is the girl of my dreams

Is she good as what she seems?

Or am I lying to myself?

Think I should I try and get some help?

See I seen how she glance and look away like she want it

I ain't saying I'm a fuck her but I could if I wanted

Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worst

It's because times been hard, been runnin around trynna find a job

I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o'clock

And it's you, can't even front I press ignore

I still got cha letters laying in my dresser draw

You telling me about all the things you did for me

When I was broke, you sent me doe and that was big for me

See you was there every year when I needed you,

And you were so quick to give I had to be with you

Remember when I used to call you on your phone line

I knew it was official when my momma cosigned

But in no time, a nigga graduated

I hit the real world, baby girl I'm sad to say it

But I was using you, you gave a nigga major stacks

And I know one day in my heart one day that I'm gon pay you back""

Try to tell it to a Cizz-op

Thought it would work, it did not

He told me ""Nigga stizz-op

You know you is not"", wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked

Fuck, this is for hip hop gassed up like a quick stop

They light a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot,

Even if you squatted under volcanoes niggas your shit not

I'm raw but I kid not

Your shit flop, I give props to the legends

Praise God but I give not to the Reveren's

Looking up to the heavens like,

""Where did all my blessings go? ""

You chasing dreams but then you stop, guess you'll never know

I got a show for you to watch heres an episode

Professional, set to blow any minute now

Many women smile, look the lights and the action

And the cameras be calling

You niggas got to log in, bitch you fantasy balling

I snuck up like I planned to be

This ain't randomly recorded

Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that twitter shit

Thought I get a deal then head straight to the dealership

But looking at my deal

I probably can't afford benifitis

Medical, dental shit

Left but I always came back like a rent a whip

Dirty ass game, dog I can run a kennel with

All these bitch niggas who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with

Me I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'

Start talking that ""we"" shit, I pause Nintendo on them

Start talking that beef shit, I turn the Kimbo on em'

I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion

And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope

To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch

These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit

But Cole's flow so cold, swear the devil get sick

How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit

These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it

I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach

Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it

So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest

No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it

Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded

Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated

They hollering about recession so my niggas out here stressing
But bitch, I'm live and breathing so to me that there's a blessing

See life is like a test that I ain't never got no F in

Stepping out today, I got leave the crib

Momma stressing, I pray

That ain't no body gon pull the weapon out and spray

Cause I don't got no strap

And ever since we hit the depression niggas don know how to act

In, fact there goes some niggas there

Hating, I feel the stare

Me vs you shining is like a diamond and silverware

Let ya'll feel the glare I got to go now

I riding through the city with the windows roll down

Shorty holla, so I pulled up beside her

I'm fronting What's your name?

She told me boy you know me don't play no games-

Now look they say you blowing up hey is it true, right up?

I say, Girl they wasn't kidding like your tubes tied up

I'm hollering hey, good God what a day

I gotta say it feels good to get away

Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay

Ay tell me what's work without play

All my niggas hollering hey, good God what a day

Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?

Where ain't nobody hollering bout the problems of the world,

It's just me and my favorite girl, now all around they holler



[Verse 2:]

Okay so word is spreading

That I done jetted to New York- I was just up there doing my thing

So now some folks I used to know is hollering out J. Cole!

I got to chuckle cause I know they used to say Jermaine

So who changed?

What's in name though, when niggas can't hang though-your shoe strings,

Your flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Luke Payne

Even in the winter we bring, feelings of summer Suzan

We get them hooked like T-Pain

And scoop them hoes like loose change

Can you blame me? - I'm just a boy straight out the Ville

These wangsta ass niggas getting played out for real

Your acting like your trill, nigga you bet not!

You talking out your ass, you feinna get your head rocked!

This is where they shooting sideways

Boys getting blazed

Can't afford to fly so we high to get away

Now come here ladies see we trynna get loose, poured up

Take this juice, we gon mix it with this Goose, don't throw it up

Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold-up

The beauty of life - the pain never lasts

The rain always past, the sun don't always shine

When it's gone I'm lonely, but when it's there I'm fine

I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker

The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga

But at night they think twice and walk a little faster

It's funny, 100 years ago I would of called Id a call this nigga masta

How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh

I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning

I'm looking for some higher learning, learning

Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning

You cay I'm easily distracted

I think the problem is I'm easily attracted by the darkside

The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies

I'm trynna separate myself like apartheid

Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane

If I can find a parachute to parasail,

Maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail

Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart?

Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard - nights with no progress

Man I'm thinking like I'll probably find a Locness in the projects before I find this-

Object of my love, this object of my heart

Bound to start drinking or smoking, sinking this ocean

Leaping through the badness hoping I'm reaching for closeness

Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie,

I got a whole fuckig city that's just sitting on me

But yea it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that

Will I drop? I think not, I get up while they stop

Like a sleeve on tank tops, they ain't give it all they got

So they flop, so hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot

Now I'm starting and they not, let me show you how to stay hot

I play not man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog

The same nigga who used to chill in the mall

Yea one, two, one, two, one, two
One, two, one two uh-huh
Yea, uh
Yea uh

Miss high profile caught you shopping on Canal

I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style

Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile

Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows

It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?

Your make up like a mask, tryna hide yourself

It seems on the outside you thinking you the shit

But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist

So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you,

Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you

Hoping this will reach you when you understand

That your value ain't determined by another man

Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand

And you just tell them go deep like Cunningham

And you just let them OD like Len Bias

And that pussy so good he let his friends try it



Losing your balance, yea uh

Losing your balance, yea uh

Losing your balance,

Girl you losing your balance uh, yea

Don't slip don't fall,

Just a get a grip my nigga hold on

Don't lose your balance,

Don't lose your balance



I look around at my city this is SinVille

That boy 11 years old and can inhale

Sometimes I ride around wondering if we in hell

Or why the cops love to throw a nigga in jail

I'm bout to lose it I just had another friend killed

Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill

I had a convo with my soul I asked it ""When will, this shit change? ""

It said boy ""Just use them pen skills""-

And so I write this for my niggas on the corner

Love you cause you my brother so I feel I got to warn ya

This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance

On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands

Damn, better get yourself some goals, you niggas better dream

I know the hood raised you but there's bigger better things

And for those that passed I need a moment of silence

Sssssshhhhh



Yea and don't be losing your balance

Don't be losing your balance,

Don't be losing your balance,

My nigga don't be losing your balance,

Uh yea so don't slip, don't fall

Just a get a grip my nigga hold on

Don't lose your balance, uh

Don't lose your balance



I got a thing for this little mama

She do it to me plus her brain is forreal I'm a... sucka for love I guess

Won't catch her up in the club cause she ain't into that

Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate

Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen

And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect

Other men ah sweat her when we walk past

Can't even blame em' I did the same when I saw that ass

Match with the thin waist, brown with a slime face

Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensai

Now she got me chillenin' with her all around the clock

My homeis beefin cause I never come around a lot

Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same

And ever since she came around I never want to hang

They tell me that it's foul how a chick will make me switch

But man I can't help it dog her mind got me whipped



I think I'm losing my balance

I think I'm losing my balance yea

She got me losing my balance, uh

She got me losing my balance,

But I won't slip I won't fall,

Just a get a grip and hold on

Losing my balance,

Losing my balance"

Long term plans for the fam, we'll be dropping [? ]

Never catch a nigga double-crossing, unless I'm flossing (woo)

In the streets niggas peace war until you force him,

To quarter back them bullet passes, you could Randy Moss 'em.

Gotdamn you niggas got handled,

Niggas only publishing, my style got sampled,

So I switched like a thick bitch with some heels on.

We came a long way from sticking move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning

It goes down in the lunch room

I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food,

Bust moves to the hallway

My niggas posted on the wall, always

Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle

If we had this shit our way

We be standing here all day

But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape.

All late to class with fake passes,

Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing.

They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Damon Dashes

I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes.

Walk straight past my ex and don't speak,

It's all good, probably have a new ex by next week.

I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that,

But what I wouldn't give to go back.



[Chorus]



Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.

Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again,

Yea I sit and wish.

Yo, I walk another nigga girl to her class, with my hand on her ass,

If he say 'what up' later, I just laugh.

Real sneaky yo, gotta keep it low,

Up in math, let my nigga read this real freaky note Kiki wrote, yea

Hooping up in P.E. you can't see me on this gym flow,

But damn Vanessa booty looking sick up in them gym shorts.

Uh, we bag 'em up, ya'll niggas gonna have to wait,

So they passing hate like, 'Damn I can't wait 'til they graduate.'

But some of my niggas will probably never make it,

The S.A.T. shit man I doubt they ever take it, cause

Instead of tryna send a nigga to a tutor,

Them guidance counselors tryna introduce us to recruiters, it's a set-up.

Momma cut the light on, ""Time to get up, ""

Make sure the shirt matching the forces then I head out,

At the time I thought this shit was so whack,

But what I wouldn't give to go back.

Yea, hey,



[Chorus]



Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.

Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again,

Yea I sit and wish.

I'm a little grown, but still reminisce,

Close your eyes nigga, you remember this?

Friday night football game, something I'll forever miss.

After parties in the gym, grinding underneath the rim,

You forgot your school I.d.? Fuck, nigga, you ain't getting in.

In the hallways acting like some hoodlums,

See that scrap? Naw, damn I always miss the good ones.

Them rumors spreading fast with that he say she say,

Twenty people on the phone cause everybody did three-way.

Man we played them girls for the fools, but,

Wasn't no ladies like them ladies from other schools,

Cause seeing them same old chicks got tired quick

She was just fucking my boy, now she all on my dick, gossip, damn.

Another chick pregnant, another nigga gone,

I reminisce on all the chicks a nigga never bone,

Pardon me ya'll I'm just flipping through some Kodaks,

Sitting, wishing I could go back.



[Chorus]



Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymor

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.

Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again,

Yea I sit and wish, man.

Yeah, this shit is dedicated to all my niggas man.

We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones.

Hit and run, bigger funds,

Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny,

So I do what's best for me.

Some nigga chill on the tech, no speak, blaaat,

Some niggas will put your chest to feet

Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted.

Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted,

Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted.

What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!

Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in.

Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is,

Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus.

About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us,

Looking for model divas that barely speak English,

Fuck 'em while we rich, cause when we broke, they gonna leave us,

We earn stripes, looking like zebras,

Y'all looking like Adidas.

We do it for the streets, cause they need us,

Got beef? Come meet us.

Ok I thought so,

Lifestyles of the young, black and genius,

Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans,

And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)

Play with killers hung yack and slung crack for leisure,

And tell a nigga run that and gun clap for sneakers,

Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers,

So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers,

Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?

Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers, (yea) Where my trust at?

No time to think about illegal when my stomachs touching,

By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busted,

I see the world for what it is now,

I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now,

Or go play in the field?

Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!

We all young, black, some strapped,

Them whites had they lunch pack for school, we had our guns stacked.

And all a nigga wanna do is take his mother from that,

But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back.

To kill a nigga over beef and cheddar is even better,

Just one less coon they won't have to arrest.

Fuck a crooked cop three times,

Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine,

That's why a nigga looking like a street sign, (yea)

Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time.

Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind, (why)

Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas steal purse and 'em,

Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yea!

Money hungry, tryna find a meal.

Hunting hoes, trapping niggas,

Lying like they on the pill,

Preachers say we blessed,

But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal.

If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will,

Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel -gates,

Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so,

Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build.

Money goes, the money come.

Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things,

Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks,

The Carolina way.

If you in college then you know the crime won't pay,

Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say,

Cause in Carolina- we thorough,

My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G borough,

And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?

The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'

Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo,

Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl,

So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte,

Yo-

Was just a youngin' with that fresh fade,

Bird chest, legs skinny,

That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny,

Fresh pennies on my feet,

Momma paid for everything I'm wearing,

At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world.

Aw. nigga, but shit done changed since ""Mayne"" was my nickname,

A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game,

Now I'm a man worried about my fam.

Let me explain,

It's like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shit's sprained.

And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle,

Feeling like the world's on your back so you stumble,

And it feels like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble.

Jobs don't call a nigga back, so it's back to the hustle.

Niggas praying for they moms,

At the same time they moms pray for them.

Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way,

But damn a nigga been a lost fate.

It hurts on the usual,

The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral.

(Damn)



[Chorus:]

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,

The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,

I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,

I won't cry (no), I can't cry.

And in this life times getting hard my nigga,

But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,

I won't stop- try 'til the day I die,

And I won't cry (no), I can't cry.

(Ay, ay, ay, yea)

(Listen, yo)



I sit back and watch the news every now and then,

Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash,

Even the weathers bad.

It be the same shit, got my brain twisted,

Like, ""Damn it's '06 and niggas still up on that gang shit? ""

Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split,

Only seventeen, he was finna to graduate.

And like, three weeks some stupid niggas got him for his chain,

But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement. (uh)

And now they telling me this little girl just got raped,

Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop,

Wait, man she just eleven!

What the fuck is up with this world?

Got these grown niggas fucking with girls?

Plus the cops harassing us,

Every week be blasting us, on accident- or so they claim.

Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain, (right)

They killed her only son,

Make her wanna blow her brains out,

Change the channel nigga, I can't watch this.



[Chorus:]

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,

The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,

I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,

I won't cry (no), I can't cry.

And in this life times getting hard my nigga, (yea)

But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga, (yea, uh)

I won't stop- try 'til the day I die,

And I won't cry (no), I can't cry.

(Ay, ay, ay, yea)

(Look, yo)



Take a ride through the city man,

And tell me what you witness,

Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits,

Violence, hatred, real devastation,

Neighborhoods looking like there's still segregation,

Welfare, single mothers, no jobs,

Tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie,

Fiegns in the street so high off of that crack shit,

This nigga thirteen with a GAT under his mattress.

White folks got the road to success mapped and that's all good,

But why don't blacks got that same atlas?

I asked the same question a million ways,

And it seems like I had prayed for a million days,

Still the ills remain, just bills and pain.

Shoot outs and project buildings and children slain,

Skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why.

It's enough to make a nigga wanna cry, but I can't though.



[Chorus:]

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,

The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,

I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,

I won't cry (no), I can't cry.

And in this life times getting hard my nigga,

But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,

I won't stop- try 'til the day I die,

And I won't cry (no), I can't cry.

And white boys mostly, niggas know a verse from Cole be like a signed Michael Jordan rookie card in mint condition

The farthest thing from harbor shit, be honest with me, listen

You know if I want it, I be John Gotti with the henchmen

Right? I mean, it's simple math, a bit of cash can get a nigga bag

But that don't make you big and bad, just mean you rich and mad

Nigga, your pillow soft, so kill the boss talk

Me to you’s a cyanide pill to a lil' cough drop

This the Ville, filled of hard knocks, they sellin' hard rock

More plugs than these niggas use to fill a bald spot

And kill 'em all and fill a morgue up

I got bars forever, nigga, never will a call drop

No hammer like a mall cop

Still the hardest nigga on the planet earth from January first until the ball drop



Yeah, he climbed out the great Ville, that's gangster

He missed meals to make mills, that's gangster

Then came back and gave back, that's gangster

Same chick from way back, he's gangster



Reach my dog for his shit, get dicey

Shinin' now, you never seen a clique get icy

Watchin' my step, tryna look just like me

Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey

Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey

Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey

Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey

Uh, just hit the paper and roll you a spliff, I'm lit, bitch, I'm lit

Just like the Vegas strip, blowin' through chips, I'm rich, bitch, I'm rich

David Chapelle on his latest Netflix

Go 'head, try to cancel my shit

I'll still be on stage with my hand on my dick

Seventeen thousand all jammin' my hits

These are ridiculous times

Lately, my biggest addiction been lookin' online

Where somebody's always offended, I'm sick of this cryin'

Niggas is dyin', victims of time

Self-inflicted, we sick in the mind

What's with the gossip? If you really handled your business, then you wouldn't have so much interest in mines

Breakin' news, I've officially entered my prime

Which is real interesting, this is the point where a rapper would typically start to decline

Somehow I climbed

Right when you thought I was fine, we're runnin' a little behind

Nipsey was tryin' to tell you this a marathon

Only listen to Minister Farrakhan

Oh my God, it just hit me, it's terrifyin'

I'm a star like the shit on the sheriff sign

If time was really money, I could purchase like two thousand bricks with my spare time

All praises due to my God

Dark days is too far behind

I part ways with the struggle, my hustle gon' always keep the squad paid

All labor, no off days 'cause the money don't sleep

And due to the focus, I couldn't even go broke if I spend like five hundred a week

And talk is cheap, I got a short receipt, can tell by your heart, you weak

One thing 'bout this money, it's easy to get it, but trust me, my nigga, it's hard to keep



Yeah, he climbed out the great Ville, that's gangster

He missed meals to make mills, that's gangster

Then came back and gave back, that's gangster

Same chick from way back, he's gangster



Reach my dog for his shit, get dicey

The trials and tribulations of creation

It's a quiet theme of those in dire need of elevation

One minute, infatuation

Next minute, hatin' every statement you makin'

Constant contemplation

Yearnin' for hooks uncanny, search every nook and cranny for inspiration

Step outside for better ventilation

Smoke somethin', hope somethin' comes from the stimulation

Through it all, stay patient

Get in tune with God

For when lightnin' strikes, it's He who decides

We from a crueler side where the youth get euthanized

Small fries get suicide for movin' pies

All our blind eyes get turned from suit and ties

The truth, it lies somewhere in the middle

Of half-ass rappers and cap-ass crackers on Capital Hill

Ain't no protection for hearts that get spilled

When sharin' with this world with art can get killed

Use your discretion

To believe or not to believe? That is the question

That mean I'm keen on the numbers and I count fast

It's not a rap nigga breathin' that could outlast

We from the South where we learn all about stashin'

Where niggas prone to shoot first and run they mouth last

And if you run your mouth, bitch, you goin' out sad

Whole clique gettin' slid on, you a mouse pad

I'm the one that niggas fear on the lowski

Heard 'em talkin' like we peers but they grossly

Mistaken and it's blatant

Crocodile tears, niggas know I'm on a tier that they don't see

My dogs only shed tears in emojis

We in another hemisphere splittin' proceeds

How dare a nigga rub his hands on this trophy?

I vividly remember who was there



Niggas hit my line when they want somethin'

That's a dub, it ain't love if it cost somethin'

Cole never snooze, won't even stop my alarm clock

Shout to Ryan Coog', that shit was scary to view

Can't take no risk in this game, my money grew, but my ambition's the same

Not a subliminal, speakin' in general, feelings get hurt when words get spilled

I litter it like I can't spell it

They plead the fifth, I'm seeing hints of a trans fella

In cancel culture's vicinity, he's no killer, trust me

Beneath his chosen identity, there is still a pussy, period

Blood spillin' monthly, rather weekly as a myriad of bodies drop

Where bricks get karate chopped to maximize the dojo, comprende

I wonder, will my friends make it past the pearly gates, so we could kick it

But based on what their sins say, probably not

Hit lick after lick like a lollipop

You niggas take a lie detect', the polygraph'll probably pop

You know my zone, I live here at the top

Right now, I'm home alone, Macaulay cot

I keep the shotty cocked in 'case somebody plot to rob me of this godly spot

Why niggas never open up? The answer had me chokin' up

It ain't enough words around to reveal they pain



I'm holdin' on tight to what it feel like to live a peaceful life

Since ridin' a bike, all that I ever knew was beef and strife

Goin' to sleep at night, prayin' that God release the stress

Now I'm on G4 jets across the sеas to decompress

My recеnt checks, how much you think? Hm, decent guess

They growin' more eager, ""Cole, who you gon' kill on a feature next?""

Who would you suggest? My nigga just told me the streets a myth

And he's perplexed, they tellin' on people like the teacher's pet

He took a pull of his weed, he high as the trees where eagles nest

I started chiefin' less and less, it had my cerebral vexed

Too many blessings to be depressed

Went from too stressed to being blessed

Now, my new recipe's just keep that fuck shit from my desk

I don't want shit but my breath, I don't want shit but my fam'

Thought I used superglue, nigga, how this gun stick to my hand

I don't even tote no pistol, but that shit sounded so hard

Plus, I don't give a fuck about lyin' once I learned these niggas fraud

I'm finna burn these niggas, dawg

Bring me that urn-ee, nigga, char

Cole, I'ma send 'em to crossroads with the lost souls

I saw Nia Long quote

I would've poked, back when my heart cold

Give her three or four strokes

Then I'm onto the next, shit like a par four

I'm a raw-ass nigga, 6'4"", tall-ass nigga

With a sick flow, y'all ask Jigga

How much did the kid gross for that label

Paid dues, had to pay dude for my masters, but I'm grateful

Shit, business is business

I'm in the Ville, the windows is tinted

Keeping my dick in my britches, y'all get to the bitches

Me, I'ma get to this money and split with the missus

Nigga, this vicious, and I'm the truth

All of these niggas fictitious

Look at Jermaine, still runnin' the game

Damn, this physical fitness

Fuck with me, man

At a hundred degrees, I freeze the temp

Got my grip and I never proceed to slip

Feel the weight like I just had my Caesar clipped

Got a family to feed, I squeeze the clip

Walk in front of the judge and plead the fifth

I'm a legend but it ain't no need for myth

Better get you a visa, he's a trip

I had Trae The Truth in Ibiza lit



Niggas ain't 'bout to outwork me

Go to sleep late, still wakin' up early

Look at my belly, I’m hungry

Y’all niggas desperatе and thirsty

You can't even tell thеre’s a difference

Hungry is when you're relentless

Even when one of your idols look dead in your face and he tell you, ""You can't"" and you know that he meant it

But when you Cole, you attempt it

Come, let me show you a template

I had to grow out the concrete

I had to stroll through the trenches, uh

I had to stroll through the trenches

I can't do edibles

My head is spinnin' too much

Fell off the pedestal

And I'm never gettin' back up

Done tryna to be perfect, that shit is exhausting

An infinite force that nitpicking niggas get lost in

I'm scribbilin' thoughts, my pencil is sharpening

Trust in my pen, been tryna limit the crossing

The best part of makin' this cake is lickin' the frosting

And Barry been sayin' he love when I spit like I'm dark skin

And you know what he mean

I got a thirty-four waist

I had a forty jeans

Somehow I still got too big for my britches and tore the seams

There go my Achilles heel

Been tryna do everything

Thank God for my nigga Ib

What would I do with no team?

I wouldn't do anything

I would just sit on this music and hold it

Waiting for some perfect moment

Wondering why it ain't came

Meanwhile the world done changed

Suddenly songs I was loving last year don't feel the same

Somebody feel my pain

Please, somebody say I changed

All of these years done passed, I hope I ain't still the same

All of these songs I'm on, ain't nobody kill Jermaine

Isn't that rather strange?

I wrote a number of bad refrains

But isn't that life, dude?

Make a few hits but you gotta live with the strikes too

Instead of pretending I'm some incredible nigga, just let 'em hear all of it

The good, the bad, the ugly, the strong, the weak, it's me

The nigga that thought of it

All the portrayals of anything different or fraudulent

You wanna tap into your greatness, well this is the starter kit

The Fall Off, how many these bullets can fit in the cartridges

I'm lettin' 'em off on intentions to rip through your cartilage

My nigga just told me, ""You trippin' for thinkin' of callin' quits,""



No lie

God is good, forreal

I'm just sittin' here askin' myself

The fuck was I even doin' here?

Fresh out the hospital bed, one to the back

Arm in a sling

And in the same breath, I'm in Ibiza

I ain't never fathomed seeing another side of this shit

I know you felt the same

Hell, I remember we used to pray for it, but hell

Look at ya', bro

People speak greatness these days when the name get mentioned

But what is greatness?

Nah, nigga we lit

Iconic, haha

It ain't over 'til we tap out

Cole, you better make these niggas feel you

We done seen 'em come

We done seen 'em go

From the Come Up to the Fall Off

And even when we fall off, we don't fall off, nigga"

Slugs took my nigga's soul, drugs took another one

The rap beef ain't realer than the shit I seen in Cumberland

Stat stuffers, triple-double, get your ass black duffled

Body bag, body bag, body bag

Cole World your instructor for pilates class

Get a nigga stretched if I feel the disrespect, uh

Your arms might be too short to box with the god

Who live his life without the pressures of a constant facade

I pray for peace, but if a nigga cease these positive vibes

A Falcon 9 inside my pocket, bitch, this rocket gon' fly

Now it's poppin' outside like the top of July

My text flooded with the hunger for a toxic reply

I'm hesitant, I love my brother, but I'm not gonna lie

I'm powered up for real, that shit would feel like swattin' a fly

Four albums in twelve years, nigga, I can divide

Shit, if this is what you want, I'm indulgin' in violence

Put pictures in my home, aim the chrome at your eyelids

Fly pebbles at your dome, we the Stone Temple Pilots

This is merely a warning shot to back niggas down

Back in the town where they whippin' work and traffickin' pounds

My jack jumpin' 'bout a rapper makin' blasphemous sounds

Switchin' sides like the tassel on the cap and the gown

I'm fully loaded, nigga, I can drop two classics right now

So many shells left on the ground, it make the Easter Bunny proud

I get up, dust my clothes off, sleep is the cousin of death

No plans to doze off, the streets, it don't come with a ref'

I never sold soft, just creeped where the hustlers crept

And got they O's off, you reach, niggas uppin' like Steph

To blow your nose off, gesundheit, and then resume flight

As if it never happened, shit we witnessed full of so much sickness

Angels sheddin' tears in Heaven, word to Eric Clapton

Not really the hustler instincts

Therefore, often, my pockets was empty

So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies

Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty

Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty

It's my time now, my world, my life, my life



Say what? The stuff that I've seen got me traumatized

I let the K go when Johnny died

Swangin' that muhfucka' side to side

We don't participate, ain't with that squashin' shit, all we believe in is homicide

I got a good heart, so I send teddy bears every time we make they mommas cry

I pray that my past ain't ahead of me (21)

If you betray me, you dead to me (21)

I disrespect you respectfully (Straight up)

I got some partners who left this Earth

Maybe the pain made a better me (On God)

Just know that they secrets is kept with them (On God)

I feel like the streets is in debt with me (Straight up)

I gave my heart away to all the dawg hoes 'cause that's who accepted me (21)

I blame my pops for that shit 'cause if he didn't fail, he could've corrected me (21)

You want my money or wanna have sex with me?

Can't let the opps or the law get the best of me

What it's like to be nice as fuck but got to stress to pay the bills

That was me in '08, seein’ no cake

Not even on dates I celebrated my birth

Just did the mental math and calculated my worth

Shit crazy, didn't know I got more M's than a real Slim Shady video (How many of us in here?)

Big Boss, less Rick Ross, more like a wavy Hideo

Kojima, they tote steamers around the way we tippy-toe

'Round crack vials and cold-blooded killers, no reptiles

Just projectiles, from niggas salty you rockin' the fresher textiles

I seen best pals grow up and switch (I hate to see it)

Sometimes over a couple dollars, more often over a bitch (Ah, I hate to see it)

I can cap and say that I never scratched my jealousy's itch

But thank God I conquered that 'cause if not I'd never be rich

Envy, keep your pockets empty, so just focus on you

If you broke and clownin' a millionaire, the joke is on you

Money ain't everything, I never say that (Never)

But niggas throw stones knowin' they sell soul to get wherever they at (Come on, man)

Just know these verses is some shit they gon' forever playback, nigga (Come on, nigga)



Hell yeah (Ooh)

Fuck, you know what it is, nigga

Don't even dare

Niggas try to act like they don't—, bitch

That's why I gotta flex sometimes

'Cause niggas just try to act like you just not that motherfuckin' nigga, like

Like you just really don't do it how you do it

Like niggas will really try to act like you don't do what you do

Nigga look you dead in your face

And really act like you don't do it to the level that you do it

That's why sometimes you gotta come through and just do it at the level that you do it in front of every nigga face

So they know the difference between you, the real niggas, and the mothafuckin' fraudulent niggas, man

Don't never get it fucked up

If a nigga can't do it like you do it sometimes you gotta do it in front of his fuckin' face so he'll know forever

Damn, that nigga did it how I always wanted to do it and I'll never be able to do it like that

Bitch it's a difference (Ah)

(These are the same ones telling our people what we are and we aren't because we're just not working hard enough

And that mentality is what we're up against today

But this is good to know because this time, when we march on the Capitol

You can go ahead and let 'em know long before we get there, we're coming to get that check)"

Yeah, nigga, 26

The job still ain't done

Straight up

But I, I said, ""You, you know what I'm here for""



Back on top, punchin' the clock, clutchin' sanity

I got more cribs than Habitat for Humanity

Shit profound, we propagating more profanity

Paid off collections from recollections of calamity (Oh shit, look, that nigga gonna shoot)

The shit pop off, I learned to duck under the canopy (Oh shit, run, nigga, run)

'Til it cool off, they murked a nigga right in front of me

Told him to come off his chain for tryna floss

Died over a cross just like the start of Christianity

When I was a boy, the teacher often reprimanded me (Jermaine)

Thought it was toys, it was a Glock this nigga handed me

I busted the trees, was barely strong enough to squeeze

Bullets traveled through leaves, it probably killed somebody randomly

Ran in the crib and played it off amongst the family

Nightmare scenes, the police finally apprehended me

Woke up screamin', seen a demon had his hand on me

Still sport the scar on my arm from where he branded me

Like a Que Dog, my niggas burnin' with the mute off

Loud pack smoke through the cracks, I catch a contact

Triggerin' a paranoid mindset, now I'm back

Teeterin' between enlightened and insanity

Now that I'm rich, I feel nobody understandin' me

All I can do is cut the mic on, holler at you

Can't let the fame scare me off from speaking candidly

All them niggas is so Kane, they started singin' like Danity

Now I'm left here, paid like I planned to be, damn



A lot of times, those situations are, um, are handled way before the time comes

In the summer, I think when you truly prepare yourself, and

With training and conditioning, and things like that

When you cheat yourself, you fail in those moments

You know, you crash, and when you really put the time in and

Whether people see it, or whether people know it or not

You know, it always come to light"

Bright lights pass me in the city, it’s emеrgency

I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my thirties, no one murdered me

Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me

I'm petrified, but moving like I got no sense of urgency

Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be

Pride hide the shame when city cut off all utilities

Pride hide the pain of growing up inhaling poverty

Pride make a nigga feel the way that you would follow me

Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery

Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be

Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy

Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery

Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy

Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies

Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be

Too much money to count, what’s the amount?

I gotta pay a nigga to add it up

Then pay somebody to make sure whatever amount he say he can back it up

Got racks on racks, I'm rackin’ up, stackin' up

You're reachin', I’m actin' up



Break it down, weigh it up, now bag it up

Making five a month, that's regular

Nigga playing with us, that's a negative

Go back to start, that's never

I'm a boss, my closet leather

Ain't no off-days on my schedule

Long as I live, we live forever

Told my twin this shit get better

These niggas done slipped, let me ahead 'em

Got my feet up, I paid silly bands to have sex on the jet

I don't need 'em, that shit in the past, I'm feelin' like what's next

Got my speed up, foot all on the gas, this not a C8 'Vette

I can beat 'em, I believe in me, just tell me what's the bet

I own five homes, glad some of this shit starting to make sense

I'm staying hella focused and I can't forget the bigger picture

I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it

Will I be destroyed?

Come to me with everything, it's starting to get annoying

I'm addicted to promethazine, it's crazy, yeah, I know it

See your smile just one more time
Sometimes I question whether this shit matters

Puttin' substance into something in a world so used to instant gratification

I found this instrumental on my phone while on vacation

Ib sent it a year ago or so

I probably heard it before, but slept on it, you know?

Shit don't always connect as soon as you press play

At times you gotta step away, do some livin'

Let time provide a new prescription, givin' truer vision

I dibble-dabble in a few religions

My homie constantly telling me 'bout Quran, puttin' me on

I read a few pages and recognize the wisdom in it

But I ain't got the discipline for stickin' with it

Now I'm on the way to London, got a show for seven digits

I'm wonderin' just when did I become my biggest critic?

I wanna be my biggest fan, like how I was when didn't nobody know my jams

Today my son said, ""Dad, let go my hand""

Reminded me one day he's gonna be his own man

And my job is to make sure he's equipped

I gotta make sure he not no bitch 'cause niggas bound to try him

If I said I was the toughest growin' up, I would be lyin'

I had a fear of gettin' punched while everybody eyein'

Add to that a constant fear of dyin'

By gunshot wound, the other violent type of endings

I kept a tough demeanor on the surface but was mostly just pretendin'

Luckily my bluff was workin' way more often than not

But sometimes a nigga pulled my card, tryna expose me for a fraud

And with my reputation at stake

I was scufflin' just to save face

Couple wins, couple losses, some broken up too quick to call it

My last scrap was with Puff Daddy, who would've thought it?

I bought that nigga album in seventh grade and played it so much

You would've thought my favorite rapper was Puff

Back then I ain't know shit, now I know too much

Ignorance is bliss and innocence is just ignorance before it's introduced to currency and clips

Or bad licks that have a nigga servin' three to six, shit



Soldier's song, marching on, on

Hoping to see home

If I die before I

See your smile just one more time



Soldier's song

I could be one to lean on

Time will right the wrongs

Won't be long

How can we grow any closer?

How can we grow any closer?

How can we grow any closer?

How can we grow any closer?

Something inside of me's tryna crawl up to the surface

Something is suddenly smothering, stopping me

Stubbornly getting its way (Way), way (Way)

Drowning out the wave (Drowning out)

I've got a reason to believe that I'll turn out just fine

Soldier's song



Lord, please guide our steps

Watch us, cover us

So that every move we make is in alignment with Your will

Your purpose

Please fill us with Your spirit

Keep us forever in the present

For presence makes the strongest fathers

Teach us how to lead

Show us how to love"

This shit can go up, it can go down

Either way, nigga, I'm prepared

Feel me? Yeah



I be comin' in peace, but fuck me

Best beware of the others

This shit deep, undercovers creep

This Southern heat make unbearable summers

Just last week, seen yo' mama weep

Crying 'cause she don't wan' bury your brother

The blood lеaks while the EMTs gotta carry her baby likе surrogate mothers

Woah, thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered

Though traumatized, wouldn't trade it for nothin'

Through hard times, it was there I discovered a hustle and makin' the best out the struggle

I kept grindin' 'til this day, up a level

Respect mine, gotta stay out of trouble

'Cause TEC-9s like to air out rebuttals

Cole World, niggas knowin' what it is

Just in case they don't, I show 'em what it is

Then summer, I do real numbers

Couldn't dare touch it if they sold the double disc

Block hot, niggas burnin' up the street

Shots poppin' and we heard it up the street

It's a war, niggas runnin' up the score

Jesus said that you should turn the other cheek

Voiceless niggas gettin' murdered every week

Dead bodies, smell the odor in the street

My homie' homie got out on parole

He sold more Coca-Cola than the soda industry

Summertime bring the coldest winter breeze

Hella blues like the Rollin' 60's

Christ went to Heaven aged thirty-three

And so did Pimp C and so did Nipsey



I told you, I told you

This shit can go up, it can go down, I don't give a fuck

I done seen it twice

And I've seen the lowest of the lows

And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon (Bitch, I'm back out...)



Yeah

To the left of that decimal, I need seven figures to play the joint

Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint

Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints

And you'll see how I flipped like exclamation points

My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards

Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls

More death than World War II caused

Trash rappers, ass backwards, tryna go toe-to-toe

We laugh at ya, staff strapped up on top the totem pole to blast at ya

Bassmasters, look how they tote a pole

Gotta know the ropes and the protocol

Or they gon' for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code

Made a lil' tune called ""Foldin Clothes,"" and a nigga still ain't known to fold under pressure

Make a diamond, they just rhymin', me, I'm quotin' gold

One phone call get you canceled like a homophobe in this PC culture

Address me as the G.O.A.T. like they call Chief Keef Sosa

In my sectional like a fuckin' three-piece sofa

I'm known as the chosen one

Another dead body lay frozen, that's how it go sometimes

When niggas weighin' coke and not the pros and cons

Well, I ain't with that sleepin' underground like a gopher, so I go for mines

Survival at all costs, every day, niggas get logged off

Bodies get hauled off

Passin' a funeral procession while holdin' my breath in the car, I thought

At times, it be feelin' the devil be winnin' but do that mean God lost?

Just got off the phone with my nigga, he back in the kennel, my dog lost

I brought him 'round close to me before but he

Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet

I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me

Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be

I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind

It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries

My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency

Said, ""Most of these niggas gon' hang themselves, just give 'em the rope and see""

Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me

Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back

Unfortunately we seen the trap

Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly

They fiend to clap as often as the Genius app misquotin' me, uh

Meanwhile, I see that yo' diamonds is glistenin'

I'm glad that you shinin', but need I remind you my niggas is dimin' and nickelin'?

Scrapin' up whatever coin they can find, the pettiest crime, they committin' it

Just to get by for a limited time, the steepest of mountains, they tryin' to climb

I'm here tryna find the derivative, you niggas don't feel me

You see the clout, you don't see the real me

If I was sick, you niggas wouldn't heal me

Therefore I'm healin' myself, gettin' in tune with my God

Slowly revealin' myself, buildin' my wealth

But maybe you don't see 'em 'cause the smoke

Cloudin' your vision from every cigar that you toke

Plus the lean you sippin' which started as a joke

Got you now fiendin' for your next dose, meanwhile I'm so close

Don't even give a fuck that I'm broke

'Cause in my mind I'm rich with shit I done wrote

Therefore I'm convinced that this is supposed to happen

How long has it been since we spoke?

Last night I jumped up from my sleep, I was soaked

Call it a nightmare, the scene that awoke me

Involved you and niggas I ain't know, they was creepin' up close

I saw the heat tucked in they coats

You didn't notice 'cause you was busy countin' dough

I tried to yell, but nothin' came out of my throat

Niggas cocked back the hammers and you froze, in your eyes I saw hope

Hope of a better way to cope with the pain

And the scars, than the lean and the coke

And I swear in that moment I wish we were still close

Maybe I could've saved you, but no, trigger squeeze, gun smoke

I opened up my eyes with a jolt

Heart pumpin' like Usain Bolt

Reached for my phone, missed calls and a text message note

From my mama sayin' you just got smoked, damn, this life is no joke

I met this girl the other day that wanna know my story

She said since the world against me, she all for me

I told her God must've overheard my hopeful wish

And crazy how I never would’ve thought to be in this position

'Cause see hip-hop saved my life is such a cliché quote

But before I grabbed the mic, I was the poster-child of broke, uh

Signed my first deal off the realest shit I wrote

I told my city I'm the closest thing to hope

Used to be barely above water, now I float

Same bitches in my DM’s used to take me for a joke

Niggas talk crow, shit behind my back and then call me bro

Like bro, you gotta match one before you blow

I always leave the message on seen 'cause I don't smoke

When really I don't fuck with half these niggas on the low

And that's just how it go

She go, ""Damn, nigga, that's deep,"" I know, tell me about it

My life be full of stress, fake niggas, and sleep deprivin' like uh



Dreams, all my shit been colossal though

Used to be honor roll, now it's foreign whips I’m riding on

Now everything I flow hot as fuck, I mean poblano though

Me and Lute ’posed to been did this shit, it's perfect timing though

Remember us being younger, talking about gettin’ signed to Cole?

I was so hot-headed then, I'm a lot calmer though

Tryna buy me a brick house when I get comma though

Money gon' help with a lot of things but not the trauma though

Had so many adventure times, we used to run from the jakes

To make it for Southside, we do whatever it takes

It was apartheid when my barber parted my fade

'Cause now I’m pulled left and right by Keshia and Adrinae

All this shit gets so deep, man, I'm hoping y'all dive in

I don't fuck with surviving, I'm only thinkin' 'bout thriving

But you way too afraid, yeah, I know what your vibe is

Always worried 'bout me, that shit must be sleep depriving



That shit must be sleep depriving



I ain't never had nothin', yeah, I had to work for it

Prayed to God every day, even went to church for it

Built from the ground up, played in the dirt for it

God told me it would work out, I took his word for it

We all come from a very different path

Look at what we been through, look at where we at

Got 'em losing sleep worried 'bout what we on

Said I wouldn't make it but I always prove wrong, yeah



Yeah



Turn into a big deal, but way realer than Black Friday

They let a visionary vibrate

Hoppin' through the Tri-State

I got this bird box simply off a blind date

Now I'm in a tryin' state

Turn into a horror story

Broke my heart to the point I had to find tape

Spraying Lysol, sage, just to wipe her away like eternal sunshine

Pulled up in a drop spot like some summer times

Seen you with some other guy, long story, summarize

Writing on the wall, got your message under mine

I been gettin' high, summer crime, ever since

Wonder why ill intent was inside of your skin, damn

Dookey braids, droopy eyes, it was groupie love

Hurt feelings, no cap like bougie clubs

Sat alone deep in silence

Thinkin' 'bout you gettin' sleep deprivin', yeah



I ain't never had nothin', yeah, I had to work for it

Prayed to God every day, even went to church for it

Built from the ground up, played in the dirt for it

How did we go from lost in your arms to arms in a conflict?

Long arm my conscience

Lost in my thoughts

The cost of my art, we growing apart

You growing irate

Stuck in the door of my state

I carry my Gemini traits

I bury my face

Shameful hands, took your hand

Led you astray, as you would say

As soon as we clash, you adjudicate

We were like ""let’s do the break"", 'cause...

She fucked me, tryna pluck a couples bucks like a banjo

She always outta line, making Mona Lisa faces

And we argue all the time, but we fuck like we crazy

She said her favorite thing is face painting

I used to have this white shorty, always hanging with the black folk

She used to bump Black Thought, I saw her using black soap

That's a wack thought, ain't wanna kick her to the curb

Until she asked me, can she say the N word?

You driving?



Young nigga, you don't know nothing 'bout no bitches

Listen



Now as we smoke and ride and reminisce

I'm thinking back to a time when I was young and dumb with single nigga privileges

I had a chick, her name was Loraine, did anything for me

On the day she get her hair done, walk in the rain for me

Pick Sharika up and stole the car, she wasn't ashamed of me

Trapping hard, slept on the floor, and never complained to me

My baby went into stores and did her thang for me

Even ran from police and got it back on the train for me

Lame to me, half of these bitches, laugh at these bitches

'Til the point you go on IG and you can rap for these bitches

Not to say I wouldn't tackle these bitches, given the chance

If it happened, it was destiny, shit was out of my hands

I'm saying...



Man...

They say karma is constant

That means it's just... it's a consistent cycle of...

Good and bad

Coming and going from every source of... life...

Existing on Earth, so...

If I fucked a bitch real good back in the day

You know what I'm saying?

I’m talking like real good and like made her feel, you know

Like the woman that it made her into the woman that she is right now, then I'd expect somebody should be coming to fuck me real good any day now

I mean it's karma, right?

Until then, I'ma ignore you, it's nothing personal (Sorry)

The stress so strong it got me weak

I'm so on, it threw me off (Yeah)

I'm throwed off, yes indeed

I threw up after my threesome

On my threads, had to leave the crime scene like criminals do

She wanna come to my crib and give me a genital smooch

Typical, typical, get the piccolo, skididdle, skedaddle

I sling peen like a lasso

That mean king save the queen from the castle

I grab the saddle

Prisoner to prescription, it's changed, jackal, Jack Daniels

Shawty tryna tell me



Motherfucker, ayy, didn't I say? Nigga, ayy

We can't rap, nigga, we smoking weed

Stop rappin', nigga, this is not a rap session

Around my ankles

Still no stranger to the blunt smoke, gun smoke

You niggas don't want smoke

With angels and my demons on my shoulder like Chicago

Feel like I done struck the lotto when I saw you

Bottom of your shoes make a nigga think you Piru

Used to have the blues, but too prideful

To show you everything

I could be myself around you

Ain't gotta fake smile, you like it facedown

Like you caught an eight count

TKO, Teddy Pendergrass

A nice guy, but see, nice guys finish last

In the bedroom, stealing cover, fight for legroom

You my best goon, come through for me like Neptunes' classics

Get your back bent, silky black skin

If they knew how real you are, they'd probably clap hands

In your presence

Eye candy cool, but with chocolate, got a fetish

Been some things I only shared with you and not my fellas

Called me to stop through

Get you off like cops do

Fire the lighter, let's get lifted (Light 'em up)

I done ran into a lot of wrong niggas with right intentions (For real)

Shit like therapy 'cause you know how to talk and when to listen

Kind of love when it don't change if I'm natural or with extensions

I got you

I heard some rumors, I'm just hoping they ain't true (I ain't listen)

Been living good, but it get better when I'm with you (I like that)

You should know I'm tweaking when I say I'm through (I'm lyin')

You the only one with my focus, I'm the baddest up out my crew (Bad bitch)

He like 'em brown skinned, independent, money-driven, Gucci'd down

How 'bout you get in your Benz and come and give this coochie rounds? (Look)

Like niggas who give me full attention no matter who he 'round

It's cute when he get jealous, a nigga try me, he make that Uzi sound

Master satin sheets grippin', sex that'll have your teeth grittin'

How I end up at your crib? Marijuana decisions (I was high)

A freak for you, ATL, he got my peach drippin'

But you know it's a lie if somebody say that they caught me slippin' (Lies)

So when he get that feeling, he know to call me (Hit my line)

Love, sex, or the money, shit, I want all three (I want it all)

I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit

The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit

The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit

The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty

But that's how I like it, you all on my dick



I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get

I do not snort powder, I might take a sip

I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip

I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish

I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death

I got a few mil' but not all of them rich

What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?

What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?

That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit

Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips

Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist

This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift

Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss

They act like two legends cannot coexist

But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'

If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit

It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame

It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same

It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers

It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane

Everything grows, it's destined to change

I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came

I hope that you scrape every dollar you can

I hope you know money won't erase the pain

To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now

Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground

I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style

I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now

Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice

Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise

This shit gon' be different, I set my intentions

I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

I just poured somethin' in my cup

I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel

Promise I am never lettin' up

Money in your palm don't make you real

Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck

I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel

If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck

Pistol in your hand don't make you real



I'm dead in the middle of two generations

I'm little bro and big bro all at once

Just left the lab with young 21 Savage

I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch

Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak

Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville

Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest

I wish that he had more guidance, for real

Too many niggas in cycle of jail

Spending they birthdays inside of a cell

We coming from a long bloodline of trauma

We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal

We hurting our sisters, the babies as well

We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well

Distorted self image, we set up to fail

I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

Used to practice peace, finna sleep with the piece now

Know I'ma miss you long as I'm alive

You said you need to call me, be sure I tried

I wish I didn't have a song to write

I know you probably follow me with your light



My mama told me faith is all that I need

And back in the day I would've agreed, but now it's hard to believe

I still do not, 'cause I want, 'cause I need to

Believe in something greater than me without being able to see it

So fuck a watch, I wear my heart on my sleeve

Nobody knows my sorrow, nobody knows about the trouble I seen

A lot of dead niggas livin' through me, shawty, but not in the literal

Most 'em dead 'cause they ain't follow they dream

The power of a higher entity entered me

Mentally, physically, spiritually, I'm on a whole different energy

Fuck the world, but I need you to remember me

I had doubt in myself 'cause I used to fear that you would look at me differently

If I ever changed, I'm numb to it now, I don't feel the same

A slave to the feeling, I'm breaking the chains

Tryna balance out the joy, the pain, the sun, the rain

My life and the fame, done lost the game

The gift, the shame, my skin, my veins

My soul done rained so much on my heart

Really I don't know where to start

The irony of finding self in the dark

My nigga, truthfully, feel like it's two of me, I should've been on that ark

A love-hate relationship with my thoughts, I'm tryna shine in my own light

The realest nigga left in my own right

Helping you with your vices but can't seem to get a grip on my own life, yeah



I was on my way down, breakdowns, breakthroughs

Spit up out my debut, gotta say I stay true

Maybe why I stayed broke, I been on a goose chase

Gotta swallow pride when they see me, how the truth taste?

Off the beaten path like Blueface

On the North Side, had to be a Tuesday

Walkin' slow with your kids on a school day

Way past midnight suddenly my mood change

That's when the truth came, in New York hearing rumors

My sister was homeless, convinced her to often

Been years since we talked, number changed

Saw you and my heart broke in a couple ways

I can't believe when I seen you, I knew shit was true

Stared in your eyes and I saw a different you

Skated off fast 'fore I could address it

Hope I ran into you 'fore we both get to Heaven



We 'ight, we 'ight

You opened up my eyes and helped me see the light

We 'ight, we 'ight

You opened up my eyes and helped me see the light, ayy

Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son

I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns

A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun

She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend

She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun

I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby

She call me daddy like grandmama baby

If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy

I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage

An M is my minimum wage

This ain't no kennel, behave

Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray

So in a way we the dogcatchers

How many bullets your dawg catchin'?

Sawed-off, raw dog fashion

Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn



I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch

Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy



Potato over my gun

I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds

When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son

Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?

My cousin might air out the party for fun

Pistol grips get to squeezing

Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson

I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason

Bitch nigga, come and see me

Put some respect on my name

What side of my city I claim

I try to stay in my lane

Took my advance and put a cold piece on them thangs

I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall

Know some niggas probably pissed off

Who would thought I made it this far?

Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all



I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch

Too many opps in here, tell me who you with



I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent

In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit

Bitches call me a jock, all-American

I'm at the top of my class with my letterman

I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door

I ain't never let 'em in

Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few

Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube

I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class

I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2

No back and forth with these rappers

They mention me, dissin' me

No talkin' back, I won't mention you

Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip

They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews

I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool

Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule

They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks

You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool

Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'

I reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool

I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical

They gon' be hollerin' out, ""Rip,"" and they missin' you

They got me started, I might as well finish (Talk your shit, nigga)

I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do

Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory

That poverty stains kept the pain buried

And covered the shame with a dream

We would have fortune and fame

A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry

Now little Jermaine got the same story

As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary: G.O.A.T.​

All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign

The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game

Ville nigga, I was born in the same

Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond

Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics

Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God



You could die today, so be hell to pay

I'm a livin', breathin', schemin' testimony

So don't test me, homie, put that in ya, homie

Put a foot up that ass, you a steppin' stone

All my niggas ain't gettin' no sleep

All of my niggas be chasin' their dreams

Ooh, I'm a force of nature, I can't wait to date ya

I was havin' problems 'til I had to break through

All my tattoos for sure, they ain't never for show

Might get tattoo'd on today, ya ho get the dope

Spend my time makin' love to your thoughts

Gon' get in line, baby, slut up your mind

I met this girl the other day that wanna know my story

She said since the world against me, she all for me

I told her God must've overheard my hopeful wish

And crazy how I never would’ve thought to be in this position

'Cause see hip-hop saved my life is such a cliché quote

But before I grabbed the mic, I was the poster-child of broke, uh

Signed my first deal off the realest shit I wrote

I told my city I'm the closest thing to hope

Used to be barely above water, now I float

Same bitches in my DM’s used to take me for a joke

Niggas talk crow, shit behind my back and then call me bro

Like bro, you gotta match one before you blow

I always leave the message on seen 'cause I don't smoke

When really I don't fuck with half these niggas on the low

And that's just how it go

She go, ""Damn, nigga, that's deep,"" I know, tell me about it

My life be full of stress, fake niggas, and sleep deprivin' like uh



Dreams, all my shit been colossal though

Used to be honor roll, now it's foreign whips I’m riding on

Now everything I flow hot as fuck, I mean poblano though

Me and Lute ’posed to been did this shit, it's perfect timing though

Remember us being younger, talking about gettin’ signed to Cole?

I was so hot-headed then, I'm a lot calmer though

Tryna buy me a brick house when I get comma though

Money gon' help with a lot of things but not the trauma though

Had so many adventure times, we used to run from the jakes

To make it for Southside, we do whatever it takes

It was apartheid when my barber parted my fade

'Cause now I’m pulled left and right by Keshia and Adrinae

All this shit gets so deep, man, I'm hoping y'all dive in

I don't fuck with surviving, I'm only thinkin' 'bout thriving

But you way too afraid, yeah, I know what your vibe is

Always worried 'bout me, that shit must be sleep depriving



That shit must be sleep depriving



I ain't never had nothin', yeah, I had to work for it

Prayed to God every day, even went to church for it

Built from the ground up, played in the dirt for it

God told me it would work out, I took his word for it

We all come from a very different path

Look at what we been through, look at where we at

Got 'em losing sleep worried 'bout what we on

Said I wouldn't make it but I always prove wrong, yeah



Yeah



Turn into a big deal, but way realer than Black Friday

They let a visionary vibrate

Hoppin' through the Tri-State

I got this bird box simply off a blind date

Now I'm in a tryin' state

Turn into a horror story

Broke my heart to the point I had to find tape

Spraying Lysol, sage, just to wipe her away like eternal sunshine

Pulled up in a drop spot like some summer times

Seen you with some other guy, long story, summarize

Writing on the wall, got your message under mine

I been gettin' high, summer crime, ever since

Wonder why ill intent was inside of your skin, damn

Dookey braids, droopy eyes, it was groupie love

Hurt feelings, no cap like bougie clubs

Sat alone deep in silence

Thinkin' 'bout you gettin' sleep deprivin', yeah



I ain't never had nothin', yeah, I had to work for it

Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah

Ah, ah-ah-ah (Oh)



Take it in vain, this pain is a feeling that we can't ignore

Dealer man, hand me more

A baby in a candy store

I got secrets that just can't leave tour

How did we go from lost in your arms to arms in a conflict?

Long arm my conscience

Lost in my thoughts

The cost of my art, we growing apart

You growing irate

Stuck in the door of my state

I carry my Gemini traits

I bury my face

Shameful hands, took your hand

Led you astray, as you would say

As soon as we clash, you adjudicate

As for the date, it was like last June or May

We were like ""let’s do the break"", 'cause...



Self love is the best love

But your love was the worst drug

Self love is the best love

But your love is the worst drug

Uh, I had a yellow girl, called her, ""Dandelion""
She be panty-less, so no panty lines
She's from Campbellton, north of county line
Steady hands, never let her count the bands, though

She fucked me, tryna pluck a couples bucks like a banjo

Had a girl that was a artist, she could draw, her name Tracy

She always outta line, making Mona Lisa faces

And we argue all the time, but we fuck like we crazy

She said her favorite thing is face painting

I used to have this white shorty, always hanging with the black folk

She used to bump Black Thought, I saw her using black soap

That's a wack thought, ain't wanna kick her to the curb

Until she asked me, can she say the N word?

Hey, can I say ""nigga"" around you?

Some nerve

I knew a girl from Jersey who use to love Donny Hathaway

And she was from Piscataway

Her brother pulled a gun on me, she told him ""Put the gat away""

I was tapping that ass, I'll never forget the Saturday

But it don't even matter like D'Angelo and Laur' Hill

I had a country girl from Alabama down in Mobile

At that time, she had mo' bills than me

And she, her, had no time to chill with me

I still miss her, I wonder where could she be?

Hand me the Fronto leaf

Hey, damn bro, I don't think we got no more

Aight, let's go to the store

Aight nigga, shit, but we driving yo' shit

You driving?



Young nigga, you don't know nothing 'bout no bitches

Listen



Now as we smoke and ride and reminisce

I'm thinking back to a time when I was young and dumb with single nigga privileges

I had a chick, her name was Loraine, did anything for me

On the day she get her hair done, walk in the rain for me

Pick Sharika up and stole the car, she wasn't ashamed of me

Trapping hard, slept on the floor, and never complained to me

My baby went into stores and did her thang for me

Even ran from police and got it back on the train for me

Lame to me, half of these bitches, laugh at these bitches

'Til the point you go on IG and you can rap for these bitches

Not to say I wouldn't tackle these bitches, given the chance

If it happened, it was destiny, shit was out of my hands

I'm saying...



Man...

They say karma is constant

That means it's just... it's a consistent cycle of...

Good and bad

Coming and going from every source of... life...

Existing on Earth, so...

If I fucked a bitch real good back in the day

You know what I'm saying?

I’m talking like real good and like made her feel, you know

Like the woman that it made her into the woman that she is right now, then I'd expect somebody should be coming to fuck me real good any day now

I mean it's karma, right?

Shit"

Tryna balance out the joy, the pain, the sun, the rain

My soul done rained so much on my heart

Really I don't know where to start

The irony of finding self in the dark

A love-hate relationship with my thoughts, I'm tryna shine in my own light

The realest nigga left in my own right

Helping you with your vices but can't seem to get a grip on my own life, yeah



I was on my way down, breakdowns, breakthroughs

Spit up out my debut, gotta say I stay true

Maybe why I stayed broke, I been on a goose chase

Gotta swallow pride when they see me, how the truth taste?

Off the beaten path like Blueface

On the North Side, had to be a Tuesday

Walkin' slow with your kids on a school day

Way past midnight suddenly my mood change

That's when the truth came, in New York hearing rumors

My sister was homeless, convinced her to often

Been years since we talked, number changed

Saw you and my heart broke in a couple ways

I can't believe when I seen you, I knew shit was true

Stared in your eyes and I saw a different you

Skated off fast 'fore I could address it

Hope I ran into you 'fore we both get to Heaven



We 'ight, we 'ight

You opened up my eyes and helped me see the light

We 'ight, we 'ight

You opened up my eyes and helped me see the light, ayy



Yeah, hahahaha

Niggas pull strings like a guitar, guitar, G-Star jeans on my sneakers

I'm a real soulful nigga, collared greens inside your speakers (Yeah, yeah)

Ferguson days on Castro

Wasn't no cash flow

But I'm good for the arch, I'm Dr. Scholl's

I'm good for your whore, let me snatch your shone, shone, shone



Bloody sacrifices



Yeah, ayy

Look at what a motherfucker do for the cash and take

They'll be right across your head like it's Ash Wednesday

You got to just get off your ass like your ass is fake

You can't sit, and if we ain't siblings, then I can't relate

Today's shit, I'm Asic, I run shit, I got it jumpin' like pump fake

I don't need nothing but one take

I'm from the part of the city where young nigga keep him a nine like one plus eight

Our politician a fuckface

Corrupt like a Dogg Pound Gangsta

We do it like a small town wager

How I'm the dropout major

Success stories, I favor

Used to cover my scars, out here tryna cover The Fader

Yeah, Pro Tools, knobs, and the faders

Tail picks, as-salamu alaykum

You ain't 'bout static like AM radio, ain't even playin'

I put my heart and my all in my art, I'm alternate

All of them are the same, it's harder to tell 'em apart some days

I thought I'd call 'em out altogether

Rather than waste the amount of bars it'll take for me to call 'em out by name

Caught a glimpse of the alternate world I've introduced to you

Via the studio, got 'em studying our mixtape

I'm from the hood like my mama, put that on my mama

I lay the law down like parliament, all just with a pen and page



I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices



You can't be everything to everybody

I wanna be your lover, your best friend

Your Batman, Spiderman

Fight to polish who and now your rival's in

I wanna damn near kill you to be the one that heal you up

I wanna be the one that feel you up

On nights when you need good dick to cheer you up

I wanna be the one to build you up

A wall worth five billion bucks to keep out the rah-rah

And the blah-blah-blah so nobody try to steal your thunder

Pull you under

Toss my hopes out, Royal Rumble

We done moved out to the boondocks

Built a big house, there he wonders

How somewhere along the way

He went from Huey to Eddie Wuncler

I been so disconnected, my perspective is ignorant

When you rich, niggas don't wanna correct you

Say something crazy, they won't interject

Do every drug that you want, they gon' let you

Dangerous when it's nobody to check you

I be havin' to check myself

Nigga, stop holding that money, you know you got plenty

I be havin' to spread my wealth

I used to be at the crib myself

7 years old, off of Bragg Boulevard

Where they bag up the raw

They gon' stand on the corner, one hand on they balls

And they ran when the cops come, there go the laws

Then I packed up a bag and I trapped it up north on the path of a star

And I ran into you like I met you before

Now damn, me and you goin' half on a boy, sing



Huggin' the block, huggin' the block all day

I had nowhere to go, she gave me a place to stay

She gave me her heart to hold, I still got that shit to this day

She ridin' with me on the road, she ridin' with me in the A

Huggin' the block, huggin' the block, okay

She gave me the gift of my son, and plus we got one on the way

She gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay

I'm crying while writing these words, the tears, they feel good on my face, hey



And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah

If I don't love you how I'm supposed to

And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah

If I don't love you how I'm supposed to

But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute

Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say

""Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made""

You know what he'd say? ""You's a lying motherfucker

Joe Lewis didn't make that much money

Come in here, get your ass out the house

Coming here with that bullshit,"" hah



Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that

Know a couple people wanna shoot for that

I say ""No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that""

Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that

And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that

'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that

I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack

And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that



(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)



It's been a long time since I have felt this way

About something but now, but now

I'm controlling my mind, the days are warm

The nights are cold, the lost is found, I'm found

Lord knows I need something to fill this void

Lord knows I need something to fill this void

Lord knows I need something to fill this void

Lord knows I need something to fill this void



Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now

Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that

Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga

I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell

Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'

Uncle Sam and shit

""What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!



Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense

Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced

I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools

But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools

Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send

Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them

And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend

Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin

One thing about the men that's controlling the pen

That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins

Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again

I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim

Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?

Some older nigga told me to start votin'

I said ""Democracy is too fuckin' slow""

If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know

Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018

Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen

Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen

Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes

Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose

From the concrete, he was prolly rose

Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother

He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother

Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers

So right now, he got two on the way

Still sleep on covers in his mama house

She can't take this shit no more, she want him out

On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out

Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses

She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

Lost in a cloud of marijuana

Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water

Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman

Mama ain't recover yet

Callin' me at 12 at night

She drunk as fuck and I'm upset

'Cause why she always using me for crutch?

Growin' up I used to always see her up

Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye

She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay

I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this

Too young to deal with pain

I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself

So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate

Mama cursing me out

Depression's such a villainous state

I used to stay out later on purpose

Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons

And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero

Tears flow while Al Green blow

Love and happiness

I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up

I wish her son's love was enough

I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""

She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""

I shake my head in frustration

Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut

Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone

Off to college and dorms

Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone

But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone

I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down

She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed

But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds

Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help

Don't she got work in the morning?

Why she do this to herself?

Hate how she slurrin' her words

Soundin' so fuckin' absurd

This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?

Why don't I say how I feel?

When I do, she's defensive for real

Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals

Little did I know how deep her sadness would go

Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'



Something's got a hold on me

I can't let it go

Out of fear I won't be free

Something's got a hold on me

I can't let it go

Out of fear I won't be—

No!

Something's got a hold on me

I can't let it go

Right

Life can bring much pain

There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)

Choose wisely (right)"

Am I wrong, let them know

Feels so right to let things go

Don't think twice, this is me

This is how I should be

I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction

To my nigga - I hope you listening

I hope you listening

This is for the whole fucking 'ville I hope you're listening

Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got perscription

All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-

-Tation, feeling like the only one that made it

And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition

Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition

Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system

Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction

To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in

Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing

Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton

Blame it on trap music and the politicians

Or the fact that every black boy wanna be pimpin'

But they only got twelve slots on the Pistons

Blame it on the rain, Milley Vanille with the disk skip

What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep overseas

Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's

There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see

Type of shit that normally would call for therapy

But you know just how it go in our community

Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be

Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees

And popping pills due to chronic anxiety

I been saw the problem but stayin' silent 'cause I ain't Jesus

This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please

But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend

Without the drugs why won't you be comfortable in your skin

I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in

You running from yourself and you buying product again

I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend

But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend

Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind

And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end

One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day

I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away

I understand this message is not the coolest to say

But if you down to try it I know of a better way

Meditate

Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate

Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate

Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod

The one that came to pick me up

He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck

And he got shot right in the stomach



I put my hand to the sky, I sing

Grateful for the blessings you bring

Thank you for the ones I love

Forgive me for the times I was

Down and confused, I know

What I reap is what I will sow

Once again I find myself

Back with you from my hell

All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back

Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that

All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side

All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate

All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape

All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side

All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry



Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?

Have I sacrificed for fame?

My occupation's on my brain

Thought that I could change it all if I had change

But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same

I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came

They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing

It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range

Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange

How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?

I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'

That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything

Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head

Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead

Shootin' up where his granny live, ""blaow, blaow!"", his granny duck

He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up

Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?

He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough

Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways

The results are deadly

Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me

The little girl I met this past summer said, ""Don't forget me""

I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?

A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you

And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?

If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through

I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through



I put my hand to the sky, I sing

Grateful for the blessings you bring

Thank you for the ones I love

Forgive me for the times I was

Down and confused, I know

What I reap is what I will sow

Once again I find myself

Back with you from my hell

All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back

Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that

All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side

All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate

All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape

All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side

All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry



It's not that big

Well at least, um

God had saved him 'cause he still alive

So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?

Like why can't the world just be all nice things?

Because God is tryna, um

Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn

Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world

He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time

And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world

K.O.D

Choose wisely!"

Screamin', dollar and a dream with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?

Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know

Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?

Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats

Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BoFlex

Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops

God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot

Nowadays crime pays like a part time job

And the drought got me prayin' for a car time vibe

Summer Rain come again, numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon

In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'

Eyes wellin' up with tears, thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt

I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen

And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen

I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean

'Cause you wanna change the world but while alive you never will

'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told

And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old

Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately

My one wish in this bitch make it quick if the Lord take me

I know nobody meant to live forever anyway

And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A

They tellin' niggas sell dope, rap or go to NBA

Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya

Whenever you around I seen it come alive for ya

I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya

Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya

These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now

I saw you in the party soft lips soft spoken

I came and talked to you but homie interfered now

He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken

Some people talk about that love at first sight shit

To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true

But if it is than tell me if I'm wrong or right if

I fell in love with you before I ever even knew

I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened

At times I feel as though I'm caught up In a strange dream

If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you

Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers

But the only real change come from inside

But the only real change come from inside

But the only real change come from

In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry

But the only real change come from inside

But the only real change come from inside

But the only real change come from



Yeah, my chosen religion

Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'

Doin' dirt hoping to God He know my intentions

To see a million 'fore I see a casket

I got a baby on the way know he gon' be a bastard

I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste

When I was a senior I was ballin' on my classmates

Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank

Know I got a angel 'cuz I'm supposed to have a halo right now

My lifestyle destined for a federal facility for my ability to make them birds fly

Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view

And who am I tell a nigga what to do?

I just apply this economics my business ain't got the suit and tie

Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine

I can't oblige dog, I work too hard

So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard nigga



I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide

But the only real change come from inside

But the only real change come from inside

But the only real change come from

In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry

But the only real change come from inside

But the only real change come from inside

But the only real change come from



Yeah, prodigal son

Got a new gun, this one

Don't run out of ammo lately been working on my handles

Can I ball, become a star, and remain my self

If I fall, dust it off and regain my self

Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt

I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt I evolve

I no longer bury demons

I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing



Life is all about the evolution

I give up, I give in, I move back a little

I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

You can dream but don't neglect the execution

I give up, I give in, I move back a little

I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

Time is short that's what somebody told me

I give up, I give in, I move back a little

I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

Too short to keep following your homies

I give up, I give in, I move back a little

I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more



I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands

All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram

Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand

What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man

Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels

Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills

Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield

I call it poison, you call it real

(Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop)

That's how you feel



Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat

Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete

Body laid on the concrete

Look, somebody laid on the concrete

No time for that, ain't no lookin' back

'Cause I'm running too

I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news

Overcame with a feeling I can't explain

'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22

(Last night at around...)

He was 22

(22 year old black male...)



We're gathered here today to mourn the life of James McMillan Jr

A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community

We got to do better, people

22 years old, this boy was too young

Our condolences go to his family, our prayers

We know he's in a better place, we know he's in a better place

But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman

We've got to come together, this is...

This is beyond words

I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse..."

I just wanna talk to the man

Speak for the boys in the bando

And my nigga never walkin' again

Apologized if I'm harpin' again

I know these things happen often

But I'm back on the scene

I was lost in a dream as I write this

A teen down in Austin

I been buildin' me a house back home in the south Ma

Won't believe what it's costin'

And it's fit for a king, right?

Or a nigga that could sing

And explain all the pain that it cost him

My sixteen should've came with a coffin

Fuck the fame and the fortunewell, maybe not the fortune

But one thing is for sure though, the fame is exhaustin'

That's why I moved away, I needed privacy

Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League

Students that's recruited highly

Thinkin' you do you and I do me

Crib has got a big 'ol backyard

My niggas stand outside and pass cigars

Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard

Thankful that they friend's a platinum star

In the driveway there's no rapper cars

Just some shit to get from back and forth

Just some shit to get from back and forth

Welcome to the shelter, this is pure

We'll help you if you've felt too insecure

To be the star you always knew you were

Wait, I think police is at the door



Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope

Hmnn...I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope

The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm...

(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)

I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Well motherfucker I am



Some things you can't escape

Death, taxes, NRA

It's this society that make

Every nigga feel like a candidate

For a Trayvon kinda fate

Even when your crib sit on a lake

Even when your plaques hang on a wall

Even when the president jam your tape

Took a little break just to annotate

How I feel, damn it's late

I can't sleep 'cause I'm paranoid

Black in a white man territory

Cops bust in with the army guns

No evidence of the harm we done

Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang

Only time they see us we be on the news in chains, damn

Don't follow me, don't follow me

Don't follow me, don't follow me



Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope

Hmmm...I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope

The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm...

(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)

I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope

I wanna fold clothes for you

Woke up this morning

Feeling like the best version of me, so happy

I, walked in the living room

And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping

II see a lot on your plate

9 months with that weight

I know you tired so, I wonder how I can help

I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer, oh

I wanna fold clothes for you



I wanna fold clothes for you

Listen, this is a meditation for me

A practice of being present

There's no where I need to be, except right here with you

Except right here with you

Foldin' clothes, watching Netflix

Catching up on our shows, eating breakfast

Raisin Bran in my bowl with bananas and some almond milk

I never thought I'd see the day I'm drinking almond milk

You soft!



I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna make you feel good

Baby I wanna do the right thing

Feels so much better than the wrong thing

I said I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna make you feel good

Baby I wanna do the right thing

That's so much better than the wrong thing

I wanna fold clothes for you



If I can make life easier, the way you do mine

Save you some time, alleviate a bit of stress from your mind

Help you relax, let you recline babe

Then I should do it, cause Heaven only knows

How much you have done that for me

Now I see it's the simple things

It's the simple things, it's the simple things

Now say, ""I love you""it's the simple things

It's the simple things, it's the simple things



Niggas from the hood is the best actors

We the ones that got to wear our face backwards

Put your frown on before they think you soft

Never smile long or take your defense off

Acting tough so much we start to feel hard

Live from the city where they pull cards

I got a Glock 40 and a little nine

Ready for the day a nigga pull mine

Niggas from the hood is the best actors

Got learn to speak in ways that's unnatural

Just to make it through the job interviews

If my niggas heard me, they'd say ""Damn what's gotten into you?""

Just trying to make it dog, somehow

Peaking through the blinds, I see the sun now

I see you're still sleeping and it feels like

Maybe everything is gon' be alright"

Handcuffs keep huggin the, wrists of my niggas

And I wish stuff was different here

But if I had a magic wand to make the evil dissapear

That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more

To bring you Christmas cheer

'Cause what he represents is really greed and the need

To purchase shit from corporations that make a killin'

Because they feed on the wallets of the poor

Who be knockin' on they door, every Black Friday

Just to get some shit they can't afford

Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce

But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount

We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here

What's that smell, where's your diaper shit here

Lay on your back, don't pee right now or else I'll have to get you back

One day when you gon' want to get your way

Yeah I'll have fun with that

Reminisce when you came out the womb

Tears of joy I think filled up the room

You are now the reason that I fight

I ain't never did nothing thats right in my whole life

Got me thinking...



Am I worthy of this gift

Am I strong enough to lift, into a place that I can see

Someone more important than me?

Am I worthy of this gift?

Am I strong enough to lift, into a place that I can see

I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit

Thats the ego taking credit for what God made

Fuck this album shit hey mama look what God made

She's mine

Catch me

Don't you, catch me

Don't you, catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time

I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it

Don't wanna die, cause now your here

And I just wanna be right by your side

On any night that you be cryin' baby

I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes



There is a God

It is a God

Yeah, it is a God

(for your eyes)
Hey
Niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long, the consequences deadly

Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal

Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal

Cause young niggas is hard headed, they letting off

Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause

Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black

Plus it's hot now, the cops outside it's hard to flip a pack

And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet

Like I ain't out in the field like that

I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back

Despite the charges, back to the wall I fight regardless, Screaming ""fuck the law"", my life is lawless

That's what you call it

Ain't got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven

This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic

I try to find employment even if the swiper chargeless

But these felonies be making life the hardest

Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet

Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it

That's why I write this sonnet

If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break

Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it

Let her know my life is on it

(For your eyes)

Let her know my life is on

For your eyes only



For your eyes do you understand

For your eyes do you understand me

For your eyes do you understand

For your eyes do you understand me

For your eyes do you understand

For your eyes do you understand me

For your eyes do you understand

For your eyes do you understand me



You're probably grown now so this song'll hit you

If you're hearing this unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you

In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God

But because you still alive

He got me praying that the spiritual is real

So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too

So I know how part of you feels

Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me

Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me

I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots

And fiends that smoke rocks, I've seen far too many niggas hopes rot

I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance

Now I see death around the corner, apologizing in advance

Don't know if I ever had a chance

At a glance I'm a failure, addicted to pushing paraphernalia

But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once

Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years

My Pops shot up, drug related

Mama addicted

So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging

Blood was staining the concrete

Older niggas I loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet

That slow money, picked up the family business

By the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence

Round the same time is when you came in this world

Me and your mama thinking, what the fuck we naming this girl?

I told her Nina, the prettiest name that I could think of

For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen

I was nineteen, took me two felonies to see the trap, this crooked ass system set for me

And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me

I'm living fast, but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catching up to me

And if my past becomes the death of me, I hope you understand



For your eyes do you understand

For your eyes do you understand me

For your eyes do you understand

For your eyes do you understand me

For your eyes do you understand

For your eyes do you understand me

For your eyes do you understand

For your eyes do you understand me



It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count

Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout

Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated cause the cash running out

Niggas don't know how to act in a drought

See baby girl I realized, my definition of a real nigga was skewed

My views misshaped by new mixtapes

That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true

That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you

They just pull up on your street, let the heat at you

And if a real nigga hungry he gon' eat your food

I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops

Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you

I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views

Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you

Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops

And the cyclical nature of doing time continues

My worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news

I got the strangest feeling your Daddy gonna lose his life soon

And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true

But maybe there's a chance that it's not

And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels

And I can teach you this in person like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes

I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you

For your eyes only



For your eyes

For your eyes only

For your eyes

For your eyes only

For your eyes do you understand



One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling

What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling

I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing

But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling

He said ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing

When times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me

I dealt with the repercussions of my actions

I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit

But that shit was in my blood, you know my life

I know your Momma nigga, send my love

In case I never get a chance to speak again

I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib

That's the way I wished my family lived

But my granny crib was in the 'jects

I had to interject like, ""Nigga what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""

He said ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions

But I've been having premonitions, just call it visions from the other side

I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow, like the time I'm living on is borrowed

With that said the only thing I'm proud to say I was a father

Write my story down and if I pass go play it for my daughter when she ready

And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only, don't you ever scratch or disrespect it

This perspective is a real one, another lost Ville son

I dedicate these words to you and all the other children

Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation

That sent your pops to prison when he needed education

Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better

Although I know that means I would never be brought into this world 'cuz my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesborough with

'lil Zach and Cole World barely one years old, now it's thirty years later making sure the story's told

Girl your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cos he was cold

Not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old

Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues

Not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving O's

Nah your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cos he was hard

Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars

Not because he screamed fuck the law, although that was true

Your daddy was a real nigga 'cuz he loved you""

For your eyes only"

Flow bananas here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest
You knew that already

And turned to the greatest, I proved that already

And if you would like, I do it twice

I just sharpen my blade for a minute but came lost in my ways

This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves

Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days

We used to play before your coffin was made

Just got the call nigga got caught with a straight

Hope he's okay

Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ

Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers

Who know a nigga fall to well, and that's the danger

Know me better than I know myself

I rip a page out my notebook in anger

And let these thoughts linger singing



Don't give 'em too much you

Don't let 'em take control

This one thing you do

Don't let 'em taint your soul

If you believe in God

One things for sure

If you ain't aim too high

Then you aim too low



What's the price for a black man life?

I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight

I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight

Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics

Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights, cameras and action

May no man alive come through and damage my faction

I brought you nigga with me cause I love you like my brothers

And your mothers' like my mother

Think we need a plan of action

The bigger we get the more likely egos collide

It's just physics, please let's put our egos aside

You my niggas, and should our worst tenancies turn us into enemies

I hope that we remember these

Nights fulla Hennessey

When Hov aroun we switch up to that D'usse

Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay

Cause we from where you from

I'm not talkin' bout the slums

I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb

Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun

And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son

Yeah I said son

This is New York's finest

For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate

Like show me New York's ladder

I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it

Never mind it, you'll never reach that

Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap

That's every track



Don't give 'em too much you

Don't let 'em take control

This one thing you do

Don't let 'em taint your soul

If you believe in God

One things for sure

If you ain't aim too high

Then you aim too low



I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope

I ain't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes

I ain't play no games, boy I ain't no joke

Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well


Wasn't nothin' like that

Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time

She was in my math class

Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass

Sat beside me, used to laugh at mad jokes

The teacher always got mad so we passed notes

It started off so innocent

She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it

I was a youngen' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool

But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school

Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her

Got me daydreaming, man what

I'm thinkin' how she ride on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it

It make it hard for me to stand up

As time goes by, attractions getting deeper and deeper

Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'

I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before

She wrote a note that said ""have you ever had sex before""

Damn



And I ain't never did this before no 

And I ain't never did this before no 

And I ain't never did this before no 

And I ain't never did this before no 

And I ain't never did this before no 

And I ain't never did this before no 

And I ain't never did this before no 

And I ain't never did this before no 



I wrote back and said ""of course I had sex before""

Knowing I was frontin'

I said I was like a pro baby

Knowing I was stuntin'

But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son

Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one

But, she don't know what

So she done roll back and told me

""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me

My mama gone for the weekend

So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""

That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'

Baby you done woke my lil' man up

I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when playing on the bed

Teacher please don't make me stand up

I wrote back like ""Yeah baby sound like a plan""

Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man

But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned

Talking damn shit knowing damn well I was a virgin

Fuck



And I ain't never did this before no, I ain't never did this before no, I ain't never did this before no.



You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time

I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time

I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with

And most of all I'm hoping God don't make me bust quick

I'm watching pornos to see just how to stroke right

Practice putting condoms on, how it go right

I'm in a crib now a nigga palm sweatin'

With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection

That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing

And a nigga roll over on top

And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing

No me, ooh girl don't stop

It's time for action

Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practice

But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said

""I wanna get something off my mental

I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle""

Cause



And I ain't never did this before no, and I ain't never did this before no, I ain't never did this before no"

Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need somethin' newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I weren't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I, could tell her how I really feel inside

That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie

She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy

Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side

On the bench, cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly

I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' bout that now

Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry...

When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry

Cause I'm tryna stay alive

In the city where too many niggas die, dream in quiet tryna dodge a suit and tie

Who am I? Aye who am I? (Yeah)



Things change, rearrange, or so do I

It ain't always for the better dawg, I can't lie

I get high cause the lows can be so cold

I might bend a little bit but I don't fold

One time for my mind and two for yours

I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul

If you see my tears fall just let me be..

Move along, nothing to see



I always did shit the hard way, my niggas ? slangin' in the hallway

Burnt CD's and trees like this was broadway

Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker

Some Reggie Miller

With more brown hairs than Chubacca

Whispers that he got it for the low low

Sell a

Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better

Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?

He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back

I peep game

Got home snatched my mama keychain, took her whip

The appeal, to ill to refrain

I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front door

His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though

I told her hello and sat with my nigga and laughed

And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class

I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash, and just asked, 

""What a nigga gotta do to get that?! Put me on""

He just laughed when he seen I was sure

17 years breathing his demeanor said more

He told me, ""Nigga you know how you sound right now?

You won't my mans, I would think that you'se a clown right now...listen""

""You everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you.

So how you looking up to me, when I look up to you?""

""You bout to go get a degree, I'm bout to be stuck with two choices: 

either graduate to weight or sell a number two. For what?

A hundred bucks or two a week?

Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me? 

I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us - 

f they ain't never want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?""

I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear

And thought about how far we done came

From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky

Thank you mama dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry

You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted

I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed

Nah I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly

And show ol' girl what she missing

The illest nigga alive...

Aye who am I?



Things change, rearrange, or so do I, (Aye who am I?)

It ain't always for the better dawg, I can't lie. (Aye who am I?)

Look at me my nigga

With some trees my nigga
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
Thats all I need my nigga

Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched

But now I see my nigga

That the worlds a lot bigger ever since

Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced

Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps

Fuck being timid in the Civic

Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps

I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?

Yeah can I get a glimpse?



Last night I had a bad dream

That I was trapped in this city

Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?

How could you know? How could you know?

Fuck with me my nigga

We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick

And thats the key my nigga

And listen up I'm bout to go and get rich

Stand back and watch if you want to nigga

Father forgive me for me, childish ways

I look outside and all the clouds are gray

I need your hands to take me, miles away

Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but

Before you go I've got to, want you now

And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found

(Who's the king?)

Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt

What you expected from me, I came from the dirt

(Who's the king?)

Money my motivator, the songs that I sing

Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a King

You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go

Will I return or will I burn, never know

Look in my eyes and see the future

But dont sugar coat it



History repeats itself and thats just how it goes

Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows

Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll

Justin Timberlake, Eminem, and then Macklemore

While silly niggas argue over who gone snatch the crown

Look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound

This year i'll prolly go to the awards dappered down

Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile

I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit

Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with

But not Jermaine, my aim too sick

I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick

You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid

I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid

And break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time

And claim that you sick, and fuck it if the truth is

Who's the king?



We all kings

(We all kings nigga)

Kings of ourselves first and foremost

(True)

While the people debate who's the king of this rap game

Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine

With every ounce of strength in his veins

To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it

But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it

Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic

With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates

And falls from the Earth from which it came

It's done

Ain't gonna be no more kings

Be wary of any man that claims

Because deep down he claims onto the need for power

But reality he's a coward

Ultimately he's scared to die

And sometimes so am I

But when I'm in tune with the most high

I realise

The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side

Today I know that we are the same

Are the same, you and I

Different kind of skin, different set of eyes

Two different minds, but only one God

(It's only one God nigga)

It's for all the kings

Cause deep down I know every pore just wanna be loved"

No role models and I'm here right now

No role models to speak up

Searchin' through my memory, my memory

I couldn't find one

Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed

By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God

This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?""

""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""

Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood

I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods

Ain't got no shame bout it

She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch

I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""

But then I thought back, back to a better me

Before I was a B-list celebrity

Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily

Back when you could get a platinum plaque with no melody

You wasn't sweatin' me

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(Love yourz)

No such thing as a life that's better than yours

No such thing, no such thing



Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive

Fake niggas mad, snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive

Don't be sleepin' on you lover cause its beauty in the struggle nigga

Goes for all y'all

It's beauty in the struggle nigga

It's beauty in the struggle nigga, ugliness in the success

Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress

I grew up in the city and though some times we had less

Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed

And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time

But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'

So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?

Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?

Cause pain still lingers on mine

On the road to riches listen this ios what you'll find

The good news is nigga you came a long way

The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way

You think being broke is better



No such thing as a life that's better than yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours

(Love yourz)

No such thing as a life that's better than yours

No such thing, no such thing



For what's money without hapiness?

Or hard times without the people you love

Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next

I asked for strength from the Lord up above

Cause I've been strong so far

But I can feel my grip loosening

Quick, do something before you lose it for good

Get it back and use it for good

And touch the people how you did like before

I'm tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more

Think being broke was better

Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect

To all my niggas out there living in debt

Cashing minimal checks

Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex

And fantasise about a life with no stress

I mean this shit sincerely

And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes

Living with nothin' to lose

I hope one day you hear me

Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me

'Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly

Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got

Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the one's you rock

Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours

But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours



No such thing as a life that's better than yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours

(Love yourz)

No such thing as a life that's better than yours

No such thing, no such thing



Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive

Fake niggas mad, snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive"

Sometimes I brag like Hov'
""Born Sinner, the opposite of a winner""
Sometimes I brag like Hov'
""Born Sinner, the opposite of a winner""

Sometimes I brag like Hov'

""Born Sinner, the opposite of a winner""

Sometimes I brag like Hov'

""Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight

Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade""



Sometimes I brag like HOV, Sometimes I'm real like Pac

Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got

Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got

This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot

You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot

Homie, get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up

My verbal AK slay faggots and I don't mean no disrespect

Whenever I say faggot, okay faggot? huh, don't be so sensitive

If you want to get fucked in the ass

That's between you and whoever else's dick it is, pause

Maybe that line was too far

Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are

And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World

I'm trying to find a new Topanga

And bang her out, no hangin' out

My pop's was club hopping back when Rick James was out

And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute that's strange

Sip a bit of champagne, say ""fuck""

If the hoes like it, I love it nigga nigga nigga

Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga

Rap nerd even copped Rah Digga Digga

Pac had a nigga saying ""Fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie""

I was only like eleven so forgive me

A decade later I be all up in the city

Tryna get 'Hov to fuck with me

With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand

When he said he didn't want it, it was ""Fuck him again""

One day, he gon' regret playing me

Little did I know, in a year he'd be fucking paying me

What can you say to me, I beat the odds like Vegas

I use to rap about haters before niggas was hating me

Now they hate to see a young black man with a college degree

Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me

You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly

I snuck up out the parks where niggas be living heartless

And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli

So I'm on the really, what could you actually tell me?

I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully

So, back with this pen to give back for my sins

Took a black president to tell the Japanese ""Sorry""

But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas ""sorry""?

Never seen his pops cause he's sorry

Fuck the education, would ask for reparations

But I'm probably just gonna buy Ferraris (Vroom)

Please forgive him

According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him

But the Devil run the T.V. so the demons in him, I'm in trouble

Did a deal with the Devil but now I'm pleading with him

Like give me my soul

I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati



These next three bars is dedicated to the retards

Keep on asking me about the Illuminati

Is you stupid nigga? Young black millionaire

Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they could do without me

And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies

Couple more A's I would have been a summa cuma laude

Beyonce told me that she want to cop the new Bugatti

That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably

Well this is awkward (awkward), want to know what else is really awkward (awkward)?

When niggas buy rings for bitches that have flings

When I'm praying I don't see them at the Oscars



Re-adjusted my target audience, cause it's obvious

I've gone astray, losing my way

Like Timberlake produced by Timberland

On that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds

What's playing in my mind? Just the sound of my whole career

Crashing burning, the thing that I mostly fear

Was on track for the first two years

Until I let the Devil steer and it led me here

Now I got to mask my tears, but I



My nigga

I ain't ever letting go again

I ain't ever letting you go

Avoiding the snakes, AK's, and coke yeah

Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there

Man I been thinkin' bout movin' out

What? Country boy in the city in New York nine years

Ran that shit like Diddy

Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy



Nothing's impossible

And all you lame niggas show me what not to do

I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight

She told me, ""Watch the snakes cause they watching you""

I told her, ""Aw baby don't stop! I ain't looking for the way to your heart!""

She said, ""You bout to miss church"" while she riding me

I like my sundaes with a cherry on top

Make that ass drop

Make that ass drop

Make that ass drop



Now if you only had one wish is it devious?

Cause you already know who your genie is

Can't get a cover now your mag on my penis

Like damn he turned out to be a genius

Damn real shit nigga no Pixar

You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are

My kicks hard, my whip hard

I came out the womb with my dick hard

Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard

It be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard

Don't get exposed to these hoes boy knock it off

I seen your mama in a Benz when she dropped you off

Damn now who more thorough than me?

I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see

Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see

Gotta ask myself, ""What mean the world to me?""

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with

A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills

That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with

Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship

Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit

That's the least I owed her cause I tried to hit

On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it

I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it

And I never called back, how thoughtfuless

Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her

In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga

On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative, nigga is to hit and never commit

Now realizing when I hit she never forgets

So every time I ignore the telephone call

Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call

She was hurting, now she staring dead in my face she was smirking

Like, ""Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga

You ain't worth shit, nigga""

Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib

Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed's crib

Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent

No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?

Had a thing for you, even wrote the song Dreams' for you

Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you

Childish shit, you know childish shit

Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit

Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip

Back home I'm grown now, and this city's my throne now

The same clubs that I used to get tossed out

Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out

Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out

Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out

But I'm still on you, still on you

My drink spill on me while I feel on you





Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

Baby, I want you to want me

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

Baby, I want you

And we are, we are, we are

And we are, we are, we are

And we are, we are, we are

Well this has got to be the longest crush ever

If I ever get to f*ck, it'll be the longest bust ever

Love is a drug like the strongest stuff ever

But f*ck it, I'm on one  you feel me?

She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga

Wifin' in the club and my homies gon' disown a nigga

Like  give me twenty dollars, dollars

That's stupid, how'd you get to college, college?

I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now

Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now

Can't help but feel like I dropped the ball, cliché

I used to pop up on you at the mall each day

Typically, I kick game like East Bay

But you got a nigga freeze framed, yellin' please play

For Pete's sake, homie, get it together

Just f*ck her one time and be through with forever

But



Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

Baby, I want you to want me

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

Baby, I want you

And we are, we are, we are

Got me up all night

And we are, we are, we are

All I'm singin' is love songs

And we are, we are, we are

Got me up all night

And we are, we are, we are

And we are, we are, we are

She got me



She got me up all night

All I'm singin' is love songs

She got me up all night

Constant drinkin' and love songs

She got me up all night

Down and out with these love songs

She got me up all night

Drownin' out with these love songs

She got me up all night

All I'm singin' is love songs

She got me up all night

Constant drinkin' and love songs

She got me up all night

Down and out with these love songs

She got me open all night

She got me open all night"

I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life

Yeah, god flow

Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso

Niggas say I live fast, die young, so I drive slow

And pray I die old

In the drop with the top low

Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo

Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know

And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go

I ain't fuck her but I'm thinkin' 'bout it

My niggas say why you gotta think about it?

The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much

If I gotta be frank about it, ain't worth the stress

First the text, then the draws, see first the sex

Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed

Want flowers, cards, and the purses next

Nah, bitch can't get a dollar

Cole on twitter, bitch can't get a follow

Can get a nut, heard Can't Get Enough

Now she fuck a nigga thinkin' that she may hit the lotto

No way Jose, could write a book called ""The Things Hoes Say""

Show a lot of love to my sisters though

But these bitches so predictable

I'm in trouble

Gettin' to the promised land

You don't want problems, I promise man

I take you to the promise land, I promise you don't want problems man



I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right

I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight

I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight

I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life



And I'm going back to school

Only for the hoes and a class or two

Young bad bitch made the pastor drool

Everybody sweat her like Catholic school

Sat next to her in the back of the class

Cheat off of her and I'm grabbin her ass

She like ""Don't you know this shit already?

Nigga ain't you rich already?""

Yeah, but I got dumb as shit

Hangin' 'round these rappers cause they dumb as shit

But I'm back on track, jumpshot wasn't that good

Couldn't sell crack but I rap good

That's one stereotype

Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type

Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya

I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type, no saving hoes

I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches

That a nigga went to school with is major hoes

And they mans don't know, mans don't know, fa show

Had a baby, little mans don't know

Momma was a freak, got it in on the low

12 years later when my song come on, he ask

""Momma did you fuck J. Cole?""

Whoa



I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right

You see them with their wife, like, ""what's up Tony? Hey man, how's everything going brother?""
""Just taking it easy, hanging out with the lady""
""Alright, take it easy now, God bless you""
You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, ""What's up Tony?""

""Hey, yo, where's the bitches at, nigga?""



Yeah, give me my space

Lord ain't enough time to chase all these dreams

I mean I got no time to wait

Love my girl but told her straight up ""don't wait up""

Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked then made up

Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up

Feeling like a nigga got handcuffs on

How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?

She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him

But a nigga wanna be a nigga, be a nigga

Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas

She never understand what it's like to be a man

Knowing when you look inside yourself you see a nigga

And you don't wanna let her down but you too young for the settle down

And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about

When you can't live with her and you can't live without

Oh shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me

Stripper saying: ""Baby, why don't you throw these bands on me?""

And I came to spend, she pop a molly let the motherfucking games begin

I'm running...



Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway

I'm holding on desperately

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway

I'm holding on



When it's all said and done everybody dies

In this life ain't no happy endings

Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance

The preacher says we were made in image of Lord

To which I replied: ""Are you sure?

Even the murderer? Even the whore?

Even the nigga running through bitches on tour?""

With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit

She losing faith in him and he knows and shit

Like what the fuck is a break, don't know how much I can take no more

I give you all I got till it ain't no more

No more tears it's been ten long years, damn near

I don't know if I can wait no more, and who can blame her

You complaining 'bout every time you out, you come back she pout

Sleeping back to back, this is wack

We 'bout to go platinum in a minute, crib acting out

My childhood fantasies of wife and home

But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone

And despite the rumors you hold out on account the guilt

She's has got to spend her nights alone

And she ride or die like Eve and 'em

Make home cooked meals every evening

And even then, your lowest days no longer Superman

At least you got your Lois Lane

But you...



Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway

I'm holding on desperately

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway

I'm holding on



Yeah, unbelievable seen evil that not even Knievel know

At age 3 I knew this world was three below

Listen, even know my ego low achieved the unachievable

Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent, yo

This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though

Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know

Basis, my manager back in the day was racist

I was a young boy, passing skate and tucking laces

Old perverted white man who told me: ""Jermaine, It's all pink on the inside

Fuck what color their face is."" wise words from an indecent man

Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them

And change empower less, brave souls reduce the cowardice

Slaving in the baking sun for hours

Just to see the master creep into the shack where your lady at

Nine months later got a baby that not quite what you excepted

But you refuse to neglect it cause you know your wifey love you

Does you refuse to accept it?

That's that type shit that tell why my granny light skin

Rich white man rule the nation still, only difference is we all slaves now

The chains still concealed in our thoughts

If I follow my heart to save myself

Could I run away from 50 mill like Dave Chappelle?



Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway

I'm holding on desperately

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway

I'm holding on"

A black star, Mos Def, Kweli

Got a bitch on my dick right now

And She just want to sing on it

Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie

I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie

Dance on fire, with my pants on fire

Cause I told her I was sleeping

Cause I creep with this pretty young thing I chose

That she could be doing the same thing I suppose

Escalating new caddy money

Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money.

Crookest smile nigga momma never had the money damn

I ain't trippin' a nigga Jordan I ain't Pippen yeah

Up the steps I ain't slippin'

Tears blood sweat I ain't crippin, Pierce

A song you can sing along with when you down

So I let you know you ain't alone shit

When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job

Delivering pizzas you think she out there getting robbed

Please God watch her I know how niggas do

Half cracker but a nigga too

Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops

How he was a dog now look at you

I ain't bad as that nigga plus dawg I'm a grown man now

I ain't mad at that nigga

But if a plane crash and only it killed his lame ass

I'd be glad its that nigga

Did Kate dirty now it's back to broke

Refund check she used that to float.

Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac

On crack use that to cope.

Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope

Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope

Try to ride the storm out and crash the boat could of drowned

Homie, don't quit now hear my shit and tried to switch now.

Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now

Ain't it more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?

I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power

Fuck it more to you, so I threw you

And it made me ashamed that I played the game

Not for more money like Damon Wayons

Wanted the respect but it came with fame

I just wanted love but it just ain't the same

I took a train down memory lane

And watching little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name

It's like ? Basquiat

He gave it all he got now the nigga don't paint the same.

I guess he can't complain

All the money that be raining in

Spend a hundred thou for the chain again

Thinking old school niggas like Dana Dane

Probably kill for another claim to fame

My brain the same, yeah nigga at least he ain't insane

You ain't crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change.

That's new, maybe that's true

But listen here I got a bigger fear

Of one day that I become you.

And I become lost and I become heartless

And numb from all the Ménages

Just one bitch don't feel the same no more

And Henny don't really kill the pain no more

Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain

Cause I can't maintain no more.

Tad bit extreme I know.

Money can't save your soul.

But there go you



There go you

There go you

Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

And nigga who you, And nigga who you, And nigga who you, 

Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

Ey yo, I walked through the valley of the shadow of death

When niggas hold tec's like they mad at the ref

That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest

Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check? And if so

You gotta expect that to sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose

Cole is the king, most definite

My little black book thicker than the old testament

Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate

Same bitch giving brains to the minister

The same reason they call Mr. Cee ""the finisher""

Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple

Slick with words don't hate me, son

What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me come

Put a price on my head won't make me run, try to kill me but it can't be done

Fuck her while her mama home ""baby, don't yell""

How many record do a nigga gotta sell just to get the cover of the double X L

A fader, fuck a magazine hater

When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later

I'mma drop the album the same day as Kanye

Just to show the boys the man now like Wanyá

And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends

Iced out crazy I wanna shine like baby

Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet

Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet

This is everything they told a nigga not to do

Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do

With the way that people perceive, and what they believe

Money short so this jewelry is like a weave

Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you

Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you

And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do

If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you

Cause I'll be right back grinding 'til I cop another

My partner said that's just the game my nigga

So I heard my jeweler say here go your chain my nigga

This is my chain today

Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy

The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly

It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at

The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at

Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you

But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you

And I ain't got no investment portfolio

But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo

I know back home where niggas sit today

You rock a chain and they always got some shit to say

Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake

He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break

But hey, you know the sayin', ""Fake it 'til you make it""

Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it

And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up

And copped a crib that's gated then that hundred racks, I gave it up

For What

I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real

We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still

I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still

And they all look my eyebrows: thick as hell

Love yourself, girl, or nobody will

Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal

With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels

I feel for you

Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you

You wake up, put makeup on

Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face what's wrong

No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on

You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling

You keep falling victim cause you're insecure

And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure

Cause you see that no one wants you back and it got you asking

So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing

Take it from a man that loves what you got

And baby you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not

Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair

Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care

Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see

That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be, and that's you

Never let 'em see you frown

And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around

And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud

I can tell you ain't laughed in a while

But I wanna see that crooked smile

Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)

We only fronting like the people on the screen

You know them movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens

But we got dreams and we got the right to chase em

Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten

Seem like half the race is either on probation, or in jail

Wonder why we inhale, cause we in hell already

I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?

Yo one more time for the 'Ville

And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil

Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed

Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail

I got money for the bail now, well now.

If you asking will I tell now? Hell naw

I ain't snitching cause

Man, they get them niggas stitches now

If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals

Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible

Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin

No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin



I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall

My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw

And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe

Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest Velour

Fast forward, who thought that I would meet him on tour?

I'm earnin' stripes now nigga, got Adidas galore

Backstage I shook his hand, let him know that he's the man

When he said he was a fan it was to hard to understand

No time to soak up the moment though, cause I was in a jam

Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play

And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning feeling fear

Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career

But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea

Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere

Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit

Said you the one, yo why you make that shit?

I can't believe I let Nas down

Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach, I can't believe I let Nas down

I got defensive on the phone, resentment was in my tone, fuck it



Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals

Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible

Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin

No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin



I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake

I mean, you made ""You Owe Me"" dog, I thought that you could relate

But while I shot up the charts, you mean tellin' me

That I was not up to par, when I followed my heart

Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind, I kept on sayin'

Where's the hits? You ain't got none

You know Jay would never put your album out without none

And dog, you know how come

Labels are archaic, formulaic with their outcomes

They don't know, they just study the charts

Me, I study the shows, the fans, study their hearts

I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out

Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out

Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number 2

Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true

Still no release date from the label, are they insane?

Gooch told me play the game to change the game but on the way

I let Nas down, I got noone to blame, I'm ashamed I let Nas down

But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it



Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals

Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible

Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin

No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin



I always believed in the bigger picture

If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open a door

Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more

The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars

And so, I took the fall like the son of the Lord

On the cross, dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought

For the past decade, if I should pass please let this be my last essay

Therefore I write from the heart

Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art

But I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start

I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal

And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil

Don't cry mama, this the life I choose myself

Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself

This is for the nigga that said that hip-hop was dead

I went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it?

Lettin' Nas down, I got the phone call, quietly I mourned dog, I let Nas down

Yeah, and on this flight, may I never lose sight, fuck it



Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals

Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible

Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin

No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin"

If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Now you chose me for purpose I put my soul in these verses

Born sinner, was never born to be perfect

Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses

Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers

Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless

And violent, and hopeless

I saw but never noticed that the college is right to be

Or that you can be bosses

Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I ever wrote

But know that the realest nigga wrote this

And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you would find it

And knew one day that you would come back and rewind this, singing...



I'm a born sinner

But I die better than that, swear

You were always where I needed you to be

Whether you were there or not there (I was there)

I was born sinning

But I'll live better than that (better tonight)

If you ain't fucking with that

I don't care (yeah, yeah, yeah)



Yeah, this music shit is a gift

But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff

I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist

She screaming: ""Don't let me slip""

She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips

True when I told you: ""You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane""

My roof in the pouring rain

You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, you

Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me

I smoke you gon' smoke with me

Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse

I go Bobby you go with me damn

Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears

You the only one who knows them

Don't you ever go expose them

This life is harder than you'll probably ever know

Emotions I hardly ever show

More for you than for me

Don't you worry yourself

I gotta do this for me

They tell me life is a test but where's a tutor for me

Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways

Ducking calls from my mother for days

Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised

Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say

Except



I'm a born sinner

But I die better than that, swear

You were always where I needed you to be

Whether you were there or not there (I was there)

I was born sinning

But I'll live better than that (better tonight)

If you ain't fucking with that

I don't care (yeah, yeah, yeah)"

All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors

So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg

Don't trip nigga, they just words

Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs

Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse

Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church

Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo

And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo

Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers

He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense

That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'

Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets

Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit

Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit

I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit

In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit

Who the fuck was I?

Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side

Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at

No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back

Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack

I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat

I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft

I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag

Come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be kings
Getting to the money of sins by any means
As I watch it all, pain out, trying not to stand out

Fish out of water, unofficial reporter

Appear, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter

In a city with niggas will leave you shit outta order

So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news

Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead

Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened not once

My nigga visibally stressed in a mess he's smoking a blunt

What could I say, I can't relate to that

All I do is pray for that

This is city God told me, go and make it at

I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that

Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

Hop on the F train, took the express train

Skip that local shit, my vocal sick

That's how success came

Once kings, now we pawns in this chess game

Wall Street got black slave blood stains

Which means, we built this city

And never got scraps while the devil got fat

In fact, reparation for niggas in desperation

Fuck money, get my kid a real education

Blood money spills, had a real revelation

Southside make you realize there's still segregation

Don't wanna preach, I'm just thinking out loud

Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking 'bout how

My motive: to lead my niggas to paradise

Imagine the world, free from pain

And we no longer scared of night

Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind

We gon' make it primetime till we dyin'

To eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake

Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it

Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it

I done been up in everything, cars you never seen

Cities you never heard of, from the streets where they murder

Police observe us till they reach the verdict

Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all

If you can't send 'em to the pen, send 'em to the morgue

Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad

Niggas so thirsty it irks me, you keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though,

Nah nigga, the game is to get, a bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit,

I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass into a craft, now you'd be famous and rich,

But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch, while you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick,

She thinking she got a first round pick, she thinking bout all the things she can get,

she thinking you got a Range for a whip, and a fly ass cribbo, and it's not that simple cause,

All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her

I got a dollar and a dream
That's all a nigga got
So if it's bout that cream

Then I'm all up in the spot

I got a dollar and a dream

Just a dollar and a dream



[Verse 1:]

Walk with a nigga, I give you my pain

So much on my mind I wonder how it fit in my brain

Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart

Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off

Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix

When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke

Knowing it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably

Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me

Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em

They say he wouldn't leave me yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn

Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar

And the stress and this mess you're in can make your ass holla?

Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?

No longer fightin' now the only thing you grow is old

Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?

Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king

Cole!

Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti

You paper, confetti, small time, y'all on one, I'm on mine

You logged off cause I'm online, small talk from small minds

I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town

This where I get my dough

My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show

I run the town they tried to call me underground

I spun around like, you wish

Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this

I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit

Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit

Play your part, life is but a dream for me

I get a flash of nightmares where niggas scheme on me

It's hard to see my enemies; who infiltrated my team?

I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem

That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams

I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime

I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me

I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me

You never, have it, I know you want what I got

But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not

And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as

But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me

If you don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay

Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet

My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million

And as soon as I do, mama that 9 to 5 is through

And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' bout you

And all the shit that you been through

My girl and then my brother too

Cause this life get hard on this road, yeah it's true

I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do

But I suck it up for who? My fans, and my mans

Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans

Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes

Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' ""God damn, what's her name? ""

Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame

And then my other side kick in like ""Bitch don't be so fuckin' lame""

Dang, what a life, another day, another night

At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me

Just for those praying for me, man I know that y'all worry

But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will

She calling, she texting, she's falling, but lemme explain

Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl, 'cause a nigga don't play them ex games

No! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting

And I ain't comin' offa my last name, 'cause I really can't take no stressing

Yeah, uh
I had this little bad thing something like them Tens,
She gave a nigga made brain something like the wiz
But you see the sad things fuckin with her is,

Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch so I try to show her,

About the world and about just who we really are

And where we've come and how we still have to go really far,

Like baby look at how we lived broke on the boulevard

But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra

Then all I really want is for her to go down low

Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow

And all that deep shit I was previously down for

Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for

You see I peeped it pussy is power

That proud feeling we get knowing that pussy is ours

And how it, feels to feel that feeling you feeling when you be drilling that shit

Got her saying you be killing that shit

And all the pain the world cause she be healing that shit

And naw that ain't your girl dog you be feeling that shit

And you just wanna tell her everything she might need

But in the mean time it's lights please



Lights please, lights please, turn of the lights

For now everything just seem so right,

And how you make the darkness seem so bright,

Feeling like things goin be alright



Lights please, lights please, turn of the lights

For now everything just seem so right,

And how you make the darkness seem so bright,

Feeling like things goin be alright



Yeah uh

So now we in a hotel mirrors on the sealing

She said she wanna blow L's I hear her and I'm willing

But every time I smoke well a nigga mind gone,

So that every word I spoke well I'm tryna put her on but she couldn't hear me,

I told her all about how we have been living a lie

And that they love to see us all go to prison and die

Like baby look at how they show us on the tv screen,

But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans,

And all I really want is for her to get on top,

Before you know it she workin jerkin it nonstop

And all that neck shit I was previously talking

Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in

And while that sweat drip I am reminded

All the times my brother told me that pussy is blinded

I'm finding, the more I grow the more ya'll seem to stay the same,

Don't even know the rules but yet ya'll tryna play the game

And ain't a shame, for how niggas blame ho's for giving birth

To a baby that took two to make coward nigga you a fake

How u goin look in your sons face and turn back

Then go start another family dog, what type a shit is that

She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax

Laid a nigga down proper like she was recording tracks,

Said I know you wanna change the world but for the night please

Just reach over and hit the lights please



Lights please, lights please, turn of the lights

For now everything just seem so right,

And how you make the darkness seem so bright,

Feeling like things goin be alright



Lights please, lights please, turn of the lights

For now everything just seem so right,

And how you make the darkness seem so bright,

Feeling like things goin be alright"

I was drivin' dirty, my license was no good

Dawg, how 'bout the moment I found out I was gon' get the deal 

A fuckin' cop got behind me and I already knew what it was

I handled it so like, I handled it the best way you could ever go to jail like I went to jail knowin',

I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short, fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelled out, my own pain spilled out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains, Cobain

Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots

I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same

But homie if you change, man you change for the better

Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta

Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'

Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'

Still loved her just enough to put up with the cheatin'

Must go by and only see him for a weekend

I say a prayer, hope my girl ain't leavin'

We all got angels, we all got demons

As you fall through the club

Bad bitches down to do all the above

Money comes fast so bein' hungry don't last

Till you look in the mirror you saw who you was

Cole World, it couldn't be more clearer

The time is now, couldn't be more herer

My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras

Say hello to the real, I can be your hero



[Hook]

Hey, I'm a put us all on the map

Gone and I ain't lookin' back

I knew they gone feel it like they tank on E

I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me

Cause ain't nobody tell me why their ain't gonna be no more

Thinking I'm a fall? Don't be so sure

I wish somebody made guidelines

On how to get up off the sidelines



[Verse 2: J. Cole]

Up in 1st class, laugh even though it's not funny

See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money

While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past em'

Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'

Know what he askin', ""how did he manage? ""

""With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage! ""

Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish

Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners

Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us Bamma

Laughin' at the grammer cause they didn't understand us

Must've thought they slow, but little do they know

I came up in here to take advantage of that shit ya'll take for granted

Opportunity that I would kill for

Lookin' at rappers like ""what the fuck you got a deal for?! ""

When I was assed out with my funds low

It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door



[Hook]



[Verse 3: J. Cole]

I made it to the Roc, even though they tried to box me out

I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out

But what they don't understand is this is all plan

It's a bigger picture and you can't photoshop me out

Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out

Like I'm supposed to give a fuck

Don't you know that I be out in France

Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao

Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky outt

And my lines is designed from the heart

Young Simba been a lion from the start

Dumb nigga's, ya'll been lyin from the start

My life's like a move, truly

And these niggas is dyin for the part

But, you'll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan

Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more importan'

Both changed the game, came through and made a lane

Who's to say that who's greater, all we know, they ain't the same

You can look but don't touch

I'll stay on my toes like them White Sox

And you can't make that back, no you can make that back so

Let's ball while we here

Let's ball while we here

Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year

Stack on black, I ain't never been a high roller

Now it's racks on racks

Never thought that I would ride Rover

But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober

Do that mean that I'm Bi-polar?

Young black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas eve

It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation

Problem with the game now, it ain't no innovation

I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation

And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all

Matter fact y'all need to practice that more

See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight

I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all

Money was an issue, but now that that's solved

I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall

Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle

Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds go to gamble

If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae

Now I do it big and that's my day to day story

I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry

Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me

They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue

I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew

See when you're spittin' so real

Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal

Got em feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal

Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell

At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy

And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see

Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be

I think they scared of me, and they should be

Think about it baby, me and you we still kids ourselves

How we gonna raise a kid by ourself? handle biz by ourself?

Said you love me oh but now you flipping like reciprocals, figures though

Should've known that you was just another nigga

No different from them other niggas who be

Claiming that they love you just to get up in them drawers

Knowing all the right things to say

I let you hit it raw, muthafucka!

I just do this by my muthafucking self

But I still don't understand how you could say that

Did you forget all those conversations

That we had way back about your father? and you told me

That you hate that nigga, talking about he a coward

And you so happy that you ain't that nigga, cause he

Left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit

Could she be lying? and she be crying cause he acting

Distant, like ""ever since I told you this, nigga

But you're perfect for me

Rollin', we ridin'

He like to go inside and

I love to go all night and

We rock the boat, Poseidon

I love to call your name, name, name

Baby I love to call your name, name, name



[Verse 2: J. Cole]

Oh yeah, to my college girl, take the weekend off and come home soon

I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room

But that thing tight like Fort Knox

So I call you when the tour stops

But baby with your roommates, did you make sure the door's locked?

She love it when we get together

Smoke a little weed but the shit together

Now that I'm on, I can pick and choose

Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose

Yeah, I heard stories about different dudes

Her man on campus but it's fine by me

Say she only fucked like 4-5 niggas, so you know you gotta multiply by 3

[Verse 1:]
Uh, angel eyes, long hair
I see you cryin', what's wrong there
He did what? He fucked who?

We know the story, what's new?

See I could probably, rush you

Tell you that he should have loved you

Take advantage, fuck you

Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do

But the truth is, we all the same

On different teams, but it's all a game

The objective, tryna score

You got a wife, you find a whore

You fuck her fast, she find her drawers

Pull up her pants, you find the door

You drive her home, she mop you off

You bust again, and drop her off

Then repeat like an episode

Why we cheat? I'll never know

Is it cause we rap? Heavens no

Lotta niggas rap though, never blow

A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe

Could it be cause my father let me know

That he cheated, and somehow I never told

I never told



""Hey, you wanna be a man?

Yeah I wanna be a man.

A man don't run tellin' mama everything he see.

I ain't gonna tell.

Alright then man. You're a man now.

Okay.""



[Verse 2:]

OK, that's what it is, I see the game

The hoes come, the seasons change

The hoes go, we rearrange

Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same

The old G's that beat the game

Forever young, Peter Pan

35, still playin', child support, still payin'

Jugglin', bill payin'

Been runnin' round, field dayin'

Wine and dine, meal payin'

With hopes that she'll land

The bed and, get wet then, give head then

You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man

Game colder than the fuckin' dead man

One night stands, no best man

No bridesmaids, or reverends

Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man

Cause cupid aims and throw the darts

There go the sparks and broken hearts

Who wanna build Noah's Ark

Just to have that shit torn apart



""You know what? I need to talk to you.

About what?

I don't think this is, working out for us.

Why?

I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all.

What the fuck?! """

There's a nigga right now somewhere
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks
And he's reading the back of the cereal
And in between the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit
And he wants my spot

I'm a find him though, I'm a sign him...

I don't want no problems



[Verse 1: J. Cole]

Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind

Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was assigned

Took my time, crept from behind

And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine!

Cole World, same nigga used to drive around with yo girl

In my mama's Civic, now I'm our here tryna get it

I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it

So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't got a mimic

Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit

I ain't got a gimmick I just flow and niggas went nuts for

The boy that set fire to the booth

In a game full of liars it turns out that I'm the truth

Some say that raps alive, it turns out that I'm the proof

Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots

The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose

Let these words be my bullets nigga, I don't rhyme I shoot

Bang!



[Hook: J Cole]

Where the fuck I went?

I pray to the Lord, my soul to take



[Verse 2: J. cole]

Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich fore I see my life caper

Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker

Our hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker

But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan

More than a rapper this a natural disaster

Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina

""Shut up, Cole! "", this is for my niggas back home

Homes, waddup bro?

This is for the bitches that played me, waddup ho?

I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad

2 kids that don't even know their real dad

Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it

Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic

It's called Stillmatic: you be talkin' about the same shit

That's how I feel about it, mama was a real addict

That's why I don't respect that lyin'-ass white shit you talkin'

Cole's plannin' funerals, you might fit the coffin



[Hook]



[Verse 3: J. Cole]

Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday!

We in two different lanes, you can't navigate

We in wto different games, you playin' patty cake

Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier

You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute

The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it

My rides is tinted', my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it

She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it

But it's just a nigga God invented

The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it

Word, this shit ain't vibe nigga, why you noddin' with it?

The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it

Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked

And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me

Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga

Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga

I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga

You saved so many hoes, you a hero nigga!

Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac

When he slept with Madonna

Hey, this is death before dishonor

Get arrested and forget to tell my mama

She got enough to stress about

My niggas gonna get me out

Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors

No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records

Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?

Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it

But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it

The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it

When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?

Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set

It goes tick-tock, game on lock

Sun gon' shine but the rain won't stop

Oh no!"

Would you love me...

[Verse 1:]

Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'm a

Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder

Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under

And bundle up, it's gonna be a cold ass summer

You niggas so last summer

Onto the new, on onto the new shit

Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me

Two years later bitch we made it on, onto the Blueprint

Now how's that for persistence

Cole World comin', call back up assistance

Same broads, used to hang up on my walls

Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress

Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned

Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball

Put money over bitches but we still underdogs

Did you miss me?

No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?

Up, up and away, hey, do you trust me?

If I was on my last dollar, dead poor, assed out, would you love me?

Then it must be a match made in heaven

God's Gift

God's Gift

Motherfucker this is God's gift



[Verse 2:]

Pussy my passion

Man I just can't help it I see a cookie, I grab one

Lookin' for some nookie, I'm tryna scoop me a bad one

Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one

Ever since I got on

I've been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on

Ex-cheerleader hollerin' what's up

Now her nigga beat her, now that's fucked up

What type of little fuck boy hitter

Woman baby wouldn't put his hands on a nigga

I ain't bitter boy that's all you

Plus I just fucked her 'fore she called you

Dry your eyes baby, I'll drive you home

Older hoes sayin', my how you've grown

I came up, fucked the game up

Show my momma I'll survive on my own

Did you miss me?

No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?

Look, I just shed tears homie and now I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
And when I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left them I reflected on my younger days

When it was just me and my brother and my mother played

Father, cause no other man bothered

Not even my biological, it never seemed logical

But I accepted it cause I ain't know no better

Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater

No pops was like Martin with no Coretta

So many things you could have told me

And saved me the trouble of lettin' my mistakes show me

I feel like you barely know me

And that's a shame cause our last name is the same

That blood type flowin' through our veins is the same

My mama left you and maybe your anger's to blame

But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth

And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me

Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury

Maybe I should be tellin' you fuck you cause you selfish

But I want a father so bad, I can't help it



I break down, I break down

Can't help but break down

I break down



[Verse 2:]

I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit man

It's fuckin' with her body, now she sick damn

I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool

Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?

Quicksand is what this life feel like

That shit these rappers kick is nothin' like real life

You made a milli off of servin' hard white, yeah right

My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like

Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shootin' niggas

I swear to God, wish I could bullet proof my niggas

Can't get no jobs, but they still recruitin' niggas

We tryna stand tall when it gets to crucial niggas



Break down! We break down, we break down, we break down...



[Verse 3:]

Servin' time, locked down

And she don't want nobody to know, his daughter 25 pounds

By the time he get out, she gon' be 4

Now will his girl stay down?

Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho

But temptation stays round

And if she strayed, how could he ever know?

Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend

A little freakin', but them niggas holla

But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'

Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in 7 seasons

Damn! She do the best that she can

Her mama tellin' her to find another man

She college educated with a felon boyfriend

That's what she thinkin' tonight

Maybe she's right, but please



Stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!

Please... stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!

Don't break down, don't break down, don't break down, don't break down...



Break, break down

Steady break me down

Now the little nigga doing big old things

Would you look at that, I came back for her

Just to give it to her, like you asked for it

Man that thing in them jeans too fat for her

It rebounds so I caught it off the backboard

I told her, baby girl come here

Know I run the town even when I ain't from there

And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party I made

What your nigga make in one year, that's unfair but
