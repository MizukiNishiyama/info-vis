You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was I hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight

Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white

Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right



Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends

You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend

I'm not phased, only here to sin

If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can



Call me when you want, call me when you need

Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way

Call me when you want, call me when you need

Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like



Hmm, hmm

Hmm, ah, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm

Ayy, ayy



I wanna sell what you're buyin'

I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii

I want the jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'

Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'

Oh, oh, why me? A sign of the times, every time that I speak

A dime and a nine, it was mine every week

What a time, an incline god was shinin' on me

Now I can't leave

And now I'm actin' hella elite

Never walk with niggas that's in my league

I want to fuck the ones I envy, I envy



Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends

Who would've thought I'd get there anyway?

Way too hard to live

But, today I'm gonna run away from home

Can't find a love who loves me the same

Or as much as you do

Hold up, hold up, hold up

Oh, I reach out my hand

Open the door

See, I'm more than what everyone tells me

Hold up, hold up, hold up

See, I'm gettin' tired of the way I been livin'

I'd rather die than to live with these feelings

Stuck in this world where it's so much to prove

Every win gives you more room to lose

It's too many ups and downs on the ride

I'm spendin' all them dark months of time

Trapped in the lonely, loner life

Lookin' for lover on the night

Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright

Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it

Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright



I smoked myself to sleep, I'm sad, I think I'm feelin' lonely

Took one too many shots last night and I spent all my money

Started thinkin' am I stupid to be funny over things that's been hauntin' me all my life?

And I'm fuckin' living proof that if you want it, you can have anything right before your eyes



And the award goes to, Lil Nas X

Lil Nas X (Lil Nas X)

Lil Nas X (Lil Nas X)

The number one song on the Billboard Hot 100, ""Call Me By Your Name,"" by Lil Nas X



I wanted fame and I wanted riches

Wanted happiness, wanted forgiveness

Started focusin' on all these riches

Crazy how this shit come to fruition

I've done things in my past I'm sorry for, so please don't hold me

Old people in my life should know that I am not the old me (The old me)



If I say so, know they gon' ride (Gon' ride)

I know G's, and you know they ain't nice

If I pop up, I'ma want it, but I get by (Get by)

Tell the devil I can't have him inside

Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it

Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright

Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it

Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright



Woah, oh

Woah, oh

Woah, oh

Woah, oh"

And throw me up against a wall

And kick me when I have to crawl

Ooh, I love it when you show no love at all



No, I can't be your part time lover

All scars, they'll dance with each othеr

I can't be your part time lover

All scars, thеy'll dance with each other

Oh-oh-oh, never forget me, and evеrything I've done



Tears running dry, shattеred inside, but I still gotta smile

As I'm sinking, I relive the story

Glitter comes off, battered and blue, but I gotta go on

As I'm singing, I rewrite my story

I got the horses in the back

Horse tack is attached

Hat is matte black

Got the boots that's black to match

Ridin' on a horse, ha

You can whip your Porsche

I been in the valley

You ain't been up off that porch, now



Can't nobody tell me nothin'

You can't tell me nothin'

Can't nobody tell me nothin'

You can't tell me nothin'



Ridin' on a tractor

Lean all in my bladder

Cheated on my baby

You can go and ask her

My life is a movie

Bull ridin' and boobies

Cowboy hat from Gucci

Wrangler on my booty



Can't nobody tell me nothin'

You can't tell me nothin'

Can't nobody tell me nothin'

I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more



Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar

Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar

Baby's got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras

Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car

Got no stress, I've been through all that

I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back

Wish I could roll on back to that old town road

I wanna ride 'til I can't no more



Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
