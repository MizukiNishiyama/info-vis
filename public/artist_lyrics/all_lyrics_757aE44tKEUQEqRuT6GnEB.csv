We started off robbers, now we certified ballers

I be on my ball hog shit

Had to go the humble route, they thought I lost it

Never make a u-turn on me, double what it's costing

Running with some C's I know some B hats like Boston

Had to get some tough skin, you'll never make it with soft skin

Ice on my wrist

Lie to the judge, I can't lie to my bitch

Got a taste of money and I run it up ever since

Running with the congress, we know all the dead presidents

All I know is Roddy take the lead and they gone follow

All I know is if you cross you get a hollow

Climbing out the holes, but I do this shit so effortless

Hustle just to live

Spent the fifty bands on the whole squad shopping at Phipps

And they know I got them, but they better never have loose lips

All this water on me looking like a motherfucking cruise ship

Got glizzys on glizzys, never go nowhere without the hip, hey

Got ten million out the oven like a chocolate chip

Got QPs cause real P's never cop a zip

My whip a spaceship, I'm so comfortable in my cockpit

Mustard just sent the new Ferrari, I just might cop me one

They can't be Ricch, they just tryna make a carbon copy of him

Countin' up this new money, every single day I'm home

I ain't worried 'bout what they be on

You do what you can, I live a lifestyle on the daily, homes

Bracelets on my right wrist, I got eighty on, my fragrance strong

My bitch on top, we're tapin', she don't ride it with no lace on

The lean poured, the Ace gone, the double R, the gray stone

The inside blueberry and the outside is Akon

Maybach jumpin' like a jumpin' jack off the mumble rap

Where Roddy at? I be chasin' chicken, had to cut the fat

Only wear it one time, did a show, forgot to cut the tags

Another day, another seal, another deal, another bag

Was nineteen, chartin' up the jets, I'm in another class

Niggas couldn't even tell, I was out gettin' cash

Graduated from the streets, I ain't gotta bring up my past

Love's unlikely 'cause hoes pricey

Can you come around and live and breathe, trust?

Live your whole life with yo' feet up

I just love yo' energy, so, I bought another Patek Phillipe

Black Chanel shades on, I know you can barely see

Hermès garments, make sure you warmed up

Take you out to Greece and introduce you to foreigners

Treat Mercedes Benz like it's Toys""R""Us

And I just do it just because

And one thing 'bout me, know that loyalty crucial

I can drape you a nice ice, I'm the God of nightlife

Throw up twenty-three thousand and walk out like Mike

You my twin, we identical, ayy

Two steppin' on a pinnacle, ayy

Black trucks in the rearview

Can you tell I'm really into you? Ayy-ayy-ayy

Wanna take yo' pain away-way-way-way?

Right now, you ain't got a way, way, way, way

I ain't got no time to chase

Wanna store you in my mind as bae

Got your mama house on the hill, before you turned two

No, I'm not perfect, took some losses and I made mistakes

I took some time for separation, I just needed space

Gucci'd you down in every body part

Head to toe, I just had to let you know

Jesus Pieces, so you could be just like your pops

Once I start lovin' you, I promise, I ain't never stop

Wanted to be here for your whole life, but I got a heaven clock

I gave you money to keep your riches, not just stress you out

Invest your chicken in some buildings and some Swiss accounts

I had made a l— a right on Alondra, um

Walked up by the side of the airport

And I passed the hood, you know what I'm sayin', and

And I went all the way to The Cedars

I had pulled up on my DJ at the time and

He was just tellin' me keep my head up and shit like that

Shit was crazy, you know?

I felt like I wanted to die, I felt like I ain't even wanna be no more 'cause

I just— I ain't have shit at the time, you know what I'm sayin'?

And music was all I really had, so

You know just from goin' to jail and

Fucking around in the streets, I knew it wasn't shit

So I had to just, keep my head up, keep goin', get focused

Grind that shit out, you know what I'm sayin'?"

I don't ever gotta chase it

I don't ever gotta talk, came from the pavement

I was always granny's favorite

Got too many Richard Milles to ever have time for a lil' bitty bitch

Got too many plugs in the streets to ever walk around without a stick

Got too many hoes that never have a lil' shorty on top of the dick

Got too many life expenses to ever stop popping my shit

I got niggas that's on the fort yard, went four times, on this fifth time

Ever seen snake turn to a rat like 6ix9ine?

Got a Rolls-Royce with the thick back and I got a bitch, thick spine

Put a green beam on lil' Glock, best believe I'ma get mine

And the feds and the cops ain't got no heart

How they gon' take my lil' cousin upstate? He was whippin' to give all his children a start
