Bring us to this bitter plane
I know that I'm beneficial, I can't show no feelings, Bentley windows tinted
Nowadays ain't no time for me to kick it, business too intensive
They gon' say that I been actin' different, I'm beyond they mental

I moved on from slangin' drugs and pistols, can't be thinkin' simple

Tighten up my circle, someone in the camp been leakin' info

The Maybach triple black, the shit relaxin', feel like I'm in a limo

I pull through the hood to let them see, I let down all the windows

I know I'm the motivation, they see me, they see a hero

'Lot of niggas rich, but it hit different when you come from zero

They know I bang C's, but everyday I need a different B roll

Super superstitious, ask my niggas, I still pick up pennies

You can't give attention to these bitches when your name get mentioned

If I don't kill him, he gon' be in critical condition when I'm finished with him

Some shit just can't faze you when you been that nigga

Brodie died, that shit had me all sentimental

Cause got life in jail, I pray to God they overturn his sentence



I got too much money for my mom to work a job, I know she proud now

Sensei to these bitches, when they see me, they gon' bow down

I made real niggas win again, we back in style now

And I got the blicky for that rah-rah

I go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop

My new house got slidin' glass doors, don't got no doorknobs

I'm in charge, I'm always gon' go hard, you just do your part

And no matter what, know if you get up, then you lose your spot



You can say whatever, but if I change it's for the better

That shit was painful, but I ain't let up, I left a stain in the ghetto

Been inside the mix since a lil' jit, got my name from the ghetto

But I'm bigger now, I can go to dinner with Corey Gamble and Miss Jenner now

Couple hundred grand up on the 'Gram before it went in style

They'll call me like, ""Take it down"", I been the one

Bossed up, I don't gotta do it, but I'ma get her done

I man up and handle my problems when I can easily run

Easy come, easy go, sell it all, get some more

We done made it to another year, I'm swappin' out my cars again

Everything is the latest, can't complain 'cause I made it

Who am I gon' judge? I don't never hold nuts, I don't never hold grudges

Went to Miami for a concert, hit Chanel store for my baby

I spent three hundred on a Mercedes, if I keep goin, I'll be the greatest

I bust out cryin' and I wasn't sad, it's just a little feelin' you get when you make it

I done tried, tried, tried, and tried, and tried again, I can't even fake it, yeah



I got too much money for my mom to work a job, I know she proud now

Sensei to these bitches, when they see me, they gon' bow down

I made real niggas win again, we back in style now

And I got the blicky for that rah-rah

I go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop

My new house got slidin' glass doors, don't got no doorknobs

I'm in charge, I'm always gon' go hard, you just do your part

And no matter what, know if you get up, then you lose your spot



Only one of us

Who's gonna walk away?

Here in the deep below

That only darkness really knows"

Big body Benz (Skrrt)
Cut off all my friends
Choppas for my enemies
Go and ask the streets about Lil Dominique, I been a beast
Really got my name from shootin' dice and selling niggas weed

557, 223s

308s go through a car door

All the houses paid off

None of my hoes ain't got no car note

Sell a thousand, scream free Ralo

Baby, you should stop it, I know

Everything's a profit fasho

Pilot waiting on us, let's go



Still be in the projects with Coldhearted and Q Ball

Wreck the 'Rari, buy a new one tomorrow, I'm too raw

I got foreigns all colors like a pack of Starburst

When they ask me how it happened, I just tell 'em God works

I'm tryna touch me a billi, still hustle like I'm on zero

Really done saved some niggas, that's why they call me the hero

Trappin' like this shit legal, I'm tryna uplift my people

I used to serve in a Regal, I turned them into believers, yeah



I don't want yo bitch, we can't swap out (Swap out)

They ain't on shit, tell 'em to pop out (Pop out)

Mama, I got rich, look at yo drop out (Drop out)

Guns up, it ain't nothing to talk about (Guns up)



Outside in yo city lookin' good (Lookin' good)

It's a Draco, call it ""Wish a nigga would"" (It got wood on it)

And she think that she special but I'm good on her (Good on her)

Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everything I say I stood on it

Outside in yo city lookin' good (Lookin' good)

It's a Draco, call it ""Wish a nigga would"" (It got wood on it)

And she think that she special but I'm good on her (Good on her)

Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everything I say I stood on it



My life really a miracle, my bitches said I'm magical

I still fuck with Lil Critical, I ran through more than half of them

I put on for that Avenue, I had to bust my ass for this

How a bitch who never even met me gon' try to tell my business?

How someone I only had sex once with gon' try to have a kid by me?

Once you cross that line, you dead really, that's how it is with me

Brodie got rich off of Percs, he sell 'em twenty-five a piece

My lil' scammin' ass bitch made quarter million in a week

I ain't never thirsty, run into a hoe and don't even speak

Got that Blick on me in public, hope they think it's only me

This shit different, they gotta go through my assistant just to reach me

If nobody else gon' show 'em, I'll teach 'em (I'll teach 'em)



Outside in yo city lookin' good (Lookin' good)

It's a Draco, call it ""Wish a nigga would"" (It got wood on it)

And she think that she special but I'm good on her (Good on her)

Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everything I say I stood on it

Outside in yo city lookin' good (Lookin' good)

It's a Draco, call it ""Wish a nigga would"" (It got wood on it)

And she think that she special but I'm good on her (Good on her)

I'm a walking script, record me
This a .30 and a .40, switch make it hit fast as hell
Bitch told me she pray for me, told her pray for brodienem in the cell
I don't got no stylist, Marni shoes and pants, I'm fresh as hell
Yes I know what happened, I ain't no rat, so I ain't gon' never tell

You can follow Baby, won't lead you wrong, bro, I ain't gon' never fail you

Big was tryna show me the right way to go, I was so rebellious

Whatever they doin' don't bother me, bro I'm oh so careless

You the type of guy that want the ""I"" for real, you oh so selfish

I'm the type of guy ready to die for this shit if it gon' prevail us

I can't slip, look at this shit I've built, I know they tryna nail us

Give her two or three thousand off the rip, she said she want her nails done

Cuban links on just because, this shit really from the mud

We handled the business like gentlemen, I can't rock with thugs

Jeff can get ten M''s if he needed it, you know I rock with Thug

All my niggas jack in the boxes, playin', we poppin' up



Pop up with them switches on

Pop up with that shit on

Pop up like my granny, call my granny, lot of chains on

I might pop up with your bitch, later on I'll send her home

I heard he heard I hit his bitch, so he don't like to hear my songs

She said ""Wick you made me sick"", how when I'm your medicine

Ain't gay, don't go that way at all, but I love that nigga Benjamin

Chop stick, grrt-bah-bah-bah, keep that for the robber men

Foreign fabric, cars, and hoes, I'm the only thing American

I done stuffed a million in the duffle, smurf dollars blue color

Pull up big body Barbus trucks the new Hummers

Told me I lay the pipe right, I'm her new plumber

It's hard to interact with people, I come from the jungle

We some animals in designer clothes and jewelry

How we got the same cars they drove in Fast and Furious?

Why she ask me ""Do I love her? "", I said ""You can't be serious"" (Uh)

Cold-hearted, touch my chest and you gon' burr



Super fast, I'm hit the gas, you hear her skrr-rr

Twenty-two, five, lil' rico got him pure

I was standin' on the block tryna get a rack to buy a Buick

Now I'm trim, Lamborghini Boy, I know you seen that Urus

If I ever run into your bitch, your love life gon' be ruined

Take a break, but ain't gon' never gonna stop, this shit to be continued

From a traphouse, beatin' down the doors to packin' out the venue

When they catch him, they gon' eat him up, I put him on the menu

Put piranhas on yo ass, three, four hundred on your ass

Get the switch, she actin' bad, like your mama on your ass

My first deal was worth a couple mil', I still was sellin' bands

Maggot bitches trying to tackle me, I'm stiff armin' they ass

Google said my net worth five mil', I got that shit in cash

Everyday my life go up and up, it's hard for me to get mad

I'm established, I might pop out, Cactus Jack on like I'm Travis

They act happy, but as soon as you turn your back, they try to stab you

I done manifested this shit, as soon as I see it I'm gonna grab it

I act humble, but you can go and check my numbers, I ain't average

I be hearin' shit, but you old washed up niggas, I be laughin'

You don't hear nothing 'bout my young niggas, cause they know to put on a mask



Yeah, pop out with a baddie with me

Pop up with Lil' Danem with me

Pop up with that cannon on me

He can't come, we banned lil' homie"

My favorite bitch just cut me off and she won't even let me know the reason (Yeah)
It's prolly one of her lil' messy hatin'-ass friends bein' evil
I ain't stressin' 'bout it, she'll come around when she wanna eat it up
Slow stroke, fast stroke, grind in it, I'm a real pleaser

Sixty hoes in New York havin' dinner

Bottega send it to me soon as they get it

I put Maybach seats in the Sprinter

Make sure evеrybody sit comfortable

You gotta really pay attention, I’m not mumblin’

Shе tryna have a good time, she wanna come with us

They know we can't be fucked with, they not one of us

It's done been some times I slipped, I'm not fallin'

Brabus baby blue, the inside too

I'm feelin' like a kid again

They thought I got lucky last time

Fuck it, I'm back on that shit again

Her last bag was a crocodile Kelly

Got it chocolate to match her skin

I just gave bro a hunnid pounds of wham

Told him, ""Tell the city it's in""

Majority of the time I hi and bye these niggas

I ain't with all that lockin' in shit

Money over everything, try to stop it

You get popped right then and there

Message thread full of, ""Where you ats?"" and ""Pull up on me""

Bunch of ""Whens"" and ""Wheres""

Younngings out here wildin' with no guidance

All they care about is who they kill

I was tryna keep that shit in order

It got harder 'cause I was never there

It's a better life out here

I promise, brodie, I'ma keep it in they ear

I know how it feel to spin a opp

But it feel way better to count a million

I come from the bottom of the bottom

I shot right up through the fuckin' ceilin'

Yeah, stay down, hustle hard until you come up

Take some, only when you need it

You won't make it far bein' greedy

My grandma taught me how to be a leader

If we fly commercial, we got greeters

They just know that we important people

They see how we comin', think we ghetto

Until their children tell 'em I'm their hero

Flight attendant said I look familiar

Crack a smile, tell her, ""It's a small world""

Oh, that's your bitch? That's my hoe too

We gon' share her, call her, ""Our girl""

Real street music, I ran that field

If you can hit that, then she ain't my girl

Get your lick back, come step in my world

Two bitches on the same itinerary

Same flight, same hotel, they don't even know each other yet (Yeah)

One of them don't say nothin', other askin', ""Do we go together yet?""

Young turnt nigga, ain't no holdin' back

This a Brabus, bro, not a regular Wagon

I don't kiss and tell, I ain't into that

Put you in a Phantom 'cause you my lil' boo
Ready for whatever, I tie up my boots

Everybody goin' the same route, so, I switched up my route

Niggas ain't be what they talkin' 'bout, so, I switched up my crew

Actin' like you love me knowin' it's flaw, so, I'm gon' fake it too

But, that's what I'm supposed to do

Aware of my surroundings, I don't fuck with y'all, don't come around me

""Baby switched up,"" how that sound? Like a nigga in his feelings

Bookin' on my schedule, I ain't rich enough to chill out

I watched you turn sour, I don't know how to feel 'bout it

Shortly unfolded, but, I'm still solid



I'm still out here, still don't k know how to feel about it

Early in the mornin' talkin' to Marques 'bout it

Wonderin', ""Should I let it go, or, we beefin' 'bout it?""

Knowin' that I'll go cold on you for weeks about it

And it weren't that deep, but, that's just how it be with me

I can't lie, she be fuckin' me good, but, girl, you fuck me better

I see her, I get a rush

Don't go missing, stay in touch

I won't fold or bend or break, I swear I'm solid as they come

I am not lil' dude, he might be too, but he can not be one

I walk out, my hand on my gun, I gotta make it back to my sons

Dive in the end zone, I can't fumble

Invest a couple M's with my mama

I play as the glue in this shit and make sure we stick together

Brodie lost his life and it inspired me to get my shit together

You could've just brushed that off, you'd rather be dramatic

765 McLaren, this ain't the one they got

BRABUS truck, at least half a ticket, I got it in the projects

See somethin' I like, no police, I'ma cop it

Don't follow my page, I post racks every day

For these niggas and bitches that's countin' my pockets

Ooh, hurdle this bitch in Huaraches

Lambo', Ferrari, Bentleys, I got options

I took the private jet out to Nevada

4PF CED, they got smoked like a rasta

Trenches with me

Somethin' seem suspicious, somethin' seemin' fishy

I'm four pockets full and look like biscuits

Overprice us and we uppin', uppin'

Fire, fire, fire, fire, that sound sound delicious

You can't use the dishes, in the kitchen cleanin'

Woo, woo, litty, can't abort the mission, bitch, I got addictions

I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?

Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's

Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at

Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at

Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach

Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”

You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back

Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""

Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at

Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that

Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that

I gotta get rich for my kids, I'm on my second son
I done did the bid when 90% of niggas ain't coming home

Until all my hitters get out the system, they going in every song

I done ran up digits, real million off a camera phone

Now I run the charts, I'm going hard damn near on every song

Try my best to help my people out, they try to do me wrong

I don't hold grudges, I get money

I won't budge and I won't comment

Seen the way you played it, that shit raw, it made my stomach burn

Grandma told me long as I keep living, then one day I'll learn

I got in that mode, couldn't wait no longer, I had to take a turn

My grandad call me preacher man

My verses hit people like sermons

I was in the streets, but every week, I went to Sunday service

Pay my tithes and pray God watch my back and then I'm back to serving

I'ma need for you to be near as possible, if nobody's perfect

And I'ma do whatever I can do to help you, if you worth it

Came home and I ran it up, now they don't know what I'm worth

I been getting so high

I can't even lie, like I don't know why

If we catch 'em, we gon' flip 'em, this a no fly zone

Had to play the cross, 'cause I had Chrome Hearts on (Yeah, yeah)



Scared to give it all to 'em, so I guess that I'm teasin'

I don't sweat, I'm going hard for it, no one said it was easy

On a private jet in Wyoming, I was chilling with Yeezy

In a stolen car in ninth grade, we had lost Lil' Breezy

I ain't got no credit still, long as I'm getting money, I probably never will

Ain't no sense in putting myself in debt, when I keep getting these checks

I had to realize that I'm the catch, I can't be having sex with anyone

Sometimes I get side-tracked and it's easy when so many come

They never have nothing to give but always screaming, ""Give me some""

I'm tryna be rich forreal, do whatever to get it up

I done lost it all before, I had to make 'em give it up

Glad I got to switch it up, my business up

I just hit my shorty on a text like, ""Want a Bentley truck?""

And it wasn't even no occasion, tellin' lies about me on the internet, that shit be crazy

You forget that you didn't get the Range, 'cause you was actin' lazy

But you ain't tell 'em that

All the blogs be acting shady

I ain't feeling that

Never not gon' take care of my kids and never be a rat

You know what's the motto

You don't like it, you can bring it back

I don't need yo' comment, nah

At least five niggas that would kill for me

A hundred racks for my kid lawyer, it ain't my fault she don't got morals

I got rich off my life story, I left the streets in a patty wagon

I came back and got right to it

Never question my loyalty, if it's that deep, then don't do it

Seem to go my hardest when I'm going through it



Through with that, said I'm done but then I doubled back

All these Dior garments

Close my eyes and think about where I come from when I'm performing

I'm on top of every dime, I check my balance every morning

I'm relaxing with a bad one, they be asking can they join us?

And my left wrist on Crip, nigga, these bracelets sixty pointers

And the Maybachs back-to-back, on the south side, it was me and Wunna

I'm putting on for my people 'nem, say the wrong words, we deleting him

No doubt about it, they believe in him, I won't let 'em down, I promise

I really cried when Marlo died, I felt it all in my stomach

On the same shit that I been on, I ain't never switching my formula

I remember they made fun of me, can't beef with nobody under me

These lil' niggas should honor me, I'm way up on them, honestly

Four buildings in the last month, I'm boosting up my economy

Four million, that was this week, but which one of y'all wanna come for me?

I just got two hundred for a walk through, I'll still drill

High-speed chases in a Dodge Stratus, I can still peel 'em

I be tryna put on a smile for 'em but I don't really feel 'em

I just spent three-fifty on a Richard for the second time

I showed all my niggas in the trenches it's a better life

Never get too big for me to listen, I'll take your advice

I just told Durk, ""We rich forever if we play it right""

Just keep on bein' the voice, I'll be the hero

And everything I got is a profit, started with zero

I can never turn my back on my apartment, that's where I come from

And I'm just gettin' started, relax, wait 'til I warm up



I done been to jail too many times, it feel like karma

Everywhere I sleep, I keep my stick, what I need an alarm for?

Police caught me in the cut, I had to walk out with my arms up

Ain't too big to pray last minute, I put my palms up

Yeah, flood my system with these Percies

Took the bitch to eat out at Thirteen, she was squirtin'

I just cashed out on my bitch, Celine to match her Birkin

All this shit these bitches textin' me, just do it in person

Yeah, I might pop a half an Adderall, I don't like Percies

Put the phone on DND, I'm somewhere, ain't no service

I just slimed a nigga out today but it was worth it

I switch cars like bitches switch they purses

I slow down on features, I do verses if they worth it now

This shit done got deep and, let's be honest, we can't work it out

Peeped that lately you been actin' funny, wonder what it's about

This shit really in me, hope you never doubt it, on gang

And I was acidic at a time, I got mad tears

Whatever goes up must come down, ferris wheel

He ain't buy guns, but he rather buy Chanel heels



You can be the voice if you want to

You can be the hero if you want to

You can have millions if you want to

And you can do what you want to

And we be them niggas who they lookin' up to

And we be them niggas who they lookin' up

And we be them niggas who they lookin' up to

And we be them niggas who they lookin' up



Police get behind me and they betta not stop

Binary trigger on the AR non-stop

We don't never post but we be makin' Tik Toks

Why you don't be in the hood no more, that shit hot

Niggas really thinkin' they can catch up with me

That is not my bitch if she ain't rockin Richard Millies

Just 'cause you got the same kinda car we not the same kind

I just had two bestfriends try and suck me at the same time

Damn I miss them houses in the hood we used to trap 'em out

The only reason we ain't on yo ass 'cause you was tappin' out

My opps just went to jail, I paid a bros to go and pop him out

400 a show ain't none less I betta pack it out

Catch 'em out in traffic gotta ask him what them couches 'bout

Internet gangstas y'all just actin' out

They made jokes when I was broke look at who laughin' now

I'm gettin' too big for all these chains I gotta pass them down

I'm tryna turn up all the killas, I'm tryna crash them out

I ain't got no credit, I need to get some I be cashin' out

You with the bitch because she think she gettin' passed around

I know some niggas who look rich but buyin' a couple pounds

Stop all that huffin' and that puffin' before we blow you down

I got six pipes on this G Wagon this bitch Supa loud

Turks and Caicos scuba divin' vacation 300 thousand

I'm the headliner now, I might jump off in the crowd



You can be the voice if you want to

You can be the hero if you want to

You can have millions if you want to

And you can do what you want to

And we be them niggas who they lookin' up to

Teacher bitching at me like her husband can't be fucking right

Wild niggas slide around in Tracks and SRTs

No fist fight for first degree murder, that's just what we faught

Gotti told us neva forget your dog and that's law

I got blamed for niggas dying, I wonder why

See the boss can't break me down, see I'm The Voice I don't reply

Ain't taking lean, switch his beans, shit my kit together

Some of this shit be temporary but loyalty, this shit forever

Everytime your dog die they forget about his momma and them

I done left his ass around some cash and he ain't pocket shit

Ain't the type to try to spread a rumor, I go off documents

I don't take threats like he died off a argument



Yea

Okay he did, but he died with 'em

How you say your ass a boss but you don't provide niggas

And I really love my brothers even though I clash with them

Gambling with a 100 grand and started with 2 bands

I'm one o the one that sell a truckload with a few plays

I'm one of the ones that wear the same clothes for a few days

But I'm grinding

OTF from 4TF you know this shit get slimy

I won't get on one knee I'll pay one mill for a diamond, though

You know where to find me I ain't hiding hoe

Wanna do shows and make me some songs

Make sure that other shit come in, get sold

We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles

We play with our money and not with our nose

I used to go to the West to get loads

I just came back from the West with a trophy

I'm on some more shit

She said she miss it and sendin' emojis

No time to kick it, I'm always in motion

Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions

I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit

I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit

I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit

Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit

I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it

I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend

I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz

I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in

I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?

I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws

I can see me taking the lead over the new school

They remember me from selling weed at my old school

Only hit it once and now it's old news

Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue

If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move

I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that love to the people

Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people

I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming

I'm gon' get everything I need, I'll do whatever it take

I caught a case, ran, got away, I should've jumped in the lake

I thought about it the other day when I slid through in the Wraith



Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game

Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain

Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name

Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain

Bad bitch, we both young

They say that I'm cheatin' and we both dumb

But Baby got her wrist hittin', both arms

G-Wagen and Range Rover, both of 'em

If we love forever, you get new homes

I just wish that other **** could move on

She proud to be rockin' that new two-tone

My life goin' good, why would I do wrong?

I'm livin' my best just like Lil Duval

I didn't get the message, and it's screw y'all

I don't want no issues, can't be beefin' with my family

I don't want no problems, just make sure my kids can count and read

And it ain't no pressure 'bout the money, I won't even see it

It's bigger, it's the principle, I hope one day that you can see

We got a whole seed to raise, it's bigger than you and me

How I'm not gon' do that? I spend millions on my jewelry

The only reason I'm mentionin' it is 'cause I'm tired of this foolery

I'm just emptying my thought, I can't keep 'em in a box

Ain't no hard feelings at all, I want everyone to ball



Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game

Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain

Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name

Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain

I bought a pendant, came from Watson, but I ain't proposed

Ridin' with an AR, but he got murked with a revolver

I sent the crackhead in the pharmacy for cough syrup

No, she can't play me, but if she try, I'ma dog her

They been askin' questions crazy, ""Is you 'bout to drop a tape yet?""

""Is you tryna go independent? Rylo did you sign with Baby?""

Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested

Officers arrested

(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)



Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve

I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please

I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze

Fucked up, I seen what I seen

I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe

It's too many mothers that's grieving

They killing us for no reason

Been going on for too long to get even

Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas

I went to court and they sent me to prison

My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave

First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick

When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb

He got a life sentence plus

We just some products of our environment

How the fuck they gon' blame us?

You can't fight fire with fire

I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some

Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist

I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces

Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive

Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside

Stare in the mirror whenever you drive

Overprotective, go crazy for mine

You gotta pay attention to the signs

Seem like the blind following the blind

Thinking 'bout everything that's going on

I boost security up at my home

I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong

I call him now, he'll pick up the phone

And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it

Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'

I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'

That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us

Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us

While they go home at night, that shit messed up

Knowing we needed help, they neglect us

Wondering who gon' make them respect us

I can see in your eye that you fed up

Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up

They know that we a problem together

They know that we can storm any weather



It's bigger than black and white

It's a problem with the whole way of life

It can't change overnight

But we gotta start somewhere

Might as well gon' 'head start here

We done had a hell of a year

I'ma make it count while I'm here

God is the only man I fear



Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line

He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line

You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine

You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time

I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters

I want all my daughters to show out in public

Seems like we losing our country

But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to

Every video I see on my conscience

I got power, now I gotta say somethin'

Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from

But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them

I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them

Altercations with the law, had a lot of them

People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them

Stick together, we can get it up out of them

I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote

I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go

This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change

Got time to be serious, no time for no games

We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains

God bless they souls, every one of them names



It's bigger than black and white

It's a problem with the whole way of life

It can't change overnight

But we gotta start somewhere

Might as well gon' 'head start here

We done had a hell of a year

I'ma make it count while I'm here

God is the only man I fear



They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets

They regular people, I know that they feel it

These scars too deep to heal us

What happened to COVID? Nobody remember

It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent

It happen to one of your people, it's different

We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it

Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted

I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me

Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention

It's people who can, well, here's the chance

I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe

Must not be breathing the air that I breathe

You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed

I never been a fan of police

But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace

So it's only right that I get in the streets

March for a reason, not just on GP

Our people died for us to be free

Fuck do you mean? This was a dream

Now we got the power that we need to have

They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah



It's bigger than black and white

It's a problem with the whole way of life

It can't change overnight

But we gotta start somewhere

Might as well gon' 'head start here

We done had a hell of a year

I'ma make it count while I'm here

Took a trip to overseas, I'm buyin' drip in other currencies

I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit

Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred occasion

Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down

They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now

See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down

The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me

The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis

The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking

Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping

My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active

I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend

I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz

I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in

I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?

I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws

I can see me taking the lead over the new school

They remember me from selling weed at my old school

Only hit it once and now it's old news

Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue

If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move

I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that love to the people

Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people

I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming

Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy

She throw a hoodie on soon as we land

She don't like pics, I got too many fans

I'm runnin' shit, I can do what I want

And it's really a limit, you do what you can

I found the booth and I put that shit up

'Fore I run out of cash, they gonna run out of land

I fell in love with this bitch 'cause her head was amazing

I swear I don't even know her name

I'm 'bout to takeoff, I gave 'em a chance

They gave me ten M&M's on advance

Thought I'd be trappin' forever, but God came and blessed me

I guess it was part of the plan

How he on fire, but he cool as a fan?

Can't get at you, we gon' get at your man

They can relate to me 'cause I be poppin' it

They say the drop hot and it's ready

Might stretch it out, but it ain't fetti (Yes)

Say my dawg doin' time

But I know he ain't gonna snitch 'cause it's still some shit he didn't tell me

My dawg stabbed his celly

Sell my drugs 'round the corner

I pay all these bills, I'm a grownup

My cars a lil' different, I own 'em

I ain't with no leasin', my bitch tellin' me I need credit

Got a bank account with Chase

Half a million in my safe

Swear I'm on my way

Screamin' free Kevin Gates

I go and get it by any means

Rockin' red bottoms with Amiri jeans

Pop a percocet, take a sip of lean

I bought real diamonds for the whole team

I been gettin' money since thirteen

I been grinding hard, stayin' lowkey

Sellin' whole bags of the OG

Get you knocked off for a low fee

Diamonds hittin' hard, no lights needed

Run it up fast like light speed

Runnin' up the cost in a white tee

I don't go on dates, we fuckin' right now

Make 'em treat me like a king, I got 'em bowing down



They say talk is cheap, I let my diamonds talk

2018, it came with auto-park

Sixty-seven thousand on an Audemars

Never leave my niggas, I love all of y'all

Takin' all these drugs like I'm a rockstar

Hi-Tech and that Act, I don't drink Wockhardt

I didn't have a car, I used to walk far

Now I'm standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar



Rockstar status me

My last bitch abandoned me

We could've had a family

That shit made a man of me

I got niggas mad at me

Niggas I ain't never seen

I don't drink green lean

I fell in love with codeine

Jumpin' on the stage, look at the crowd, I got 'em goin' wild

Only rock the latest, they all on me, checkin' out my style

Chain gang, sittin' in the cell I had my first child

Mama tried to keep me in the house but I was runnin' wild

Sellin' nicks and dimes to the fiends at the West End Mall

Come through in a brand new Hellcat, I had 'em hatin' hard

You ain't got no haters you ain't poppin', keep 'em on they job

Came up in the trenches with them hustlers, I ain't have no job



They say talk is cheap, I let my diamonds talk

2018, it came with auto-park

Sixty-seven thousand on an Audemars

Never leave my niggas , I love all of y'all

Takin' all these drugs like I'm a rockstar

Hi-Tech and that Act, I don't drink Wockhardt

I didn't have a car, I used to walk far

Now I'm standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar



Standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar

Standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar

Standing on the stage like I'm a rockstar

I don't go on dates, we fuckin' right now

Bitch never forget that I'm a trap star

I come from the 'partments it was bad
Ramen noodles, cup of water all we had
It's like you gon' eat or you gon' starve
Either you gon' hustle or you rob

Never had no hoop dreams, but I always wanted to ball

Ever since a jit I knew I was gon' be rich

Never though it'd be like this

But now I got the money, so every day we lit



By the time I turned 10 I was running wild

Listening to Juvenile

Staying at my grandma house

My mama got put out

I've been through some shit that you would never know

But I keep a smile, I can't let it show

I was 15 Jock and Dee, caught a murder case

Runnin' with the robbers, man I know we upped the murder rates

I was sittin' in jail when Lil' Man got shot in his face

Damn that shit bad, they say that's my neice dad

Brian got killed

That shit crazy

You can't listen once you here

They tried to say we made the hit, but lookahere

But now I got the money, so every day we lit



25 cent froze cups in the hood

Me and Tyrone playing nick-a-knock in the bricks up no good

Had a walkie talkie watching for the 12 tryna make a sale

Lil' Joe ain't even kill nobody, but he got life in jail

Perkys get you by

Them youngins knock 'em down

[?] to my phone when you got back in town

They see me on the stage now, though I ain't get a cap and gown

Want me to hit it raw dawg

200 for that pussy, gee baby don't you play hard ball

Lil' Pooh them bring them rods out

Ice on me, can't thaw it out

Fuck this drink might pour it out

Chain look like I'm showing out

Xans, but I ain't goin' out

Sales coming in and out

We just tryna sew the block

Grandma found my stash box and she tried to throw me out



I come from the 'partments it was bad

Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall

Find a new plug then we takin' em all

Pull up in a brand new Benz Truck

Hop out fresher than a mento

Lil nigga but I'm big dawg

All I gotta make is one call

Get a nigga block took off

Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce

Ooh I got 'em mad, my fault

Talking bout the shit that I bought

Poppin' these percs I done turned to a savage

Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress

Hundred racks stuffed in the attic

Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa

These niggas play gangsta but they won't approach me

I know they'll never approach me

They know that they'll catch a bullet

I rock the game to the fullest

I run with some real ones I don't hang with no pussies

I ain't no killer don't push me

I see how you niggas be lookin'

I hope you don't think you no bully

I'm livin' the life I should star in a movie

Ridin' in a vert with a uzi

Twelve get behind me I lose 'em

They tryin' guess what I'm doin'

They tryin' guess who I'm screwin'

That ain't even they business

They ain't wanna fuck with me

Now they see a nigga drippin'

Now they wanna fuck with me

They can't get in touch with me

Hardly ever in the city

They just know a nigga busy

Everytime a nigga winnin' they holdin'

They don't wanna see me up, they just wanna see me stuck

Guess that shit there just wasn't enough

Funny how these niggas switchin' up

I thought you was suppose to be my fam, damn

No and I wasn't surprised but it's straight now I just see you can't be one of them guys

All I see is dollar signs when I close my eyes

Every nigga claim they real but they just livin' a lie



They don't wanna see me win, they wanna see me bend

They don't want me in that Benz they want me walkin'

Gave them niggas my all when I ain't have too

I swear I gotta take off nigga I'm past due

Lately I been really feelin' like I really deserve this

All the shit we been through I just hope it was worth it

4'd up sticks we don't come out at play time

Only time I get to see my son is on FaceTime

I been goin' through some shit lately

Wonderin' why these pussy niggas hate me

I'm the same nigga from the block that tried to save 'em

We been runnin' since a jit man I damn near raised 'em

Thinkin' should we go and get them sticks and erase 'em

Watch my manz fold in the gym like some paper

I'm just tryna chase my dreams, get my weight up

We was broke we couldn't sleep we just stayed up

Runnin' from them laws on a daily basis

I just pray to God when I wake up Ion't catch no cases

We got dirty K's on the block

They don't want a nigga to pop

They ain't never gon' stop

I'ma keep gettin' this paper

Ain't gon' wait upp

I love her but I won't save her

I be damned if I chase her"

We gon' go get it regardless



Shit, now I been gettin' this paper for a minute now

I'm tryna put gangsters in the position now

And I been kickin' flavor so consistent

I know that Lil Baby and Marlo with me, don't start Lil Trippy

Gotta keep that burner on me

I tried to turn some niggas up, they end up turnin' on me

And I don't need a bitch around me she don't serve a purpose

Them niggas fuckin' with you but I heard you're workin'

Woo, you're walkin' dead

I turned myself into a boss instead

My biggest struggle is tryna fit a quarter mill in my barber bag

Might hit your bitch and don't call her back, huh

I been workin' like I want all the cash



I been workin' hard, I been grindin'

Fuckin' up my profit on these diamonds

My new watch say perfect timing

I had to found it and I found it

I just upgraded my bitch, bought her designer

In the hood you tryna find us

Me and my niggas we be ballin'

We gon' go get it regardless"

They can't get to me because I'm up

Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot

We been on the jets, we fly private

I just touched down in LA today, in New York tomorrow

Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow

Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar

Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems



I'm tryna stack up and get it

I went from rags to riches

I blow the bag in Lenox

I heard your Jag was rented

I know you mad, admit it

Jump in that Lam and hit it

She tried to take me to Maury, no bitch I'm not the father

All of these bitches they know that we get it

Takin' them private flights city to city

The shit that they doin', we already did it

Never been losin', we already winning

Coupe fully loaded, it's already tinted

[?] off the lot, leave the top with the dealer

I'm not a rapper, bitch I am a dealer

They can't get to me 'cause I'm in the middle

We ain't got no money problems, we ain't got no money problems

I told 'em put me in the game coach, I'm a starter

And if she actin' like she need me I'ma starve her

Remember days ridin' on MARTA

But now we flyin' private jets to different cities

And I keep a bad bitch with me

Two chains everywhere like Tity, I done growed up

Bad bitches askin' where the weed, it's time to roll up



They can't get to me because I'm up right now
