Just talkin' 'bout what I see
It's not opinion based, it's just, just shit I see (Uh)
The suburbs are filled with ebonics and trap sonics
Frat boys saying ""no cap"" ""put racks on it""

The dialect got a lil splash of some black on it

Cap and gowns bought by the money in Dad's pockets

White girls squattin', tryn get that a- poppin

Caught back talking to their Mom and Dad's often

Reciting rap lyrics about murder and cash profit

Get to feel like a thug but don't have to act on it

Local homicide rates got em astonished

Reading bout it on a laptop in pajamas

Microsoft office to complete their assignments

Never seen the hood still can't help but have comments

Never had a convo with a kid from that climate

That really has trauma, that really got taught to survive by any means fuck bitches, stack commas

Common ground ain't that common

The festivals are filled with Larry Bird jerseys

College students in a hurry to jump to a 4 count

And say the n word

Business interns taking molly then percs

Trampling on top of bodies in dirt

Condescending suburban kids growing up to be rap journalists

Writing urban myths about who they think is the best urban kid

And who the worst is

And whos authentic

And what the real hip hop is and who's all in it

Thrift shopping for articles and garments that feel like they came from a foreign environment

Second hand Bape Supreme and

Gallery department

Anything to feel less harmless

Adderall dealers, carrying round guns just to make it feel realer

House with white pillars

No rough just diamonds, The education private

It's all by design and

Common ground ain't that common"

I'm tryna get rough
Fuck buffin' my nails, dawg, I'm tryna get buff
Fuck shaping my beard up, I'm liking the scruff

And fuck the hills 'cause I'm living my life in the cut

Can't imagine that I'm gon' meet my wife in the club

We gon' see tho'

I feel like she more of a CEO

Or maybe she doing volunteer work in Rio

It's not like Anitta, but I would love to meet her

Another day, another dollar, another phone with another feature

I don't play goalie but I'm my brother's keeper

Surrounded by family I'm not with other people

They say I got my pops demeanor and mother's features

The garden still private as ever

The gang thriving together

Ya boy striving to be

The most dominant ever

The hardest white boy since the one who rapped about vomit and sweaters

And hold the comments

'Cause I promise you I'm honestly better

Than whoever came to ya head right then

They ain't cut from the same thread like him

They don't study doin' work to get ahead like him

They don't toss and turn in the fuckin' bed like him

Fuck searching my name, dawg, that's how you get hurt

Fuck being likeable I'm tryna be unbreakable

I just realized that this whole game is takeable

If I want it

And I do, yes, I want it

I don't care how you feel about it, I do what I wanna

I used to look up to the people that I'm moving in front of

It's not that crazy anymore, my city used to a come up

Bryson, Jack, Gee

James is up next

The rest is up to me

These lames is upset

My peers get upstaged

The fans are obsessed

My city is upcoming

It's people are oppressed

And I'm gon' change things

I'm up at Carmichael's tryna get on the same page

I heard about the rapper that you claimed was a mainstay

They had a nice run but they never gon' maintain because

Peach fuzz comin' in
Cool kid, but my haircut like I'm a weirdo
Peyton Siva, Montrezl Harrell

Scuffed-up kicks, Old Navy my apparel

And I'm cummin' in my girl like I'm sterile

Totaled my whip, I thought I had the green arrow

I was never meant to be a college applicant

Fuck I look like goin' to college after this

Class clown type that like to holla at the chicks

Friend group solid as it gets

Recordin' in my room with the air conditioner all up in the mix

Did a couple local shows, okay, my following exists

Even if it's fifteen high school chicks

Better than a front row of dicks

Onе day I'm gon' be front row at the Knicks

Wait until the world gеts a load of this (Ooh)



Ambitious nineteen year old

I just signed a deal now my neck sub-zero

Mustache coming in, I really want a beard though

And I really think this might be my year though

Suddenly, I've made some Moncler, my apparel

Playin' dive bars and stoppin' at Cracker Barrel

No security, my brothers gon' step, Will Ferrell

Gettin' high, gettin' drunk, no more straight and narrow for me

Street raps make me ask if this the era for me

Is the playing field fair or is it fairer for me? Whew

A couple karats in my ears enough karats for me

I'm feelin' like the local scene finally cherishing me

Selling out my hometown so my parents can see

Charismatic, naive, young, arrogant teen

Givin' everything I got to the American Dream

But I'm still playing 1 PM sets at the festivals

Looking at the crowd, they embarrassed for me, jeez



Ambitious twenty-four year old

Used to have dreams of being friends with my heroes

Now I'm Andrea Pirlo out in Europe spending euros

French girl chewin' on my earlobe

Here goes nothing, coasting through customs

Take away the phones at afterparties, we don't trust 'em

Heartthrob status, I've adjusting to the lustin'

Facetime calls about God from Justin

I can't stop hustlin', I can't stop hustlin'

I'm tryna be inspired, but y'all ain't got nothin'

They tryna downplay me now, ain't that somethin'?

I saw that comin'

Readin' way too many articles about myself, I gotta fall back from it

Audition for a lead and got the call back from it

I'm festival headlinin', keepin' them heads noddin'

I tell her I'll be back but I don't know when the next time is

Folks think it's 'bout to be more actin' and less rhymin'

But hell nah, I gotta show these boys who the best out is"

Years of camaraderie suddenly disappear

Almost like you never were here

Unconditional love becomes very conditioned when push comes to shove

And all that talk of takin' bullets suddenly feels foolish

Pictures with him turn to ad campaigns, you gotta pull it

Feet held to the fire

We hold accountable the ones we hold dear out of morals, but mainly fear

The choice becomes clear

And years of camaraderie suddenly disappear

'Cause it was fun when we were known less

Sorry, that's cliche, I know I'm so blessed

But Jason keeps on tellin' me, ""Say yes""

And truth be told, I know he knows best

I'm hidin' any sign of weakness from my guys

Avoidin' any talks about the elephant

Chalkin' up the hate to jealousy and just embellishments

If the people that write about are right about me

And I wonder if my exes are oversharin' 'cause they know a lot about me

I been through some local tension, heard talks of a healthy bounty

Sober and focused, I cannot walk down no deli alleys

Throwing football in the yard 'til the lights turned on inside the lampposts

Years go by

Somethin' changed when you got to junior high

Started hanging with them guys

Suddenly I meant nothin' to you, you wanted nothin' to do with me

You run with a crew that doesn't include any room for your littlе brother

I was destroyed, but I still lovеd you

I still wanted your approval, if I could get it, I'd cherish it

Embarrassing me any chance you got, but I didn't care

Because maybe if I was tough enough and take it, you would love me

Instead of lookin' at me like I'm disgusting

Like I'm nothing, like I'm not the person that you grew up with

I wanna reminisce and ask you if you miss those days, but I'm terrified of broaching the subject

I'm terrified to hear your answer, so I just don't touch it

Insult after insult, hoping they'd eat at you

Made you feel the weight of every single mistake that you made

My hot temper turned up full throttle

'Cause I needed you to be your little brother's role model

Everything that you do, he just gon' follow

Don't you understand?

It's okay, I understand

'Cause the way I parent you is how my mother did

And the way you treat your little brother's how my older brother did

When that's actually all I need?

What if they stop swearing by me?

What if they stop riding for me how they used to do before I was in front of everybody?

What if they went and found some new kid that got an air about him?

Prolly never thought that I would get these legs to work

I work hard, but hard shit don't need no extra work

I'm guessin' when the whole world loves you, people only got one way to stand out

All that time in the kitchen finally panned out

I put some flavor in a pot and took the bland out

I know my grandpa would have a heart attack if I pulled a hunnid grand out

So I'm not gonna pull a hunnid grand out

I'm hip-hop, do you fully understand?

Fully automatic with the jams and they don't jam

At the shows I'm 'bout to start handin' out programs

'Cause y'all need to get with the program

I'm a grown ass man, call me pops

Ain't too many cons when you playin' with the pros

'Cept for how your life get exposed, but I make that sacrifice for the life that I chose

I know in Toronto they got soft for the rose, but school's closed in Kentucky, so I like when it snowed

The kids carry chopsticks not for rice in the bowl

School counselors all know how they life is at home

Cold like the Minnesota Vikings at home

Before I met Drizzy I knew he and I would get along

But it's really hard to crack jokes when you really want advice

I mean what's it like to touch gold every time you touch a mic, touchin' heights, no one gets a touch in life

Fuckin' right, young bachelor, what's a wife?

Once in a lifetime, 'til I say I want it twice

One of a kind, know your everything is one of mine

Wanted posters with my face, they know who I'm wanted by



Yeah

Yeah



Cold hearts and heated floors, no parental guidance I just see divorce

Therapy sessions, I'm in the waiting room, readin' Forbes

Abandonment issues I'm gettin' treated for

How much water can I fit under the bridge before it overflows?

My son's gotta learn that forgiveness is a lonely road

The cribs on his wheel like motor homes

I'm out here makin' a mockery

I got my realtor out here playin' Monopoly

How can I address you when you don't own property?

They only finesse you when you don't move properly

Destined for the win, but you don't get a prize out of me

I'm destined for the top, but you can't get a rise out of me

Seven-fifty for the round, canaries, and they glitterin'

Man, you niggas drop trash, you littering

I'm overdelivering to the point, it's belittling

I mean, the PTSD is triggering, the profit is sickening

The stones is shimmering, came from the north

But I got hot as fuck, so ain't no shivering, yeah

Lucky me, people that don't fuck with me

Are linkin' up with people that don't fuck with me to fuck with me

This shit is getting ugly

And every situation is transactional

And every thing they sayin' is irrational

And every way they movin' is promotional

Everybody's actin' irreplacable, it's like they ain't disposable

My urges for revenge are uncontrollable

I know we're gettin' older though, yeah

But I gotta get a nigga back for that

It's non-negotiable, it's not even debatable

I'm gettin' so rich, my music's not even relatable

I blow ahead up, it's an inflatable

Baby blue G class, I feel like a kid again

Prayin' on my downfall don't make you religious, man

All I hear is plug talk comin' from middleman

All I hear is tall tales comin' from little men

When I say ""Bitch"", I'm very rarely referring to women

Most of the bitches I know are niggas, they not even women

I know that sounds like I'm being funny, I'm not even kidding

Same ones that say they run the game when they not even in it

To be honest, y'all financial situations my biggest motivation

And how you should take that statement is based on what you makin'

Whips and chains like a dominatrix, wap, pssh

If I see ya', I spit in ya' faces, ha-tu

Daytonas with the green faces

Kentucky derby races, my presence in the spot is so abrasive

Boxxed up the Churchill downs, that's motivation, yeah

And shorty like, ""You know that boy Jack is goin' places""



I know

Paranoid, even though I'm in paradise
Terrified to see my parents pass
Red carpet and some dress shoes
And a pair of slacks

I think I might be gettin' sick of wearin' that

I need some peace and the 'burbs might be where it's at

You know like where them Karens like to they run they errands at

I'm on a journey, man, Jerry Jack

Got my twin with me like The Parent Trap, there and back

Serenade 'em with the clarinet

I got the tea and I ain't sharin' that

Who the fairest of 'em all? Shawty's been declarin' Jack

Fellas hatin', I don't blame 'em, I mean how unfair is that?

Maybe this'll show where my heads at, my bad (You know)



Every sky can't be blue

It's hard to see when you're walkin' in the grey

So many flights, look at how the time flew

So many things that I never got to-

Good days, bad days, red lights, fast lanes

Would you never change? Would you be the same?

Just tell me one thing that's true when I ain't up

You hold me down



You hold me down (Hold me-)

Say you'll hold me down

Hold me down

Hold me down



You know the squares hate the prom king

You know they prayin' that I say the wrong thing

Look at the disdain that these hit songs bring, huh

I mean I could've kept it niche

But I rather my brothers get rich

Hit the kill switch, hit the slugger field first pitch

Seven-figure brand deals tend to feel worthless

I like my bed made, soon enough, I'll have a maid

When I buy a house, every surface gon' be suede

But for now, I got a concierge downstairs

All my neighbors are gray-haired

They don't recognize me and I don't think they care

But my Postmates can't believe that I stay here (Fuck)

I wanna go back to Kentucky and shut down the state fair

Visit my old teachers and tell 'em to take care

I might take a whip instead of payin' the plane fare

Baby, I'm comin' home, I know the kids miss me

I need some time with my friends to sip whiskey

I spent the last twelve months locked in

But tonight, I'm content with existing

2015, we was on that Pen Griffey

I wanted what he had, but the shoes didn't fit me

Now the city with me and I got the kids listening

And I'm a smooth operator by instinct

Word to Sade, walkin' 'round broad day

Like hey, with the windows down, I'm on Broadway

And it was just a day ago, I was in Daygo like the damn Padres

Now I'm at my grandparents' lettin' my grandpa say

What he wants to say

'Cause nowadays, I'm in the paper once a day

And it ain't always positive, it's a bunch of things

But fuck it, man, I done graduated from younger days

And if I ain't runnin' things, soon, I'll be runnin' things

I'm an artist, man, you just make fun of things

I'm the hardest, man, y'all don't know what to say

This album's a museum, so please don't touch a thing

It's okay to give me props, don't make it such a pain

It's okay to give me top, don't make it such a thing

Don't get offended if we met and I say, ""What's your name?""

I been flyin' 'round the country for three hundred days

But I ain't 'bout to justify how I adjust to fame

Fuck the fame, from the jump, we ain't been cut the same

I got so much, but I still think about what's unobtained

Never been the type for wantin' things

I want power (I want power)

I want my life to speed up a couple miles per hour

I want my dogs to know that this shit is ours

I want respect, I don't want flowers

I know they gon' quote this

The flow don't make no sense, the pocket is potent

It used to be potential, but now it's some grown shit

Damn, that boy floatin', he treat them beats like they oceans

All these people wanna greet like we old friends

I ain't holdin' back, tell the media, ""Hold this""

I know I said I miss you, but I secretly don't miss

I got stories and I'm bringin' 'em home with me

I became a millionaire at twenty two
Telling girls I love 'em and they love me too
I don't question if they mean it 'cause I know they do

Middle school bumping Waka Flocka, ""O Let's Do It""

First album and I know just how it's gon' debut

Track three is where I tell her we gon' rendezvous

I'm signed to the gatekeepers

Don't believe the gossip 'cause it ain't true

Half of the dreams I had already came true

And they never told me anything I couldn't do

I got a mirror in my room I like to look into

At seventeen, I never thought that I would look this cute

Classmates can't believe the place I took it to

If I didn't rap then I would be a good masseuse

Fun fact, but it's a hidden talent, 'cause she rubbing my back

All these different cities, I'm becoming sidetracked

She leaving my hotel wearing something I packed

My wardrobe's spread across the whole map

JWise used to book me for the open mics

Kills me when they act like this was overnight

Like we didn't do a tour in a tiny van

Eight deep at the show, it might be eight fans

That builds character, something y'all could probably use more of

If I told the truth to her, I know she'd be tore up

They love it when I rap and I don't even put a chorus

Turkey on ciabatta from the deli, shout to Morris

Thirty grand to show up, we might as well pour up

Fake handshakes, we know you ain't going for us

It's something 'bout your aura

Everything that I bet I'd be
All the kids that I grew up with
They see me out and congratulate me
Couple of 'em just graduated
Couple of 'em done had a baby

But all of 'em look at my life and say, ""That's amazing""

I say thank you like twenty times

Try to talk about somethin' else

Reminisce on some funny time

Truthfully, I'm not comfortable with gettin' all the praise

Even more when y'all get to drinkin' and start tellin' me all the things

That you really think

Likе what I should've done differеntly

What you think of my energy

The downsides that come with being friends with me

I can tell you think this the realest that anybody's ever been with me

But luckily I got PG

And luckily I keep them with me



I keep it humble so you can have a good time

I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine

And I sleep at night just fine

I tried to be kind

Now I'm speakin' my mind



(Time, ah-ah)

I like how you got the vocals (In my time, ah-ah)

Just make 'em like a little less harsh

That's the only thing

But it's in that good world (In my time, ah-ah)

(In my time, ah-ah)

Right here? Look

(La música de Harry Fraud)



Once people lose touch with ya

They start to hate ya

Start to show you they true nature

Start to be the ones in the comments

That's talkin' 'bout you like you a stranger

Talkin' 'bout ya like y'all didn't have class together

Talkin' like you not humble now or you acting better

Speakin' on the things you've done that they haven't ever

I play the game, you watch the game like Adam Schefter

I created this added pressure

I'm the one that made Jack get better

Tone it down? I could never, ooh

All the greats caught all the hate

All the rappers I love most at one point got called a fake

Everybody seem to know the song that I oughta make

Know the route that I oughta take

I put too much work in to just call it fate



But I keep it humble so you can have a good time

I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine

And I sleep at night just fine

I tried to be kind

Now I'm speakin' my mind



(Time, ah-ah)

I told your brother this, so I'ma tell you this

This is probably advice I keep giving you frequently

And probably will continue to give it to you frequently because

It's made a difference in my life

Take some moments today during the shoot to look around

Look at the faces of all the people you've brought together

Watch their reactions

Look at the joy on their faces

Take a moment to really absorb what you've created

What you're creating

And try to savor it

I know that you and I are built the same and that it's never enough

There's always some other thing we want to accomplish, but

Just lean back for a moment today

And really comprehend the greatness that you've made

Love you, babe"

Slide through the opp blocks shooting out blow darts

I been rich before I signed

Shirt cost five, wear it one time

She don't slurp, get out my ride

Run my city, you can ask my opps

Love my thots with mouths like mops

Shirt off, chains on in a drop

I spent twenty G's for a clock

Put a Bentley GT in my mouth

You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings

Extreme like DMX sing

These boys pussy and their PMSing

People in the city see the movement occurring

And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene""

Damn right, you wanna be in this scene

She had the video tryna be in this scene

Used to fantasize 'bout bein' in this scene

Blue grass girl but she got big dreams

Can't touch me, I got instincts

Locked in the house but I'm plottin' things

I brought a gang to the party with me

Five white boys but they not NSYNC

Fuck what y'all think

Fuck everything that you say about me

My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K

But one thing they don't do is play about me

My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach

He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper

I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper

I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert

Now they on my bumper

Green room chock full of all my comforts

Hotel room like Heaven on Earth

Got angels in my bed with some all white covers

H-Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Queso, Slupe, Clay, Two-four

And I got a few more, I call my brothers

I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh

You know what that means

I came home nice but I'm goin' back mean

I'm 'bout to glow with trap when they know a vaccine

Muhfuckers act lost but they know exactly what's goin' on

Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on

I tell the critic, ""Shut up"" like my show is on

Givin' T-shirts to a set, throw it on

She want a mini high school, classmates, I'm growin' on

My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong

Y'all well dressed but you ain't got soul and you just can sow it on

I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys

I tried it back then it was ""Hell nah, boy""

My dad built houses, my mom painted pictures
They both gave it up once I came into the picture
Me, I'm like them, just a fifty-fifty mixture
My mom rode horses, she wish I had a sister

I prefer the pen to a hammer or a brush

But I build things up and my imagery is lush

I used to play soccer but I never had to touch

Basketball, too, but I ain't love it that much

Much of my time's spent lookin' for a rush

Tryna find something to afford me that feeling

I fall in love with girls 'cause they physically appealing

A couple weeks pass and the convos hit a ceiling

I've smoked a fеw blunts, cookies, and runtz

Gotten high enough to know it isn't what I want

Mеt the celebrities, seen through the fronts

Dated one girl and I've seen two at once

I ain't upset to be inside for some months

And get back in touch with the person that I was

Know I've given too much of my time to the chase

Tryna get in touch with a person that I lust

So this the perfect time to hang it up

Used to sleep until noon now at nine, I'm waking up

More time that I'm inside then the less I want to talk

I don't wanna FaceTime, I ain't tryna say, ""What's up?""

Careful with the ways that my time is taken up

Bunch of geeks tryna take the shine away from us

Reaching for critiques and they tryna say I suck

Got me reminiscin' back to a time I gave a—

But my skin's gotten thick since then

And my high school crush has done the same thing

So when this blows over and I'm back home

I'ma tell her that I'm really done playin' games

Seven figures in my bank statements

Seven fellas that I'm that stayin' on the same page with

We been shootin' for the stars and our aim's dangerous

Hasn't been a single thing that the gang can't get

My main thing shall remain nameless

Know they ask about her often but I ain't sayin' shit

There's a level of discretion that I'm maintaining

She don't understand it but she ain't famous

We gon' see who's still around once the game changes

She's a business woman but I got her playing favorites

You ain't rooting for me then I gotta make changes

Ex girls watchin' with a lot of fake pages (A lot of fake pages)

My OG showed me what a Plain Jane is

And a bust down is, now I got a hankering to spend a few thousand

KY used to take me up to Icebox when he'd get his jewelry cleaned

They would ask if they could help me and I say ""I'm just browsing""

Woyne worked at Enterprise Rentals discounted

Ville to the A and back, we was putting miles in

Always wondered to myself if I could really be a leader of a group of brown-skinned boys when I'm not brown-skinned

Certain things they grew up on that they get but I don't get

Differences in how we raised make me feel like I don't fit

Not to mention the distance between our parents' houses

Shared some money with 'em so they know I care about 'em

I'm tryna do it right and figure what a fair amount is

But I fantasize 'bout a day that we all swimming in it

No contracts and we independent

Stay close, never start a convo' with ""It's been a minute""

'Cause it never will be end of sentence

Nemo, that's my right hand, guides me through my indecisions

Vodka in my left hand takes away my inhibitions

Way too gone but I'm waking up in mint condition

In and out the rented van, pull up, get the levels right

Get a bite to eat, do the show, and then we settle like

What could be a better life

But I'm still staring at the ceiling in my bed at night

Thinking 'bout what I don't got yet

Why I'm not high yet

Why the last project something that I thought would make me something that I'm not yet

It's all a work in progress

That's what they tell me and I respond with ""I guess""

It might never be time

Oatmeal Creme Pies and looking at the street signs

I guess that he gon' be fine, or she will

When our hands can't keep still

And if it's not Insta then it's emails

There's beauty in the details

I'ma try my best to pay attention to 'em

Spend your day with this and it can get you through it

I ain't seen an institute since I ended schooling

Used to hate it now my dreams take place in it

Sun shine through the blinds 'til I wake in it

I just got done stretching like the 8th inning

Now it's time to get something 'fore the day's finished



I got well wishes in my cell phone from my classmates who let themselves go

Well aware that I'm well known

Know we had a stretch of time between us that you felt close to me

But it's been a minute since

Did I change or did they rob me of my innocence

Inner-city kids I grew up with, we had some differences

But inside gymnasiums it's almost like they didn't exist

Times tickin', my mom's fifty

Told me that she's been thinkin' 'bout spending time different

It's more precious, what if I took the same method at twenty-one and adopted it

Sometimes I feel like I'm tripping for dipping out of town while my pops' living still

Palms itching, but this money has not been a drill

Ain't no pattern to the way I tend to feel

It's all, over the place

I'ma, lower the shades to sleep in

I ran into a little kid I grew up with

He shook my hand and told me, ""No one thought you'd do this shit""

I can't relate, but see I understand

'Cause when they hear me now compared to back then it's like, ""Who is this?""

Don't know if I changed but the music did

In my old shit I used to just admit things

Now I sit around and wonder, ""Is that something you admit?""

'Cause when I hear it all I do is cringe

I guess I did change

Two years in ATL

Before I moved I had never got drunk

Now I'm getting tore up like an ACL

Meeting people that my friends idolize

That they only ever get a chance to see on they TL

Artists that they playing through a JBL

In somebody's basement, smoking getting wasted

Something in the air and I can taste it

Twenty-eighteen I could't be on my own

Every night I'd call a girl and fall asleep on the phone

I guess it was how I coped with leaving from home

Discipline, I gotta keep in control

It gets more difficult to rap every day

'Cause it's less and less things that feel like worth saying

Nothing is for sure except life sure ends

I try to keep that in mind but it's not workin'"
