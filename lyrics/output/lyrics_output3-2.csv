1lmZXJiHlLbA7tgoTXctwb,Pop Off (feat. Casanova),"[Intro: Cardi B]
Shattering glass
And motherfuckers be like, ""But what type of niggas will wife you?""
My type of niggas will wife me! The type of niggas that like bitches that pop off and suck dick all day motherfuckin' long, bih
Thanks to all my followers that always defended me
Y'all like my god brothers and my god sisters
I would dead jump in your fight, I would dead jump in your fight
Now what's poppin?

[Hook: Cardi B]
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I'm startin' to lose my patience, weak bitches hatin'
Bitches throwing subs like I won't kick your face in
Baby mama's mad 'cause I'm in first place, and
When it comes to you bitch, there's no conversation
I been to give it up grimy, I'm the Bronx bitch, I'm feisty
""Cardi why you feisty?"" Shut up bitch, fight me
NY raised and so you know it's very likely
That when I hear some shit that I don't like, I get hype B
Who would wanna wife me? Your nigga wanna wife me
You think 'cause I'm a stripper hoe, that nigga won't think twice B?
Put this pussy on his face, ride that shit nicely
Set his ass up, then you really ain't gon' like me
So what you tryna do? You and you and you
I feel some type a way, a bitch finna get loose
Tell me what's the deal? I'm 'bout to start the hill
The wig is comin' off, shit 'bout to get real

[Hook: Cardi B]
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off

[Verse 2: Casanova]
Got beef with Cardi B? I'm poppin' off
Shit get hectic? I'ma drop it off
Oh you shinin'? Your chain and your watch is off
You was never with this shit, nigga, knock it off
Youse a pussy, and your whole block is soft
You caught feelings, could she ain't even drop you off
You thought that bag was gettin' you pussy, not at all
You was gettin' lied, you ain't know she made that call
To the dog's dinner, and they starvin'
I gotta feed all 'em
I'maget that nigga, you gon' get that bitch
What they thought switched 'cause we both got rich?
Nah, we on the same time
You got yours, I got mine
You got a problem, get in line
It's Cardi B, and 2 times

[Hook: Cardi B]
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Shit, that bitch six three and she bodied
Superman calves, and her shoulder somethin' retarded
I ain't backin' down, Cardi got the heart regardless
You gon' have to knock me out if you think I'ma forfeit
Gang gang, squad up, and have my niggas all on it
Pay a couple niggas and they had you out in a coffin
And I put that on my life, I really don't do this often
But the way I'm feelin' now, like whatever, I'm on it
Have you laid out on the stretcher with your socks off
Had the pastor prayin', like, ""Sorry for your, loss""
Throw dirt on my name, you better pop off
My name ring bells like Mayweather, box off
I'm Cardi B, east coast newest contender
5'3"" lookin' good with the nails bananas
Freddy Kruger on these bitches, I cut their lights off
Should have read the memo, Cardi B pops off"
4cxKwt0mdy35povvGlyirE,Trust Issues,"[Chorus]
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back, that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold
Middle finger up to you hoes
Hating on me, I'm making moves on the road though
And I don't really trust them no more
I don't really stress it no more
I don't be trusting them, I don't be trusting them

[Verse 1]
Carbi B, me, bad one
You bitches, sad ones

All them bitches broke and they mad I just dab on them
Wave bye, hit the gas on them

I don't say much, I just swag on them
I be killin' them, I go Fab on them
Left right, throwing jabs at them
Night night, I'ma black on them
Hit the game raw, no Magnums
Can't stop winning, God, finna go platinum

[Chorus]
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back, that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more

[Verse 2]
NY, Cardi next in line
Yeah, it's my time, real hittas gonna respect mine
I got deadlines, I'ma hit the headlines
Ain't no bedtime, young boss, nigga, I ain't lying
I fuck shit up then I come for my checks
What you expect? Cardi in full effect
I see they mad, I see they vexed
But it's not my fault when I shoot it's all net
Like swish, now they look at the flick of the wrist
They sending shots but I swear it's all miss
Cardi fall off, yeah, bitch, you wish
You must be drunk off all of those liqs

I gave you more than I give myself
So loyal to you that I betrayed myself
Well, I guess I'ma wither away
You a snake, and you chose to slither today
I gave my all; my love and my trust, but
I guess my all just wasn't enough, yeah
There's something about you; I can't help it
But I'ma do for myself, I'm being selfish

[Verse 2: Josh X]
Babe, your melody is the voice I need
Makes me skip a beat, yeah
And baby, you know it, yeah
But it's hard to show it, yeah, yeah
See, the one I love used to be in clubs
Used to fuck with thugs, yeah
And I can't expose it, yeah
'Cause she already know it yeah, but

[Chorus: Josh X]
Why don't you ask me
Why is it so hard to fall in love
Why don't you ask me
Why can I never ever ever trust?
Why don't you ask me
Why everything is going in circles
Why don't you ask me (I guess you never know)

[Post-Chorus: Josh X]
I guess we never know
They say the one that you truly love
Hurts you the most
Now the one that I truly love
Hurt me the most
Now the one that you truly love
Is hurting you the most
I guess I'll never know
Why I got so cold, it's not your fault, girl

[Refrain: Cardi B, Josh X]
Be selfish, be selfish
Be selfish (I’m so cold, girl)
Be selfish, be selfish
Be selfish (It’s not your fault, girl)
Be selfish, be selfish
Be selfish (I’m so cold, girl)
Be selfish, be selfish
Be selfish (It’s not your fault, girl)

[Spoken Outro: Cardi B]
Withering away as I gaze at the sky. Looking at his face, and all the pain it caused me. I ask why. Didn't I love? Didn't I give you more than I ever gave myself? What do you wish, 'cause that part of me no longer exist? This time I'm first, I'm picking me, I finally learned to be selfish."

Your mouth can cost you, and I’ll make sure that you pay the price
So don't be lackin' when you comin' home from work at night
You run your mouth; I'm poppin' out, now it's on sight

Silence, silence, I don't hear a thing
Worry 'bout me, but your pussy smell like turtle tank
I pull up on that check, nothing less, that's all I do
T—T—Ten bands, fifty bands, ain't nuttin' new
I see some people who still worried 'bout my revenue (Why you worry?)
I'm eating good, you wish you could, don't worry about my food
And niggas hating on a female, ain't no way to live (Lil bitch)
You bitch-made, make me wonder if you got a dick (Lil bitch)
How you feeling like a man envying a chick? (Pussy)
Wake up and go get some money, go and find your niche (Get that money)
Silly motherfucker (Silly,) who raised you? (Who raised you?)
A nigga with a pussy? How disgraceful (Oh my God)
I have my hitters come, and duct tape you
And your bitch could get it too, double date, boo
So let's get it, so let's get it, so let's get it
Let's not waste a minute; you clearly started, so let's finish
I don't do forgiveness; they take your kindness for a gimmick
I'm just here for business, I'm running down and I'm with it, bap

Let me tell you a story about these two guys
That eventually became brothers
You got this kid named Tune
Tunechi, some shit like that
Straight out of 17th of New Orleans
Been rich since he was like thirteen, fourteen years old
He came with his own style
They tried to steal his shit
He ended up puttin' the whole game on his back
Had clientele for years and always had good product
And then you got Slim from the Southside of Atlanta
Loved playin' basketball, he a real Mama's boy
And that's how he got the name Tity Boi
Slicker than a spill of oil
Soon as he got his hands on his first pack
He flipped that, he never looked back
And when they met up and devised a plan
On how to take over the land
It kind of went like this

And my semi-automatic, and my drip on autopilot
And my jewelry on sarcastic, my money on plastic
When it comes to dead presidents, I'm a bastard
And all my bitches passivе, and all my hoes erotic
And my dick on automatic, and my drip on autopilot (Yeah)
Drippin' so hard, might go on a watеr diet (Diet)

Money pull my pants down, I'ma need a drawstring
Ask me, did I have anything to eat? I told her, ""Cocaine""
Big flames out the muzzle
Customers was often puzzled at the fact that I was humble
They say, ""Life a bitch,"" I'ma smut her, need a couple rubbers
Had a girl named Nina, all we used to do was smoke and cuddle
You already know, I need a couple million on the double
Anybody seen my ceiling? (Where?)
My nigga got locked up and started sellin' dope in prison

From the top floor to the lobby, lovely
I need love but I'm tired of searchin'
Clean tub, dirty shower curtains
No cap like bottle service
Need a road map to the hottest person
I'ma toe tap on the hottest surface
And this hard D probably got her thirsty
In the pussy, I don't show a lot of mercy
I'ma fuck her 'til she scream, ""Lord, have mercy""
No controversy, just contraceptives
Contraband for the conscious effort
Prayer for strangers doin' stranger things
And baby, I cannot change a spotless leopard
Full time love, part time love, one time love, hard time love
In time love, love is on time love, long time love, all time love, all my love

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I want someone (Yeah) who's there for me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, I need somebody, I need somebody, girl)
Without a guarantee (Ooh, I need somebody, girl, ooh)
How can I be there for me? Hmm (Yeah, ooh, yeah)
Consistency
Is all I ever needed with you (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And you put me through it (For a part time love, yeah, yeah, I need somebody)"

Checkerboard luggage, Ramen in the cupboard
I left Art Basel with a sculpture
You listening to the lyrical nunchuck chuckle at dumbfucks
Vocals warmed up, beyond Ford tough
I kept my lawn cut, it's felon conduct
I got my arm out the window of an armed truck
It's Teamster Union when you hear the trucks roll up
On Cleveland Avenue, made plays at the Kroger
Came up on cold cuts, heart got a hole in it, bank got a roll in it
The Cessna Citation came with a pole in it
The Cullinan so big, it need a stove in it
Now that's deep, I just dove in it
The closet came with garage doors
The Goyard is on all fours, I do this shit for encores
I did this shit in Tom Ford, they said I'm wrong for it
I'm so fly, I looked at her and said, ""Get on board""
It's the man, it's the myth, in the midst of the mix
With the M's on my mind, in Maui taking pics
Motivated by more, that mean I want more of this
I want more jewelry, more cars, I want more cribs
What you expect from a kid
That grew up with his stomach touching his rib?
Echos coming from out the fridge
My papa was a rolling stone, I thought you knew that
Don't smoke no cig but I'll shoot that, true facts

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Nah'mean?
My lighter St. Laurent
Yeah, that St. Laurent fire
You gotta hold your hand midair when you do a verse like this

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, hoppin' out a slide out, runnin' through a walkthrough
Coupe on big wheels like a pony wearin' horse shoes
Tall money, short fuse, long money, long ooh
Champagne Papi part two, she my corkscrew
Tattoos over war wounds, wrist look like it's on Zoom
Neck look like anime or cartoons, art to 'em
I got the spikes on the Gucci, look like Bart to 'em
Gimmie the Nikes, lemme add some Comme des Garçons to 'em
Stunt man, verses in my lunch bag, rappers on my launch pad
Chopper make 'em do the Kris Kross or make 'em jump dance
Lump sum, hump bands
What's a young man without a check? Just a Jumpman
Fuck that, Jordan meme
I'ma sip some lean, get a ting and go quarantine
I'ma get some bling let it bling like some Oil Sheen
I'ma put some fuckin' princess cuts on a queen
And I keep all of the chin check stubs I redeem
This our team, my regime, I'm a higher being
Purple smoke, fire green, sweet 'n' sour cream
Peakin' higher now we towering, peak position
Give my people power, now we power fiends, it's addiction
Feelin' like a boxer steppin' out the ring, you swing, you missin'
Critically thinkin' 'bout the critics up in critical condition
I'm in pitiful condition, scratch that but who was itchin'?
Teamsters, the Union did it, Tune and Tity, Young Money, T.R.U. Religion

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
It's some Teamsters shit
This a Saint Laurent lighter, woo!
I got ""stoner-virus"", baby
Ho right there, she got ""Patron-a-virus"", hmm-mm

So now she got ""lonely-virus"", alright
Ayy, stop leasin', niggas
We gotta get that ""homeowner-virus"" like me

[Verse 3: Benny The Butcher]
Yo, they was laughin', but we was smart drug trafficking, we was sharks (Uh-huh)
I had to chase the paper down 'til we trapped the money in vaults
Kinda crazy, my last bid was the shortest and she ain't wait for me
Spent half my twenties in prison and aged gracefully
For paper, you know we grind, place a wager and you'll be fine (Uh-huh)
I put my fork down, now every major want me to sign
Left the hood for Hollywood, it wasn't worth being famous (It wasn't worth it)
Where every chick got a Beamer and a personal trainer (Ha-ha)
I'm into business moves, she into Paris fashion (Uh-huh)
It cost me at least twenty grand a year on her hair and lashes
Love I'd inherited, music was both of my parents' passion
My name come up when you talkin' dope and comparing classics (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Stare at me good, 'cause this how pressure look
They want my spot but tryna skip every step I took, I wish 'em the best of luck
I asked a question and he gave me an answer
That still left a nigga confused like Brady in Tampa
Back home, I'm one of the Narcos, semi-autos
Dodge feds like New York City potholes
Yeah, the OGs think that it's funny, money made me more hungry
'Cause majority wait 'til they chubby and then get comfy, nah
Get that first taste then you learn to appreciate
All the risks you gotta take to turn a Ford to a Wraith (Uh-huh)

The bezel on the watch cost more than the watch itself
I don't do TikTok, like a Rollie, but watch yourself
You just like a pimple 'til I make you pop yourself

So like Bruce Willis, I die hard
My God, you catch feelings, that's my fault
Feelings hurt, I put them on I-R

Put 'em on some much loud that they won't make a sound
This that body rock, nonchalant, don't make sense

Heart not hard to stop, take a new whip then karate chop
Turn the fuckin' top to a halter top
Concrete jungle, I'll fuck Jane though
Industry, a bunch of niggas swing on the same rope
Sit in the same room, fuck on the same ho
We on different planes if we is in the same boat
Captivate 'em and creative
Potato head, turn 'em into mashed potatoes
My town is greater, downtown Decatur
Went to Pin Ups to pound, pound a waitress
Niggas might as well smoke a pound of hatred
Take a shot of jealousy and use a clown to chase it
Heard some niggas try to say that my style is basic
Told 'em sit back with they style adjacent
Ran up in they crib like my stylist Jason

And I don't text or call them hoes, restaurant 'em all them hoes
I slept with foreign hoes that only heard Tha Carter IV
It's all for show, it's all a hoax, Rebeccas to Rosarios
I'm sorry for the hoes that get portrayed as sorry hoes
I'm sorry, hoes, but that's just how the story goes, who are these hoes?
Who bought these hoes? I thought these hoes was for us all, my dawg proposed, Lord
His cards exposed, his heart explode, his broads opposed, Lord
His market's closed, he parched, he's cold, she sparked the stove, Lord
She washed the clothes, she fold the clothes, she on her toes, Lord
He lost control, forgot the bitch was on the pole, Lord!
And oh, Lord, I bought some bitches from the road home
Told Hood, ""Watch over them bitches like a fuckin' drone""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Un-fuckin'-believable, I don't fuckin' believe in you
I'll get you shot up in front of a cathedral
And in front of the media, that's from me to you
Heard the feds been meetin' you
A whole lot of shit that you've been agreein' to
Who you speakin' to?
You foreign to me, nigga, that's the European you
You should hate bein' you
One of these choppa bullets'll make three of you
Pull up in the vehicle, pow
Pull off laughin' lookin' in the rear view
Ain't no tellin' what we'll do
When it's them or me, him or me, or me or you
Watch how the semi do, it'll turn the grizzly into Winnie Pooh
Believe that, no Corona, I'ma pull up in a fuckin' ski mask
Niggas rattin' on us and I'm too grown to be a Chuck E. Cheese fan
He-Man, smokin' the strong, the blunt is longer than me hand
OG strains, stay in my zone but sometimes known to freelance
Pecan skin tone, but redbone when she mad
And she can, watch the throne to kiss my royalty ass
I can't believe you, quarterback to wide receiver
Can't trust you far as I can throw you, far as I can see you
Un-fuckin'-believable, Lil Wayne's the president

No, I can't, I can't, can't believe you (Yeah)

I ain't talkin' shit, I'm garglin' the toilet water
Ballin' harder, Glock 40 on me, that's the party starter
In the cell starin' at the bars like I'm on the charger
Came out at a hundred percent, money to spend
Nothin' to lose and somethin' to win, once and again
Jumped in the pool with her and her friend, none of us swim
Bussin' a move like bumps on her skin, nuts on her chin
Fuckin' with Tune just doesn't make sense, gun in my clench
Gun is so huge, I can't tuck it in, it's cuttin' my wind
Chuggin' the juice, my cup got a twin, this one is for Pimp
This one is for Screw and this one is for Nip, pour out and sip
Bubble gum cookin' banana leaves flip, Nevada heat list

Y'all niggas like protection, nigga, y'all might slip (Bah)

[Verse 2]
San Juan summer, sweating winter off
Talkin' prices, goin' back and forward like a tennis ball
Talkin' business, guns start ringin', that's a business call
It's only business, take a nigga chain like it's his business card
Clips extended, hangin' out the banger, that's extension cords
He's a pussy, he can't do a thing, now that's just menopause
Bitch made and I'm the switchblade that's sharper than a sword
I gotta stay up 'cause who gon' catch a blade when it fall?
Politickin' in the penthouse like it's the Pentagon
And we feedin' sharks on the yacht, throwin' niggas off
Can't believe the thots ever thought they'd throw a nigga off
Archer greens, sparks red dots glowin' in the dark
Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and all my pillows soft
Talkin' all that gangsta shit, how loud the sound of pillow talk
Steady is the hand that whip around the pot, I'm kitchen smart
Becky give me head, open her so wide, I hit her heart
Becky give me head, and use no Uzi, that's for intercourse
Becky give me head, and use my pubic hair as dental floss
Then of course, I put on all red, hop up in a Porsche
Fast lane, it's a man's game, meet me center court
Any sport, 24/7, no 8, nigga
Mamba mentality but we ain't got no snakes with us
They slither, diamonds in mouth look like I ate glitter
And bae brought her bae with her, double play, nigga, ooh

She say, ""Where the Uber at?""

Wait 'til you see your Uber driver's face
And I'll buy you lingerie
Yeah, I just hope you in the mood for that
Or we can talk and spark a J, lil' bae
Then, you get too faded, now you gotta stay
Either way, now you're fuckin' on a nigga from the Eastside
Yeah, and it's 'bout to get ugly
Turn around, I hit it from the B side
Yeah, make her scream, ""Young Money"""

[Verse]
Skip the BS and put everybody after VS
P.S., all I spit is F-A-C-T-S
The best, Skip Bayless, yeah, say less
Top of the top, apex, everyday flex
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin', I ain't tryna hate
Let's have a Jordan and Lebron debate, I got time today
Drippin' on the chain, my diamonds say what they gotta say
If you think it's a game, I commentate, I ain't got to play
On in the mornin', I own my opponent
My competition is not an issue, just cotton tissue, uh
Unconventional, controversial, convoluted
Unconditional, undeterred, and undisputed
No mercy (No mercy), no mercy
Unconvеntional, controversial, convoluted
This the nеw ""Undisputed""
Now let's go face to face, I embrace debate
I don't make mistakes, I just make my case
Drops mic' when I'm done, what more can I say?
Not bitin' my tongue, I don't like the taste

[Bridge]
And I won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down
Won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down
Won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down
Won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down

Huh, South Beach, spring, California, autumn, winter
I ain't talkin' shit, I'm garglin' the toilet water
Ballin' harder, Glock 40 on me, that's the party starter
In the cell starin' at the bars like I'm on the charger
Came out at a hundred percent, money to spend
Nothin' to lose and somethin' to win, once and again
Jumped in the pool with her and her friend, none of us swim
Bussin' a move like bumps on her skin, nuts on her chin
Fuckin' with Tune just doesn't make sense, gun in my clench
Gun is so huge, I can't tuck it in, it's cuttin' my wind
Chuggin' the juice, my cup got a twin, this one is for Pimp
This one is for Screw and this one is for Nip, pour out and sip
Bubble gum cookin' banana leaves flip, Nevada heat list
Champagne, Tropicana, sweet blend, Cabana weekend
Bitches tannin', poppin' Xannies, deep end, barely blinkin'
Twirlin' on the dick like ballerinas and balance beamin'

Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
Y'all niggas like my exes, still on my dick
Y'all niggas like extra ticks on my shit
Don't slip on this banana clip, get y'all ass split
Hella bullets and an extra lip, full ass clip
Trigger puller with an extra strength, good ass grip
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
Y'all niggas die, X'ing 'em off my list
Y'all niggas like lesbians, y'all might kiss
Y'all niggas like protection, nigga, y'all might slip (Bah)

[Verse 2]
San Juan summer, sweating winter off
Talkin' prices, goin' back and forward like a tennis ball
Talkin' business, guns start ringin', that's a business call
It's only business, take a nigga chain like it's his business card
Clips extended, hangin' out the banger, that's extension cords
He's a pussy, he can't do a thing, now that's just menopause
Bitch made and I'm the switchblade that's sharper than a sword
I gotta stay up 'cause who gon' catch a blade when it fall?
Politickin' in the penthouse like it's the Pentagon
And we feedin' sharks on the yacht, throwin' niggas off
Can't believe the thots ever thought they'd throw a nigga off
Archer greens, sparks red dots glowin' in the dark
Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and all my pillows soft
Talkin' all that gangsta shit, how loud the sound of pillow talk
Steady is the hand that whip around the pot, I'm kitchen smart
Becky give me head, open her so wide, I hit her heart
Becky give me head, and use no Uzi, that's for intercourse
Becky give me head, and use my pubic hair as dental floss
Then of course, I put on all red, hop up in a Porsche
Fast lane, it's a man's game, meet me center court
Any sport, 24/7, no 8, nigga
Mamba mentality but we ain't got no snakes with us
They slither, diamonds in mouth look like I ate glitter
And bae brought her bae with her, double play, nigga, ooh
Y'all niggas like, y'all niggas

Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
And y'all bitches look excellent on my dick

This dick gon' have that ho on cloud nine
When I leave, it's gon' feel like the sky fallin'
She want Lil Tunechi to titty fuck her
I cum on her chest, leave a mini puddle
She make 'em bounce, work them titty muscles
I want the bitch with the biggest bubbles
I want the bitch with the biggest couple
Big ass, big lips, that's a triple-double
Yeah, I'm trippin' baby
Yeah, until I stumble, Lil Tunechi

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Uh, like I got two left feet, I be trippin'
Like I got two left feet, I be trippin'
In a throne, I'm a king like Mike Bibby
On the phone, we call fentanyl Fendi
She on tootsie, it's pink and it's pretty
Your bitch lookin', I wink and she with it
In that pussy I'm sinkin' like dishes
I smoke cookies, hate milk and love titties (Titties)
Just some titties, titties
I smoke cookies, hate milk and love titties (Titties)
And that's when I say
That's when I say

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I say, ""Are you on your way?""
She say, ""Where the Uber at?""
I said, ""I'll meet you at my gate"", and wait
Wait 'til you see your Uber driver's face
And I'll buy you lingerie
Yeah, I just hope you in the mood for that
Or we can talk and spark a J, lil' bae
Then, you get too faded, now you gotta stay
Either way, now you're fuckin' on a nigga from the Eastside
Yeah, and it's 'bout to get ugly
Turn around, I hit it from the B side
Yeah, make her scream, ""Young Money"""

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish, ha!

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine

I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey, hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love (Ayy), never had a love (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly, it's like a blessin'
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sittin' here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, ah, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body (Hey)
Like you never had a love (Ayy), uh, had a love (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Oh, and you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listenin', but
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartendin' and strippin', baby
So don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You seen a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, oh

[Bridge]
See, I just want you to know
That you deserve the best, you're beautiful (Ayy)
You're beautiful (Ayy), yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual (Ayy), far from the usual (Ayy)

[Chorus]
You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker

And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
And I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it

Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that

I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger

Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!""

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Oops, time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

Yeah, I put my shades on

[Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

[Chorus]
And I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'

You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'

With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 2]
Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu

[Hook]
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'

[Verse 3]
Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him"" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothing, keep resting,""
She say, ""What's missing?""—""How you know something missing?""
He scratched his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,""
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, ""Ooh""

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,""
And if he say yeah, then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me a salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier!""
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,""
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ""Ooh,"" dead emotion (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah"

Покажите, как работают ваши плечи
Типа, я не знаю, зачем вы сюда пришли, но если у тебя нет зажигалки, какого хрена ты куришь?
Мы горячи! (Хааа)

Какого хрена, а? Куда пропала любовь?

Поклонись! Давай, бля, я не блефую
Целюсь в твою голову, как буйвол
Ты грубой, я головорез
Ты крутой парень, без шуток
Потом солнце умирает, но ночь молода
Алмазы всё ещё сверкают в грязи, хо
Какого хрена, а? Куда пропала любовь?
Пять, четыре, три, два, а где один, а?
Это дерьмовое шоу, и ты в первом ряду
Говоришь дерьмо, братан? Пусть твой язык покажет
""Деньги важнее сук и важнее шлюх""
Это всё ещё моя любимая цитата про любовь
Засунул внутрь пушку, нахрена?
Я сплю с пушкой, и она не храпит
Какого хрена, йоу? Куда пропала любовь?
Обменял лыжную маску на морду
Это кровавая баня, где пена?
Это бит от Swizz, сейчас начнутся барабаны
Если она сомневается - накачаю её наркотиками
Если она припьёт лина, поднимет тост с double-cup
Я получил полный костюм Hundos
Вот где сейчас любовь, где же ваш шум, а?

[Припев: Lil Wayne]
Какого хрена, а? Куда пропала любовь?
Пять, четыре, три, два, один и поехали
Поклонись! Давай, бля, я не блефую

Какого хрена, а? Куда пропала любовь?

Поклонись! Давай, бля, я не блефую
Целюсь в твою голову, как буйвол

Давай, бля, я не блефую
После драки у меня нет ни единой царапины
Пуф-пуф, бро, я раздражаюсь
Вокруг жёлтые бриллианты, я поймал солнечный удар
Я у твоей двери с пистолетом
И я не скажу: ""Тук-тук, кто там?""
Это джунгли, поэтому имейте все возможное
Для орешек, а мы поехавшие, так что
Какого хрена, бро? Вот откуда я, бро
Мы быстро растём, но роллим медленно
Мы показываем знаки банды, она бросает наркотики
Дреды свисают, как будто ты не знаешь
Положил в сумку зелень, как газонокосилка
Волосы оттянуты назад, как косичка
Лишний патрон в заначке, будто консоль
Слушаю Боно, пока ты слушаешь Дональда Трампа
Какого хрена, бро? Куда пропала любовь?
Swizzy - это шеф, и мне нравится мой ланч
Просто глянь, бро, туда идут Scuds
Вижу лопату, и куда же ты делся, братан?
Хмм, в неизвестность
Вернуться он может разве что через своих детей
Если увидишь, что в моей сумке - подумаешь, что я король наркоты
Он пустой, когда я отдаю его, так где же ваш шум?

Какого хрена, а? Куда пропала любовь?
Пять, четыре, три, два, один и поехали
Поклонись! Давай, бля, я не блефую
Целюсь в твою голову, как буйвол

You will need a gas mask, man
You snakes, stop hiding in the grass
Sooner or later I'll cut it, now the blade's in your ass
You homo niggas getting AIDS in the ass
While the homie here tryna get paid in advance
I'm staying on my grizzy, I'm a bona fide hustler
Play me or play with me, then I'm gonna find your mother
Niggas wanna eat, 'cause they ain't ate nothin'
But niggas wanna leave when you say you out of mustard
So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone
Leaving out, leaving behind just residue and bones
In your residence with Rugers to your dome
Like, ""Where the fuck you holding the coke?""
Holding your throat, choke

I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
'Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me 'cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

I call 'em April babies, 'cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear

Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve"

Raw, I'm sharp, my swagger like an X
I'm a motherfucking monster, I rap like I'm possessed
Call me Mr. Still Smoking, smoke it in a paper
The game is a bitch, hold that down and rape her
Yes I am a Blood but I be riding with my skaters
We probably smoking flavors bumping Tyler, the Creator
I'm an Eastside native, all my niggas Soo Woop'n
They went brazy when they heard I had a song with Lil Tunechi
Bitch, get some ice and pour my Sprite
And light my bong and my doobies
Fuck your producer, I'm the one who be
Producing my music
I'm a hippie surrounded by a lot of pot
Cock the semi
Drop you like an Otterbox
They sleeping on me like I'm rapping with a blanket
Kill a nigga, have him thinking that he planking

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
All-red plaid shirt, skinny ass jeans on
Them goons at your front door, choppers out: ""ding dong""
Didn't I change the game and put my motherfucking team on
Now let my chopper ring, blaka is my ringtone
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes
We hold court with them heaters, pop case open/closed
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed Oreos
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic's clothes
Ask them bitches, I told em hoes
They back it up like Sonny drive in Bronx Tale, Calogero
Lighter in my pocket, light the sky rocket
Pull them hammers out and run them nigga's like stockings
Got some niggas from my city
Thugga, Dizzy, Flow

Pull up to the house in somethin' you can't pronounce
All of my chains is out
Foreign lil' bitch, I'm learnin' her language now
I know what her name is now
But that ain't important, if he ain't gang we extort him
I keep my brain in my quota
I do the dash, I won't see flames from the motor
Stay in your lane or get over
Beep, beep, beep, beep, all of these bags, I'm a hoarder
All of this Actavis movin' as fast as a tortoise
Been ballin' since way back, back, back
Me and Lil' Rich, we been ballin' since Nash and Amar'e
I treat the cash like it's garbage
The greener the grass in the garden, I'm plantin' a forest
Red as the ants in the army
Your bitch gon' get F'd likе a test, she got class in the mornin'
Moonwalk, lеt the juice talk
Got sticks, got racks, no pool balls
Don't think I won't shoot 'cause I'm a superstar
I can shoot for the stars, hit a shootin' star
I can walk it like I talk it with my shoes off
Soft chinchilla in the villa, that's too hard
Fuckin' on a lil' bitch, said her boyfriend a crip, cut her off
Think she tried to give me blue balls
Cheek, cheek, turn one booty, cheek, cheek, turn one booty
Cheek, cheek, turn both booty cheeks, they go boom, bong
I got one hoe with me, she got somethin' for me
Let me take off this red and get blew on

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Rich The Kid]
Oh lord, oh lord, she said, ""I got ahead,"" she gon' blow off
Headshot, headshot, that tongue put my dick in a headlock, mm
Oh lord, oh lord, she said, ""I got ahead,"" she gon' blow off
Headshot, headshot, that tongue put my dick in a headlock, mm
That tongue put my dick in a headlock
She gave me some neck, stuck her neck out
I open her legs and she stretch down
She lay in the bed and it's wet now
She talk all that heat and she melt down
I gave the drill and it helped out
I gave her the D and she fell out
Put some ice on her finger, she chilled out (Big CEO)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid & Lil Wayne]
You rappin' that shit that you ain't about (Woo)
They really do anything for the clout (Clout)
His daddy a rat, he a mini mouse (Ha)
Ain't chasin' no bitches, we pick 'em out
These niggas be lame, please do not speak on my name
Show her fifteen minutes of the fame
Got a young nigga die for the chain (Chain)
Buy a Cuban like, have 'em knock out your brain
She wanna have a trust fund, baby
Open up wide, girl, just take some
I ain't gotta say nothin', she gon' just get naked
Young nigga really rich, nah, I ain't just fakin' (Haa)
Fuck is they talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
Why they hatin' on me 'cause I made it out? (Yeah)
Ain't fightin', been walkin' with hella knots (Yeah)
Took the Chrome Hearts and I made it hot
They really owe me a big, big, big check (Yeah)
I put it on and it's gone 'cause I trend-set (Yeah)
Hop in lane, might set my 'Vette (Err)
And go buy some shit that you can't get (Bitch)
I was proud of myself, bought the Prada fit
I don't need no deal with a profit spit
Why you play with the gang? Got a first-aid kit
Why he brought his hoe 'round? Now the bitch get hit, yeah
I ain't really worried 'bout shit
My baby mama bad and my bank account lit
Ran up the money, I ain't ask for shit
My son need the Pampers, I couldn't quit
Now I just might go and buy a Mercedes
Back-to-back, me and Tunechi got em' starin'
Don't call my phone, no clearance
I need a quarter mill for an appearance, bitch

Oh lord, oh lord, she said, ""I got ahead,"" she gon' blow off
Headshot, headshot, that tongue put my dick in a headlock, mm
Oh lord, oh lord, she said, ""I got ahead,"" she gon' blow off

Could have bought a house, but I bought a Jesus piece
Could have thought they were the feds how they stalkin' me
Could have put her in Chanel, she from overseas
Could have bought a Plain Jane, but her wrist freeze
Pocket full of Maserati, full of swiss cheese
Could have pulled up on a Jet, but did the Jet Skis
X pills triple stacked like Wendy's
Walkin' round with the 9 like I'm Drew Brees
Shootin' those boys, takin' Mickey D's
Tunechi in the lamb truck, I'm in thе Bentley B
You was tryna' get a dеal, I told him ""Sign to me""
All my niggas Rich Forever, how it gotta be
Wait, all you niggas bitch forever, you can't lie to me

My bitches on the base, I feel like a shortstop
And I just caught a case, I'ma still ball out

Flyin' her out

Pick a Bugatti up, put the Cullinan down
Tell your friends I'll fly every one of them down
Put 'em on a jet, tell 'em meet me in the islands
Said she wanna fuck me and all of my diamonds
My shooter from the trenches, got a chain, yeah, he shinin'

She say ""Watch these hoes, 'cause they leeches like Robin"" I say, ""No, Robin Givens""

Come up missing, think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smiling while I cut the ribbon
I took a pill, she took a pill, we was chilling, 20 minutes, now we feel it
She say ""I know you probably hear this shit a lot, but you the shit in my opinion""

Looked at my watch, like ""Fuck it, why not?""
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord

I’m at home on the gas, I call you when I’m on E
I’m  home countin’ money
I lose my count, I'm gon' freak
Bought a house the other day and gave all my thots they own key
I do it bigger than bosses
With all these sticks', we golfin'
With all this drip, it's a faucet
Turn all the pictures to portraits
Got too rich, I'm a target
My mama wish I would bargain
But I walk it like I talk it
Money talkin', they arguin'
I put my trust into funds
Make her dust off the ones
I drop some Tuss in my punch, then drop some nuts on her gums
Chuck the deuce up but to her that's just a couple of ones
When she get pissed, I ice her wrist and make her fuck with some gloves
I love her

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Now I bet she get a Birkin if I make her mad (Yeah)
Now I’m rich, I stuff a hundred in the trash bag (Rich) (Yeah, yeah)
Free my niggas, put that on my mama and my dad
Fucked her once, she say I’m the best she ever had
I’m a big boss, fuck her then I make her get lost
Cross ya out like criss cross
Buck fifty what my wrist cost
Just one call, we gon’ knock em’ off (Yeah, yeah)
Bought a crib, moved out at the loft
Bad bitch and the ass too soft
On the drank, I might doze off

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
But don't sleep
I might not hear my phone beep
I’m at home on the gas, I call you when I’m on E
I’m at home countin’ money

0EzUUIfVPuzzNXEEU9CxU9,Life Of Mr. Carter,"[Refrain]
What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Balling 'til my hair is as white as Johnny Carson
You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, ""Don't mind the little voices,"" woah

[Verse 1]
What's harder, love or Mr. Carter?
Especially when these hoes ain't right, these hoes ain't loyal
Shit, who's wrong? Who's right? Just ask my lawyer
Right or wrong, I'm still gon' take his advice, he take my orders
I'll be a-okay instead of alright, or kinda-sorta
And before I ever take that for granted, I take the charges
See, you can't believe in all of the hype you hear at the barber
If the odds are stacked against us, they're likely to stack 'em on us
Lil Tune, Jurassic in the room, Tyrannosaurus
I ain't steal it, I took it, I ain't crooked, I'm cater-cornered
And if my fruits of labor were ripe, I would have an orchard
But I'm nauseous from my ups-and-downs and back-and-forwards
Shit, Mr. Carter, eyes are always on you
So I smile for the cameras and hide from the reporters
Roll a blunt up in this bitch, when it burn, it start my motor
Shoulder shruggin' in this bitch 'cause the world is on my shoulders, shit
What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Tune in this bitch, let's spike the Holy Water
Tryna stay grounded, my flights said no departures
Shit, what's harder, murder or abortion? Woah
What's harder, death or Mr. Carter?
Is it easier to play deaf or to listen harder?
I'm like, ""Girl, what's harder than life for Mr. Carter?
Knock on wood, but with the wood comes termites and turmoil""
What's easier, to change diapers or back to normal?
Times are changing like Father Time just lost his father
What's harder, to ask for sorrow or to borrow?
Or to break hearts or get your heart broke? I don't know

[Refrain]
I ask, ""What's harder, jail or Mr. Carter?
School or Mr. Carter? The news or Mr. Carter?
Man, what's harder, drugs or Mr. Carter?
Judge or Mr. Carter? Court and order, yeah""

[Verse 2]
What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
I ride for this shit like a knight in shining armor
I pile up the dope and roll it tight like UnderArmour
Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas
I got homies from the old school, and we been lost our diplomas
Got some hoes from California, think they shit smell like begonias
Got a bone to pick? I pick it 'til you're boneless
Like I come from San Antonio, pop up at the spur of the moment, how you want it?
When in Hell, I'm a Roman; head on fire, I'm a comet
Heat up out my abdomen, and you know me
Man, I'm all about my business, business handle business for me
I know you know life's a bitch, turned her to a business woman, mind your business
I'm sayin', ""What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
What's higher, the price or Mr. Carter?
Should I call you Mystery? Because I'm right here to solve you
And if you start to smell fear or fright, I sprayed it on you""
I made it, and when I made it, you hate it, I made it, on you
You know the streets talk, my nigga, don't make 'em argue
Niggas faded away, I light one and get faded for you
I'm reclinin', Weezy Baby, La-Z-Boy you, they enjoy you

[Verse 1]
I just bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
Got too much on my mind, hit the blunt and reflect
When I was under arrest, my bitch was under duress
I bet she fucked while I was gone, then I doubled the bet
I smoke weed in Amsterdam and I smuggle the rest
I act like I'm shakin' your hand and you'll get punched with the left
And you can get killed for shit you said under your breath
And if you do choose to bark, it ain't nothin' to a vet
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Yo bitch about to swallow a bunch of me's, nigga
I got a white girl fuckin', suckin' me, nigga
While I'm thinkin' 'bout the days that it sucked to be niggas

[Chorus]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
Nigga, keep your head up like that gun to ya neck
And my bitch was scared to fly 'til we fucked on a jet
Fucked her in the cockpit, all these buttons to press

[Verse 2]
I just got myself a blonde with the puffiest chest
I just bought myself some time, wrote my Rollie a check
Ridin' in a double R, just regrettin' regret
Getting loaded more than once, no Russian Roulette
I just left King of Diamonds, I just fucked a baguette
I ain't called her since that day, I just wasn't impressed
Bull with a nose ring, startin' a bunch of BS
Hide the gun, knock on your door, dressed like UPS
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
I'm a bear coughing up a bunch of honeybees, nigga
Got hoes under me, like a submarine, nigga
Got a bitch with a clit like a butter bean, nigga (Uh)

[Chorus]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC (Yeah)
Bought my sons toys and my daughter a pet
Bought my homeboys choppers and my woman a dress
And to catch me if I fall, I bought my mother a net, let's go

[Verse 3]
Anyone could get knocked off, any bitch could get knocked up
Baby daddy get locked up, sell everything, put the house up
Don't say anything, keep your mouth shut
Except two words and that's ""how much""
If I do get out, we're skippin' town
She said what about her mama
I paused
I said, ""I gotta do what I gotta
Is you gon' ride with me or you not?""
And she start cryin' and said, ""I'm not""
And I paused
I said, ""It's probably what's best
Well, I'll be back when pigs fly
So they can't follow me on my jet""
I tell my pilot where to go next
I bring that problem to your doorstep
I catch you slippin' while you tired
Like the road wet, like it's no sweat
I'm Tunechi, hi, I'm here to collect
They wondering why I ain't gettin' no rest
'Cause that's just too close to arrestin'
And too far from ""serve and protect""
So, Police, read me my wrongs, or just leave me alone
Rubbing, squinting my eyes, I still don't see where I'm wrong
Sold my soul to the streets, they bought it previously-owned
Went to jail for a Glock and soon as I got home

[Chorus]
I went and bought myself a 9 and that new MAC-11
You talk shit at 10:59 and make the news at 11
Bitch, I'm the wildest motherfucker on a team full of rebels
Young, wild motherfucker to a MILF, cougar, leopard

[Verse 4]
I'm a lion, motherfucker, to these hoes 'cause you can sweat a little
Euro my secret weapon like Mark, Jackson and Stephen
I see plain-clothes pigs and unmarked intrepids
My bitch believe what I say, I told her salt was pepper
I'm cold as malts and metals, sell stolen parts, whatever
Put three holes in your head like a bowling ball, don't spare 'em
And all my niggas in jail, that's bullshit, I smell ya
Remember Destiny's Child? My favorite one was Farrah, man

[Chorus]
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
I know you don't want war like you just a cadet
Tell a motherfucker who next, ""Motherfucker, you next""
I'm the best rapper alive and they love me to death, bye

Oh, you ain't heard?
Him and dopeman ain't cool no more
'Cause dopeman tried to charge him double for the usual
Damn
You just don't hear good news no more
After I tell this story, I gotta kill who I told
Okay, his new package had came in
Had the whole house stankin'
Traphouse doorbell ringin'
Traphouse gettin' too famous
His traphouse poppin' all night
The porch light should be strobe lights
That shit them police don't like
You know them pigs no good like pork rinds
Gotta go home to that whore wife
That don't never wan' fuck, just start fights
And he just made a hard right at the wrong time
They pulled him over, if they only write him a ticket, he'll be alright
Yeah, right
‘Cause you know he fit the description of a black male that sell white
AK on the backseat
Trunk full of cocaína
He stepped on the gas and got ghost on 'em
His bitch scream like she seen one
He said, “Shut up while I speed up”
She said, “I think you lost 'em,"" now he think he lost 'em
Now he lost his train of thought
The voice in his head said, “All aboard”
And he woke up, don't listen to that bitch
She coked up off of his stuff
And he know it's good
Where the popcorn? This story good, call Hollywood
But anyway, let a nigga get back to it
He came to a neighborhood and he zig-zagged through it
He didn't see the lights, but he still heard the sirens
Cut off all his lights and they drove right by him, woo
Chapter two
Traphouse just got cable
Stuntin' on the neighbors
The cable man was the feds though
A four-year-old was in bed though
He woke up when he heard the Glocks cock
You wouldn't believe what happened ten seconds later
To be continued, dot, dot, dot

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ten seconds left, he gon' get it
Mag in his mouth, mean like a fitted
Caught him in the pool room, two to his head
In the room and boom, they did it, wow
Face on the ground, Ace of Spade on the ground
Run, bullets, they'll chase you around
Don't listen to me, these niggas ain't playin'
Yo, they'll lace 'em down, feel it
One hit Willy
Other nigga live with a milli
Other nigga ride him Phillies
Run through the hood, all blood, blowin' bills on grils
Just chillin' up in New York City
One got witty
Took his mask off, he a dumbass
Got him on viddy
Somebody yelled out, “Yo, that's 'Chelle”
Blaow, blaow, caught her in the titty, huh
Four more shells went to his face like gazelles
Bloody, they laced him up well
Niggas stop shootin', get the loot
Stop bullshittin', boy, you wild, stop playin' yourself
This ain't good, now they fucked
Police barricade the buildin', what?
Now we stuck
Now this clown-ass nigga just fucked us all up (Up)
Eleven more shots
Came to the door was the cops
Chain popped off, caught him in his top
Fell to the floor, damn four-year-old shorty just looked up
Said, “They got you”
Damn, another nigga dead
Another nigga head licked, damn, they copped out
What's it all about, kid?
Max out, shed, play the background, we's out
Mwah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
There's always more to the story (To the story)
There's always more to the story
You ain't hear it from me (Hear it from me)
And what you hear, don't repeat (Don't repeat)
Or disappear in your sleep
And you ain't hear this from me (This from me)
There's always more to the story (To the story)

I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no

[Verse 2]
Now beam me up Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With ""Stop snitchin'"" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the '90s, my dope ain't consignment
My coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
These hoes be relying, these niggas be lying
These niggas who snitchin' we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifyin', you know desert's quiet
So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizin'
You cuddle too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie, ""I know where to find him""
He said, ""You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor""
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a Chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
Call me the greatest or call me retired
It's up in the air like carbon monoxide
Bitch, we in the buildin', we started from outside
My dick is my third eye and she call it cockeyed
My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360
She get so wet, it can be sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F you, with a sick dick
Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick
Playin' my role, even with a thick script
Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip
Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift
Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip
Anything can happen, put the whats with the ifs
But what's with the ifs?
Just pass that weed like flyin' colors
Light green, teal, turquoise, purple
When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk
I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal
Papa was a rolling stone, worthless
Mama said I wasn't on purpose
That's why I got a ice box where
My heart used to be in this cold world
I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster
I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, GRAMMYs, Oscars
Knock you off your fuckin' high horse
Like a cold-blooded jouster, fightin' for my life
Praying to the ringside announcer

[Refrain]
It's so simple that it's complicated (Complicated), yeah
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em (When you made 'em), yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin' (I ain't chasin')
'Cause only in still water's when we see our faces (See our faces)
Real shit, tell 'em

[Chorus]
I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need that chopper with me
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper with me
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
Now beam me up Scotty (Now beam me up Scotty)"

Uh, we had lunch
We talked about love and shit
She looked me in my eyes
And then said the next dick she'd take
Would be her husband's dick, damn
See, I had the steak, she had the lobster
I say, ""I want you on my team,"" she say, ""I don't join rosters""
""Oh, believe that,"" and then the drinks came
And then the mood changed and then her answer switched
She let her hair down and lit a cancer stick
She saw it turned me off and said she tryna quit
She went to the ladies room and I hopped on my phone
Most likely she doin' the same thing

[Chorus]
Like, ""Girl, what you think?
Um, should I do it?""
She say, ""Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it""
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said
""That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga
That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga""
And then she say, ""If you do, you better fuck him good
'Cause if another bitch could, she gon' f—""

[Verse 2]
We had dinner
We talked about the future
She said I could have chose any bitch
I would beg to differ, but beggars can't be choosers, yeah, mmm
And see, I had the shrimp, she had the pasta
She said she don't like rappers, we got something in common
I said, ""Especially that nigga Wayne""
We both laughed and then the wine came
And then her mind changed
She loosened up her blouse, her smirks turn to smiles
It was a full moon when she turned around
She used my restroom, she say, ""You know, girl stuff""
She left the water runnin' and hit her girl up

[Chorus]
Like, ""What you think?"" (Haha)
""Should I do it?""
She say, ""Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it""
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said
""That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga (Yeah)

And then she say, ""If you do, you better fuck him good

[Verse 3]
We had breakfast, yeah
We fucked all night long and shit
We fell asleep naked, so when we woke up
She wanted that morning dick (I gave it to her too, hmm, yeah)
I had the grits, she had the waffles
She say she drank too much last night and I shoulda stopped her
I say, ""Believe that,"" and then my phone rang
She saw my girl name and then her world changed
She put her clothes on and said, ""I'm going home, Wayne""
I said, ""Lisa, chill,"" and that was the wrong name
She hit her girl up and said, ""I hate rappers""
And then her girl laughed and said, ""Bitch, what happened?""

[Chorus]
She said, ""What you think?
Fuck, why did I do it?
Bitch, I bet that nigga knew he was gon' fuck
From 'Hi, how you doin'?""
And then her friend on the phone say
""Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga
Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga"" (Yeah)
And then she said, ""Yes, I did, and I fucked him good
So I hope he tell his girl that I fucked him good"""

I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust these bitches
Haters praying for my downfall, at least they're religious
People in Hell, they want rainfall, your bitch just want these digits
I feel like I'm on her payroll how she pay my ass a visit
We put both iPhones on silent, both iPhones on silent
I only answer for my niggas, careful with that dialogue
Man, my house ain't got no house phone
My flip phone is a chip phone
Got a prepaid and that bitch on, but still, I use my bitch phone
'Cause I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust my SIM card
I got Siri talkin' dirty to me, tryna make my dick hard
I got Tunechi on my ringtonе, my children on my home screen
I choke you with thе phone charger
Sold more crack than my phone screen, let's go
Fur floor mats, I'm bare feet, nigga
100K a week, that's a bad week, nigga
I can sell dogs to a cat freak, nigga
Sell monkey bars to a chimpanzee, nigga
But you never know what you never know
Nigga sell you coke and it wasn't coke
Hang 'em off the building and let 'em go
That's how you make a statement that they should quote
I seen death around the corner
And I lived right by the corner store
I'm a hot boy, I'll burn your hand
I'm a real life Untouchable
I run the show, I run the show
Sell anything but my soul
And I'm prayin' that the only cuffs
That touch my wrist come with button holes, for real
Smokin' on the good
Killin' these hoes like Blair Underwood
Rest in peace to my daddy Rabbit, I swear to his lucky foot
Ever since he died of jealousy, I've been looking for a cure
You see, my daddy had that work, now they watch his son get to it
And just like he ran them streets, I run with bulls
If niggas buyin' I throw out some numbers to 'em
Numbers soundin' yummy to 'em
You need more, just call my ho, I gave her phone number to 'em
'Cause you know

I'm the one the tiger better have his eye on, okay
Fussin' with my redbone (Bitch), hang up when my high gone (Why)
Ball 'til I fall, and when I do, them hoes gon' pile on, uh
Assault rifle, now mouth off
Some niggas make it all the way to the top and ball too hard then bounce off
Like my homeboy, let his bitch cook the work and it came out wrong
Almost beat that ho to death, I had to call my plug and vouch for him
'Cause I ain't even got an ounce for 'em
I keep running out on 'em
Everybody gotta eat, just try not to leave the mouse crumbs
.223 right here, this to keep the whole house warm
Then I skate by one of my hoes house, girl, I gotta use your house phone

Well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

[Refrain]
I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me
Keepin' my two fingers crossed, but I'm still lookin' for peace
I been lookin' at the clouds, maybe they'll listen to me
Can't talk dirty to myself because the mirror's too clean
Tryin' never to look back because the light always green
It's safe to say I lost my way, but I never lost the lead

[Chorus]
And if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

[Verse 1]
Every time it beat, it break apart
I really think it's all my daddy fault
I can't find the keys to my heart
Think I'ma need the automatic start
Out there lookin' for love after dark
Then I get tired and it's an afterthought
Where's the love? Five question marks
Eat your heart out, I had to starve
It's the saddest part
I'm questionin' myself, I ain't gotta answer yours
Baby, that's for sure
I take a look at myself and then I just pass the torch
Baby, back and forth
I ask can we get together just to break back apart
Baby, that's the cure
Me, myself, I, my iPhone, Fantastic Four
Never knew 'take it or leave it' could be so literal
Never knew takin' a breather could be so physical
Never knew takin' it easy could be so difficult
Never knew takin' these drugs could be so spiritual
Never knew the chemist like how I know the chemicals
Never knew takin' a life could be so minuscule
Never know takin' chances will be individual
Never know takin' advantage would be inhospitable, how pivotal
Never knew the shit I never knew would be minimal, how cynical
Never knew love and hate were similar, identical

[Refrain]
I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me
Keepin' my two fingers crossed, but I'm still lookin' for peace

[Chorus]
And if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
If you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep

[Verse 2]
I can't find the keys to this life
Picked the locks, I might be a'ight
Close my eyes, I might see the light
Life is a bitch, she might be my type
Death is a bitch, she might be tonight
Haters kiss and dick-eaters bite
Tables turn every day 'n night
Three-sixty, three-sixty-five
I can't find no leaks to my pipe
Police can't find nor reason nor right
Been tryna let shit happen on the fly
But I can't find a seat on that flight
There's a private plane, that's simple and plain
Tickets at a more reasonable price
Sometimes, I don't know how it's gon' end
Even though I done seen the movie twice
Pop a wheelie, new motorbike
Some people like to live a slower life
Some niggas like to live cutthroat
I'ma be the nigga that hold the knife
You girl wan' hold me tight over night
Who am I to tell her wrong from right?
I'ma give her more dick than advice
You give her more strings to a kite
I just found a needle in a haystack, bitch, it's payback
I found myself talkin' to myself with nothin' to say back
And I just found the keys to a Maybach I had way back
Tryna find everything but my way back

[Chorus]
Yeah, well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
I been lookin' at my posse with a look of belief
I been lookin' my closet and it look like Paris
They been lookin' for your body, they been lookin' for weeks
They find you dead with your eyes open, lookin' for grief

[Outro]
I been lookin' at the clouds, they say they look up to me
Safe to say I lost some sleep, but I never lost my dreams
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep
They lost"

Bulutların içine bakıyorum
Yükseliyor muyum yoksa onlar mı alçalıyorlar?
Ölümün köşede olduğunu (dolandığını) görüyorum
Ve U dönüşü(!) işareti bir tebessüme benziyor
Ne yaparım şimdi? Kim beni nasıl bulacak?
Dönecek bir yer yok fakat dolanıp duruyorum
Sadece bir başka zenci kafasını kaybetti(!)
Hayır, tacını kaybeden bir kral
Bir numara değilim, bu doğru
Numara 9-27-82'yim
Renk körüyüm mavi olabilsem bile(!)
Tabağım dolu, ki favori yemeğim değil
Ama açım, çok açım
Para ağacının hemen yanında soy ağacıma ihtiyacım var
Cennet Bahçesi'nde bir demet yaprak ile
Bir grup Havva ile, hiç meyve suyu yok benim için
Gençlik Çeşmesi'nden bir yudum alırım
Bu yüzden eğer genç yaşta ölürsem, meyve suyunu(!) suçla
Beni New Orleans'a göm
Mezar taşı okunur: ''Ağlama, uyumlu (akortlu) kal
Beni hayata geri getir
Sırf bir hayata sahip olmak için bir hayatı vermeliyim (feda etmeliyim)

Yetenek Tanrı vergisi, minnettar ol
Şöhret doğuştan gelmiyor, mütevazi ol
Ve kibrin kimseye ihtiyacı olmaz(!), dikkatli kullan
Kendi yolunda kal, koltukta kemerler bağlı
Ve bazen müzik olmadığında
Çalarız kendi kornalarımızı, ram-bam-bam-bam
Geleceği karnında taşıyan kadın
Ve doğdu Tunechi, ""dan-dan-dan-dan-dan""(!)
Ona geri dönüş deme
Karanlıktı, şimdi döndü güneş
Bana sert vurdun, ama ardından yumrukladım
Tekerlekler kopup gitti, sürdüm jant üzerinde
Bu intihar mı yoksa yap ya da öl mü?
Daha yeni günler, ve daha mavi gökler
Kendime dedim ki, ''Yalnızca sen ve ben''
Sonrasında rüzgar gelip aklımı başımdan aldı
Tanrı bilir kimin için oradayım
Verdiğim son nefes için
Annem dikkatli olmamı söylüyor
Kafamın içindeki ses bana şaşırtıcı bir cevap veriyor(!)
Fakat kontrolüm üzerinde bir akıl kontrolüm var
Kontrolü kaybettim ama onu bulacağımı biliyordum
Kontrol edemeyeciğim şeyi Tanrı'nın kontröl etmesine izin verdim
Gözyaşlarını kontrol edemem, bırak akıp gitsinler

Поклонись! Давай, бля, я не блефую
Целюсь в твою голову, как буйвол
Ты грубой, я головорез
Ты крутой парень, без шуток
Потом солнце умирает, но ночь молода
Алмазы всё ещё сверкают в грязи, хо
Какого хрена, а? Куда пропала любовь?
Пять, четыре, три, два, а где один, а?
Это дерьмовое шоу, и ты в первом ряду
Говоришь дерьмо, братан? Пусть твой язык покажет
""Деньги важнее сук и важнее шлюх""
Это всё ещё моя любимая цитата про любовь
Засунул внутрь пушку, нахрена?
Я сплю с пушкой, и она не храпит
Какого хрена, йоу? Куда пропала любовь?
Обменял лыжную маску на морду
Это кровавая баня, где пена?
Это бит от Swizz, сейчас начнутся барабаны
Если она сомневается - накачаю её наркотиками
Если она припьёт лина, поднимет тост с double-cup
Я получил полный костюм Hundos
Вот где сейчас любовь, где же ваш шум, а?

Вокруг жёлтые бриллианты, я поймал солнечный удар
Я у твоей двери с пистолетом
И я не скажу: ""Тук-тук, кто там?""
Это джунгли, поэтому имейте все возможное
Для орешек, а мы поехавшие, так что
Какого хрена, бро? Вот откуда я, бро
Мы быстро растём, но роллим медленно
Мы показываем знаки банды, она бросает наркотики
Дреды свисают, как будто ты не знаешь
Положил в сумку зелень, как газонокосилка
Волосы оттянуты назад, как косичка
Лишний патрон в заначке, будто консоль
Слушаю Боно, пока ты слушаешь Дональда Трампа
Какого хрена, бро? Куда пропала любовь?
Swizzy - это шеф, и мне нравится мой ланч
Просто глянь, бро, туда идут Scuds
Вижу лопату, и куда же ты делся, братан?
Хмм, в неизвестность
Вернуться он может разве что через своих детей
Если увидишь, что в моей сумке - подумаешь, что я король наркоты
Он пустой, когда я отдаю его, так где же ваш шум?

I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too

Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,""
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ""Ooh,"" dead emotion (Ooh)

2UXI6LFF0rcoeOhiUL2RJM,Open Letter,"[Intro]
Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that."

I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, ""Oh my God""
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, ""Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me""
'Cause superstars don't sparkle, superstars beam

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer: ""Don't let me make these bitches famous""
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, ""Can you look this way? Can you look this way?""
Flash! I must be famous

I stick her hands in the fan blades, nigga
That's when she told me where her man stayed, nigga
I ran up in that bitch on a rampage, nigga
In the morning, brains in the pancakes, nigga
My bitch classy and she keep her classmates with her
Your bitch ashy and she keep a ashtray with her
Had to do it one time for my skate niggas
Skate up on you, blam-blam, skate away, nigga
Kick push, that means grind and get paid, nigga
These pay cuts bleed through the Band-Aid, nigga
So walk it like you talk it, sashay, nigga
Skate up on you, blam-blam
Okay nigga, I just left José nigga, I just left José, nigga
Federales on my ass, fuckin' had a boat chase, nigga
They didn't see no face, nigga
Your bitch spent the whole day with us
If she open her fuckin' mouth, knock all the white out, no racism
That's cold, homies, pump that bass, nigga
And sometimes we close the safe, nigga
But there ain't no code to break, niggas
I capitalize off my own mistakes, you lowercase, nigga
Your bitch cut her legs when they was on my shoulder blades, nigga
Don't hate (Don't hate) call an ace, an ace, nigga
Got Mack with me up in this bitch and a MAC just in case, nigga

Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess

But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO

My nights is a mess, my life is a mess

But you gon' have to excuse my mess

Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

[Refrain]
I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness

Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well, it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero

Couple a cracks in the mirror
Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live

I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror

And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up

Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, ""Why you leave your shit here?""
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, ""Pray""
She say, ""I need a day"", I said, ""I need a bae""
She said, ""Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way""
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, ""Let go my arm!""
She said...

Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out""
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, ""Let that shit work itself out""
""Let that shit work itself out""

[Interlude 1: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
C5
Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can hear them pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, ""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]
Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
Let it all work out (Phew)
""Let it all work out""
(But he said, ""Remember this:"")
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""And don't forget what I did this, bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch"")
""Let it all—""
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""Now I'm out this bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""I'm out this bitch"")
""Let it all—""
(""And it all worked out"")
Love you, Dwayne"

I got this chrome on this Bugatti, I'm strong in this Bugatti
Two V8s, ain't no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti
Bitch, I’m bad, I'm worse, I'll pass the purp
Don't fuck with me 'cause right now, I'm higher than Captain Kirk
I swear, I be the sickest nigga, you can ask the nurse
And if you throw it in a bag I bet I'll snatch her purse
OK, I spaz, I curse; you last, I'm first
I'm on your ass, like dirt; behind that cash, get murked
I'm talking big shit, nigga, join my hit list, nigga
What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss, nigga
Shoot the witness, nigga
Hold court in the streets and convict this nigga
Ol' dickless nigga
Man, I'm running with the blocka, Young Money, motherfucker
You think we gon' do our thing? Well, ain't it sunny in the summer?
And we coming for the commas, and whoever among us
And you know I'ma bust my ass until my crew very humongous
I said, T.I., hold your head, and Mack, hold your head
Wish I could but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds
And to my Bloods, code red, man, you know how we play it
And if it costs to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay
I—I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit
Take the brain off the whip; now, it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promised tomorrow
Now, women kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra
Fuq' roll them killer plants, the Little Shop of Horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make 'em look like Toccara
Man, I'm too much for these niggas and three much for these hoes
The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed
I love my baby mamas, they get my highest honor
Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard
Quarterback, shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards
Bitch, I ball hard, breaking all the backboards
Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdie these balls
In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls
Man, I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers, ugh
Now, get off my dick, I ain't fucking with you
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Redbone do me good, then her friend assist her
I mean, a bitch she never met, her best friend, or sister
I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho
Bullet in you boys' memory, now you act like you don't know
Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But Heaven or Hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'ma go
Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still ""long hair, don't care"" like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
I smash this verse, and I swag and surf

OK, No Ceilings, motherfucker, good morning
Dick in your mouth while you're yawning, I'm going in
Gudda, why they started me? Marley, why they started me?
I bring it to your front door like you ordered me
Back in this bitch, but a lot more rich
On my Papa Bear shit, need hot porridge
Got a lot more shit than you can ever fathom
A big-head nigga couldn't even imagine
The shit I do, most doers never done
I'ma fuck this beat, you bitch, ooh, you better cum
Bet I run this shit, I don't run from shit
I still b-beat your ass like a fucking drumstick
Weezy Fucking Baby, baby, make the ladies come quick
The money can't fit in my pockets, but I'll bet that gun fit
And I'm so unfit 'cause all I eat is rappers
And these rappers ain't shit, I like my fast food faster
Syrup got me slow like a turtle 'round this ho
And I'm flyer than the highest-flying bird around this ho
What's the word around this ho? You get served around this ho
Yeah, you get served like a fucking hors d'œuvre around this ho
I don't splurge around no ho, no, I don't shine in front of no bitch
'Cause after she get off my dick, I be like ""Find the front door, bitch""
I don't know why in the fuck your bitch keep coming by
I done fucked your bitch a hundred times
What the fuck your bitch got on her mind? My fucking dick
I call her ""dickhead,"" spicy like a Big Red
Strike you like a Bic head—your flow sick? My shit dead
Sillier than V.I.C. said, Soulja Boy and Arab
You should see my eleven-year-old daughter do they dance
I call it the Nae-Nae dance, proud to be Nae-Nae's dad
Gun on the waistline, leave you in the wasteland
We are not the same, I am a Martian, this is Space Jam
No Ceilings, R.I.P., Amen
Motherfucking caveman, beating on my chest
Young Money, Cash Money, and I'm eating all the rest
Nigga, no offense, sorry if you're offended
Riding high like I'm on 54 inches
Man, I'd rather chill with 54 bitches
Ch—Chill like— Ch—Chill like an Eskimo
L—Let's get more— Let's get more bitches
And I be like, ""Let's get more bitches""
Mr. Officer, stop arresting your bitches
Stop letting the messy hoes mess with your business
Mickey Mouse cheese, hip-hop Walt Disney
Sheesh, gosh, Oshkosh B’gosh
Smoking on that Bob Marley, listening to Pete Tosh
I—I—I do me; no, I do three
At a T... I-M-E
Why, when we say we Young Mula
The bitches leave y'all and relay-run to us
And payday comes sooner than later 'round here
And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mac, and Nina debate around there, yeah
You see it in my face, I don't care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there
I'm the best thing yet, I know I got that thing wet
Everybody wan' be fly but don't know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute
Now, I'm right back in it, like the drawers of the women
On a scale of one to ten-n, my girl be a twenty
My girl so bad, make a nigga think he sinnin'
My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me
Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies
All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E
Mic check, two-three; I am different like blue pee
And my girls be half-naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been riding
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stunting, but no, I'm just surviving
And I been here, but my soul is just arriving
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribing
Medication free, and for meditation, we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you'll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft, and bring the whammys back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami, though
I act so New Orl-e-ans, yes, I go pistachios
That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me
And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me
Hahaha!

He stopped running; the bullet holes didn't
Ugh, basically, I'm still a monster

I'm calling you daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy, daddy?
I need a daddy, daddy
Would you be my daddy, daddy? (No ceilings)
Come and make it Wayne down on me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Wide receiver Weezy, throw the pussy at me
The pussy lips smiling, I make the pussy happy
Take them panties off, the pussy lookin' at me
I'm the pussy monster, now get the pussy ready
I like to kiss. She like to kiss
I deep stroke and make her bite her fist
The lights is on, the night is grown
We get it poppin' cause we know we can't when wifey home
California kush - strong as a Titan - is what I'm lightin' on
We get high as fuck then we ""Just Do It"" put your Nikes on
Tattoos on her waist, she like the tattoos on my face
And if there's something she'd like to say
I let her say it on my microphone
She love my style...but that's expected
She coming back to you? The chances anorexic
I knew she had it in her, so I got it out her
She give me neck around the clock, I call it round the counter
She rub my back, she say I'm tight
She cook, fuck and clean
And still make her flight!
First-class pussy, crystal glass pussy
I get it wetter than bass pussy

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I likes it thick and red
Ralph Lauren spread
Lady in the streets, porn star in bed
She like to fuckfight, so we spar in bed
She got that pink pussy, I beat it orange/red
I fuck American pie and I get foreign head
She sit down and ride like I'm a thoroughbred
She kiss mine, and I kiss hers back
If she's a bad bitch
She deserve that
She send me pictures to my iPhone
Then I gotta clear em cause my girl be checking my phone
I'm in the Bentley with the mind blown
When I'm in that pussy, honey, I'm home

[Bridge: Shanell]
You dun been good, but you can do better
I dun been wet, but I can get wetter
Come and make it Wayne down on me"
76YNfvQTKTMhnFNmBOW1nt,I'm Good,"[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm so fucking awesome - my marbles, I lost 'em
I'm taking everything - everything but precaution
Your bitches wanna call us and text us like Austin
Pussy make me hard, pussy niggas make me nauseous
I've been on my feet since the day I started walking
Bitch, I think I'm MC Hammer, put the nail in the coffin
Sell coke in a drought, sell pussy at an auction
Bullets got a nigga running fast enough to race horses
Around here you sniff these lines, you don't cross 'em
Kill your ass and leave you behind like an orphan
I swear it happens all the time, very often
Still getting baseball money; Barry Larkin
Around here we play for keeps, yeah, we eating, but we starving
I get me a little money, try to spread it margarine
I'm flyer than a motherfucker, all my flights chartered
Green kush, red flag, black car, white lawyer, I'm good

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I say I go into my beastmode - rapping niggas, I eat those
I tell a bitch take a deep breath then bend them knees like a freethrow
I don't want me no good girl, I fell in love with these freak hoes
In my bedroom I make a movie, it's starring me with that Lee Rose
Cause I ball hard like D-Rose, my stash on closet
Racks in my pocket, these racks I deposit
Got racks on my conscience, money on my mind
I got shooters on my team, they got bodies on their nine
Look at that bad bitch right there, see that body on that dime
I ain't swimming in no ho, you know I'm probably on that grind
All these niggas hating on me, me, but I ain't on that time, time
Cause I be in the back, nigga, and I ain't talking about swine
I'm talking 62 West, they say a nigga too fresh
You a rat, your homie singing y'all should do a duet
Shawty told me she loving my swag, I make that pussy too wet
You niggas banned, and my hoes and I'm like why they'd do that? Go

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhm, I don't have a conscience, all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Bitch, deuce deuce, I smoke that OG killer Bobby Johnson
I'll olly over that bitch head, it's Hollygrove til I'm fucking dead
I did a bid for that toast, so fuck with me I'll treat you like butterbread
But I still go hard with no regard, Earth ain't shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I'll just beat him with a bloody ass bowlingball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer, don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two xanax', I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Take a bullet to the chest, be a man about it
Stop acting like a little bitch nigga, most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My money longer, my weed stronger
I feed hunger, I no longer get my weed from Fee
I pull that freedom of my waist, now watch me let freedom ring, ding"

Fuq', hit the weed
You got all that shit? Yeah, ugh, ugh

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I got Young Money up, and now, I got my feet up
Tune in this bitch, tell my niggas throw them Bs up
Doing what the fuck I want, hate me all the fuck you want
Real niggas fuck with me, and I don't give a fuck who don't
Lock the CEO up; and I'm the CEO, fuck
Prison in February, and I ain't in no rush
Drink 'til I throw up; nigga, roll more blunts
Ball so hard, man, I gotta go pro once
Hit 'em with the shotgun, call that shit the ""stop button""
Call me Dr. Carter, AKA ""Young Wild Nigga""
AKA ""No trial, nigga,"" AK, click-clack, pow, nigga
Fucking with the kid and you'll be missing like Bilal, nigga
Yeah! Haha! Swagger stupid, pack a Uzi
Hundred clips, nigga? That's a movie — Aim at your toupée
You sweet as Kool-Aid, cream brulée
I'm sharp as Blu-Ray, I fuck her today
Then she gotta skate — Young Lupe
I hit the beat hard — Bobby Boucher
I keep them tools on me, get the screwface
Flowers for the dead, here's a bouquet
L.V.'s, nigga, on every suitcase
Y.M., nigga, it's a new day
We the champions, nigga, hoo-ray
Yeah! Hammer in the Louis duff'
Take a nigga bitch, she gave me brains until I knew enough
Bullet come too fast to adjust
I don't give a fuck about my roof that much
So I put it in the trunk and then the coupe sped up
Take the chopper out the trunk and just shoot that up
I'm Weezy F., and the ""F"" is for ""Flame""
Eat these rappers, chef up the game
Shit on the track, shit on the train
Murder the beat—the beat was slain
Rest In Peace; that's a shame, he kill anybody song
Versatile as fuck, I switch it up like Dennis Rodman dome
No homo, you rocking wrong; Rest In Peace, my styrofoam
Now they wanna know what I be on
Get the fuck off my dick, my cock, my bone
B—Big money, my pockets long; New Orleans, I got my home
And they got my back—pause; no homo, no maricón
Smoking on that private-grown, it put me where I belong
All about my cheese; cheddar, mozzarella, provolone
Fuck her for an hour-long, let her take a shower, gone
Sorry baby, but I'm in my I-don't-wan'-be-bothered zone
Yeah! Haha, you're a groupie, get on your duty
Two women give me head, call that ""Two-face""
Bitch, I'm too great, take your food tray, I was born on doomsday
Ugh! Ai—Ain't no nigga like me
""What's up?"" to my gang, big Bs, like a Breitling
Take a nigga bitch, she ride my dick, like she cycling
Then, she can't walk, run, or jump; like white men
Ugh! F—Fuck you niggas wanna do?
No Ceilings, let the bullets rain on you
Weezy F., the ""F"" is for ""Fuck what you’re going through""
Make your people mourn you

Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such
Damn, where is the fucking trust
I'm tired of the hoop and hollering
I'm 'bout to take the coupe to Collins
Then take a female to the Island
Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas

And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreads braided to the back
I'm chilling but my swag on full attack
And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer, I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off
Yeah, I fuck you for an hour then I smoke it off
Swimming trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight

And he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me

7sYtgBHnF2D1mgA7vNXig1,Kobe Bryant,"[Intro: Kobe Bryant]
I want to be the best
I want to be the best, simple and plain
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
And that's what drives me

[Intro: Stephen A. Smith]
He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo' mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassin's mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant
There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Kobe doin' work, 2-4 on my shirt
He the greatest on the court, and I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the fourth ring like it was his first
Gotta get the gleam, do it for Kareem
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldstein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Kobe in the game, dunkin' on the whole
Black Mamba, attack, conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, or turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's goin', it's goin' down, yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown, though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

[Interlude: LeBron James]
I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry 'bout my shot
Cause I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work 'em like a auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with three seconds
And I bet we gon' win it all in three seconds
Ya dig
That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let 'em get to me
Literally
Step back and give 'em a three
Ain't no defending me

[Interlude: Reporter & LeBron James]
One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately, LeBron James
I've been quoted saying that
He's definitely the best player in our league
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our league
And there's not another guy in our league
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline face time
Tongue out like two-three
Even two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha brackets ain't for me
I will be jumpin' over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet
And all is Phil Jackson say is you
Better be passin' it to me
I put the master in the piece
Attack you like a beast
And I am starvin' for victory
And that means I'mma eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me

[Interlude 3: Elie Seckbach/Mikael Pietrus]
Seckbach: Who's the best player in the NBA
Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant
Seckback: Really? Why
Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic
I can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want
They want Kobe
And what he want
He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break 'em off, Kobe break 'em off, yeah
You better be where that Laker don't, yeah
Just give him the ball and he take it off, yeah
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol, yeah
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah
[I thought you want to be the greatest]
Uh, do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothin' wrong with doin' it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a all-star, been a champion
Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting
MVP, MVP
Kobe Bryant aka MV-me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he can't guard me
He can't guard me

[Outro: Elie Seckbach]
""So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was ... Kobe Bryant"""

And when I hit the ground I sunk
Yeah they thought I was down, I'm up
I was lost now I'm found, what's up
I came too far around to give up

Everybody was missing, they thought I would miss them

I started a system

I'ma blood walk on your sidewalk
I'ma slime walk in yo slime face
I'ma B walk on your sidewalk, on your front porch and your driveway
I put 10K on your head, my nigga said you ain't worth 5K, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
They drowning in the water, we can't save 'em
Blood all on the leaves and on the pavement
Weighs heavy on our brains and on our conscience
We know that tomorrow isn't promised

[Chorus]
Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get...

[Verse 2]
Then my diamonds start dancing
My houses is so killer, bitches call me Charles Mansion
Codeine, Adderal, Xanax, cars crashing
G3, G4, G5, I tarmac it
Dumb bitch, smart phone, calls dropped, she can't catch it
She get high all day, snort coke and drink Pepsi
Suwoo, Piru, this murder like Ja Rule
It's voodoo, it's taboo, my shooter shoot like Manu, pew pew
Achoo, I pray God bless you, I do
I lay you next to my shoe, don't get your flesh on my shoe
Run your mouth and we gon' slide, we slide
No lie I'm a blood repping 123
So 5, 45's and them 223's
And more 9's, Mac-10, 11's, 12-gauge
Numbers don't lie, lie
Run your mouth and we know it's
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies we know it's Sci-Fi

They drowning in the water, we can't save 'em
Blood all on the leaves and on the pavement
Weighs heavy on our brains and on our conscience
We know that tomorrow isn't promised

Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed

Welcome to the funeral, yeah
Closed casket as usual
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
The choir's singin' musicals
Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with that Uzi, though
And they look like they saw Lucifer
Rrr
Welcome to the funeral
We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke
(Phew)
That's just unexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them
We been to quite a few of 'em
The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

[Verse]
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Soul snatching, that's usual
Amen, hallelujah though
Whole family delusional
Niggas cryin' like two-year-olds
Bullet holes come through the doors
I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose
Damn, welcome to your funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin', though
Gotta die to see who you know
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin them
The preacher preach, we shootin' him
Now we need one for you and him
That's why they should cremate ya
Hope when you die they commemorate you
Life is a movie and it's in theaters
Some of y'alls already went to cable
Get shot from afar, you can get a facial
Black gun, chrome gun, interracial
Weed so strong, need ventilation
Funeral home need renovation
I got your mom's teary-eyed, that's precipitation
Nigga, when you died, did your bitch a favor
Nigga, we gon' mob like the Genoveses
Nigga, fat mob, I'ma Jenny Craig 'em
Drive-bys in a Winnebago
Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes
From a hundred feet away, now it's a halo
That's tomato sauce, Heinz 57
Catch up, nigga, you behind, where I left you
I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins
Uncles, aunts, and your nephew (Pfft)
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Look his pretty kid in the face, poor bastard
Tears runnin' down his bitch face, romantic
Two straps on me like the old Bo Jacksons (Bah)
In his face, closed casket
Send him on the highway to heaven, no traffic
My lil' nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic
He cried tears of joy, then he got 'em tatted
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Whole family delusional
Amen, hallelujah though
Choir singing musicals, Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with the Uzi though
They look like they saw Lucifer
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin' though
That's just unexcusable
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin 'em
I've been to quite a few of them
My nigga, got immune to them
Damn, shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Huh, huh, bop
Look his pretty kids in the face, poor bastards, goddamn

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down
Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'

Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard

[Verse 2]
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
I think in my backyard, I need an airport
Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Fab Five
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards
Oh, woah, mahogany, yeah, woah

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy

You dead, brother
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button
The gun headbutt you like ""Bang, bang, bang, bang""
'Til your heart stop drummin'
I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer
But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off
This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball
Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9""
But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga
Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid
I'm out of my Kufi, narcotic abuser
No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'
Your partners is poodles
Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless

Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry
I'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive
Designers, excuse me, massagers masseuse me
Oops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey
Turn you and lil' mami, to tuna salami
You pukin', she vomit, that's beautiful science
That's Tune in a Masi', that's who in a Hyundai
You stupid or drowsy? I pew in the 'Gatti
Pew, pew and I got 'em, pew, pew and I got 'em
Lil' Tunechi a shotta
Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta
Turn a nigga noodle to nada
Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie
This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it
I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head

I changed my mind a bunch of times, but that's just mind games

Do I look like I'm playin' with you?
I was runnin' from myself, and that's just who I ran into
Closed my eyes last night and had a dream I was dyin'
When I woke up, I was surprised, and I hate surprises
I hate to love, they love to hate, but when it's all synchronizin'
It feel just like the flames have died up in this cold state of mind
Promethazine tranquilizers as I say my goodbyes
Paid them no mind, and as I wait for my receipt
I just got my face tatted and it felt orgasming
I got on a straightjacket, then it must be fashion week
I just look like this, ho, don't be comparin' me

I'ma snowplow on that bitch until she freezin' cold
She gon' slope style on the dick until she eat the snow

I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin' when stars were abundant
Then shit happened, and all of the sudden the toilet start flushing
Try to avoid the confrontin', enjoy the consumption
With outside noise and seduction, it's harder to function
Look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
They told me that I know that I'm wrong, but I don't know what's right, goddamn

I gotta medicate so I can resonate
That made me featherweight, so I can levitate
Into a better place, I don't care where you stay
Better, they better, but that's how you better stay, wait (Wait)
Who's that peekin' in my window, pow, nobody now (Pow)
Two, no buss downs, one bling-bling, one bling-blaow (Wow)
Just fucked my ex, don't know why, don't know how
Play with that XBOX all night like a child
Oh me, oh wow, baby, show me around
I said, ""Show me your world,"" I said, ""Now, show me out""
Yeah, laid on that bitch, I skate on that bitch
I wave to that bitch, I gave her a kiss
Can't give her my world, but I gave her the dick

Welcome to the funeral, yeah
Closed casket as usual
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
The choir's singin' musicals
Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with that Uzi, though
And they look like they saw Lucifer
Rrr
Welcome to the funeral
We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke
(Phew)
That's just unexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them
We been to quite a few of 'em
The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

[Verse]
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Soul snatching, that's usual
Amen, hallelujah though
Whole family delusional
Niggas cryin' like two-year-olds
Bullet holes come through the doors
I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose
Damn, welcome to your funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin', though
Gotta die to see who you know
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin them
The preacher preach, we shootin' him
Now we need one for you and him
That's why they should cremate ya
Hope when you die they commemorate you
Life is a movie and it's in theaters
Some of y'alls already went to cable
Get shot from afar, you can get a facial
Black gun, chrome gun, interracial
Weed so strong, need ventilation
Funeral home need renovation
I got your mom's teary-eyed, that's precipitation
Nigga, when you died, did your bitch a favor
Nigga, we gon' mob like the Genoveses
Nigga, fat mob, I'ma Jenny Craig 'em
Drive-bys in a Winnebago
Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes
From a hundred feet away, now it's a halo
That's tomato sauce, Heinz 57
Catch up, nigga, you behind, where I left you
I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins
Uncles, aunts, and your nephew (Pfft)
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Look his pretty kid in the face, poor bastard
Tears runnin' down his bitch face, romantic
Two straps on me like the old Bo Jacksons (Bah)
In his face, closed casket
Send him on the highway to heaven, no traffic
My lil' nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic
He cried tears of joy, then he got 'em tatted
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Whole family delusional
Amen, hallelujah though
Choir singing musicals, Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with the Uzi though
They look like they saw Lucifer
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin' though
That's just unexcusable
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin 'em
I've been to quite a few of them
My nigga, got immune to them
Damn, shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Huh, huh, bop
Look his pretty kids in the face, poor bastards, goddamn

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down
Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'

Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
I think in my backyard, I need an airport
Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Fab Five
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards
Oh, woah, mahogany, yeah, woah

You dead, brother
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button
The gun headbutt you like ""Bang, bang, bang, bang""
'Til your heart stop drummin'
I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer
But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off
This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball
Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9""
But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga
Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid
I'm out of my Kufi, narcotic abuser
No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'
Your partners is poodles
Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless

Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry
I'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive
Designers, excuse me, massagers masseuse me
Oops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey
Turn you and lil' mami, to tuna salami
You pukin', she vomit, that's beautiful science
That's Tune in a Masi', that's who in a Hyundai
You stupid or drowsy? I pew in the 'Gatti
Pew, pew and I got 'em, pew, pew and I got 'em
Lil' Tunechi a shotta
Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta
Turn a nigga noodle to nada
Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie
This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it
I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae

He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head
He ain't got no credit and his Apple Card is dead

I hate to love, they love to hate, but when it's all synchronizin'
It feel just like the flames have died up in this cold state of mind
Promethazine tranquilizers as I say my goodbyes
Paid them no mind, and as I wait for my receipt

I got on a straightjacket, then it must be fashion week

Bezel it heavily, inspect it carefully
I'm smokin' like I'm in the Netherlands
Like I'm a hippie that's stuck in the 70s
You with your buddies, I'm with my bloodies
And this ain't no flag, lil' nigga, this rugby
Duct-tape that nigga up until he a mummy
Then put him in a freezer until we get hungry

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & O.T. Genasis]
Huh, I keep my foot on gas, bitch

And them birds in the tree get shot down to my feet

And when you greedy like me, ain't nothing better than beef

Then eat, and pick you little bitches out my teeth

Try, take it from me, and I'm aiming and beaming
Banging and leaving stains on the cement
Slide the crackers something so they tame the policemen
Left in a Porsche, came in a carnation
I'm fresh, yeah, the Gucci sweats came with the creases
I'm hot, but I'm cold, I just change with the seasons
Tryna put some cheese on my pieces
If you looking for your nigga, I be where the water gets deeper
Hugging on that money, tryna put it in a sleeper
Yeah, I'm here—who the fuck wanna say something?
Leave your whole head empty like a straight pumpkin
Make no assumptions, I'm hustling
Your girlfriend guzzling when you thought she wasn't
Name still buzzing even when I'm doing nothing
But I'm never doing nothing, 'cause I'm always getting money
It's that simple, jackass, if you don't get it, you're a dummy
And them niggas that diss me ain't nothing but pure pussy
Sure, honey, I done heard what you said
But if a nigga really cared, you'd already be dead
Just a young-ass nigga with some old-ass bread
Yes, I keep them dollars running like them bitches got legs
And my nigga Tez Po been riding with me since pegs
And my right wrist is looking like a cracked-open egg, that's—
White and yellow diamonds, adjust your lighting
I got 'em so mad, but, ""Oh, I think they like me"" (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)"

See, that other chick asked that, she said, ""Where the cash at?""
Rem said, ""Where the paper, plastic, product
And where the stash at? Where the keys to the whip
And the crib and where the address of
That bitch that be hidin shit in her ass crack?""
Niggas I'm fuckin' call me baby like I'm related to Weezy
Some of 'em call me R-uh, none of them call me easy
Found out I'm fuckin' her man, now this bird is callin' me screamin'
Chicken, wait, bitches I be fryin', they just call me greasy
See, I know he got a main, but I'm cool being the other one
'Cause he can't get tight when he hear I piped another one
I dont fall in love with them, cum and then I'm done with them
Most they get from me is wet pussy and some bubblegum
But, this one dude had me laughin'
If it's just one thing I can't stand, it's a baggy Magnum
Would've thought somebody threw me a camera
The way I caught a flashback
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at"

People are living, people are breathing. But—you know what I mean? That shit still was fucked up, and it's gon' always be fucked up. And people are still fucked up about it, and people are still fucked up over it. And people died, and that's what's real about it, so—you know what I mean? The streets is gon' always be fucked up"

I'm a jalape-nuh, boy, hot as Cayenne pepper
I'm from New Orleans City, but I take her to wherever
I'm tougher than leather, I'm smoother than suede
Always never broke, 'cause I'm usually paid
Got the Rover with the cage—kinda brown, off-beige
Everybody look at me, like I'm riding on stage
Got a woman named Sage—she twice my age
Every time she hit me up, she send a picture with a page
I ain't tryna fall in love, I ain't tryna get engaged
You can meet me at the alter when a nigga really dead
Every time I'm tryna leave, she beggin' me to stay
And I politely fade away, like my name was MJ
Then, she wrote me a note—guess what that note says?
""Wayne, I hope you still like me, but I go both ways""
And then, I said, ""Oh""; then I said, ""Okay""
Stabbed 'em up and got the fuck, like my name was OJ
If you lookin' for some money, bitch, my name is ""No Way""
Not tomorrow, not today, not yesterday
I'm Mr. President, as they say
And that Phantom fits me, like it's tailor-made
I can take them to war, nigga—bombs away
I been in the water, fucking on the marmalades
If you lookin' for some money, bitch, my name is ""No Way""
Not tomorrow, not today, not yesterday

Last week, I met a bitch, but I forgot her name
Short, sweet, red, cute—ol' vivrant thing
She got a earring in her pussy and everywhere else
She said she jog every day so she could cum on herself
Then, she tell me my love is the best she's felt
And she suck my dick like it's about to melt
She drink Vitamin Water—say it's good for her health
She can wrap my whole dick around her waist, like a belt
Then, here's another bitch—her name was Ayesha
She ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza
One time, it was so good, I told her, ""Order one more""
She said, ""It's not Domino's—it's DiGiornos""
There's another bitch—I met her at The Gong Show
Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show
She do my dishes, wash my clothes, and fix my cornrows
She do my dishes, wash my clothes, and fix my cornrows
I can't forget about my bitch named Meaty Boo
She's a young project bitch—I used to bring that ho to school
So, I brought the ho to the school; we standing on the yard
A bitch asked me—was I from the 17th Ward?
Niggas came out the cut and started muggin' me up
I grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck
Then, I told my old lady, ""I'll be back, you see
And hit me on my cell phone if niggas lookin' for me""

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
This song right here is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, lost city of New Orleans...we call him this:

Georgia (That's right) Georgia (Bush)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Now, this song is dedicated to the one with the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef with you-know-who
Fuck it, he just let em kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had our niggas sitting on top their roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lotta stealing going on
Boy them cops is killas in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and President (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady?
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some folk that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965: I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now it's (Georgia) Bush

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you
Everybody crying but (Georgia) ain't nobody tried
There's no doubt on my mind, it was (Georgia) Bush!
We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you
Everybody crying but (Georgia) ain't nobody tried
There's no doubt on my mind, it was (Georgia) Bush!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Now, I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the White House hating
Trying to wash us away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest
They saying that you gotta have paper if you tryna come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap
See we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses
The mayor say don't worry bout it
And the children have been scorned, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fat shout, to all the rappers that helped out
Yeah we like to thank all of y'all, but fuck President (Georgia) Bush
When you see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tig' cause he died in the storm
Fuck President (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still movin' then he holdin' it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tches
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yeah!

[Hook]
We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you
Everybody crying but (Georgia) ain't nobody tried
There's no doubt on my mind, it was (Georgia) Bush!
We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you

[Part 2: Weezy's Ambitionz, produced by Daz Dillinger]

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
Oh yeah
You thought we was done? Nah

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Money, money, money: get a dollar and a dick
Weezy Baby that crack, motherfucka, get a fix
Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich
Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist (Yes)
Yep, I'm a motherfuckin' trip
I'm a trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit
900 to a grand, get you 28 grams
If you talking bout bricks, I'm the interstate, man
And the women say ""damn"", them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed spring
Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine
And with no pen I'm sorta like a bomb ""Boom""
Young Tune, yeah that's what my people call me
50 thousand for the cross, tryna keep the reaper off me
I drink a lot of syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walking
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yeah
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yeah, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be the target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, Purple Heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game, no arguing
And I don't even write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep your bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch, log in
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin'
Mike Jordan, pardon my swag
But my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said ""fuck it"" - bought 2 houses in Miami
I can't wait to do Cribs; MTV, come on, get at me
Any rapper wan' get at me, tell ya label contact me
Half a hundred for a feature, wanna battle? I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of Miss Cita
Mom dukes, my Jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna be the boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Not a sim simma, 10 keys in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving: couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfuckin' ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin'
Spend a condo in the club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patron, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that rage flow
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hoes
Price rising for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got dough
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve
If anybody else want it, $60,000 a verse"

Ağlama, gitme
Yalan söylemeyeceğim, Seni seviyorum

[1. Verse: Lil Wayne]
Bulutların içine bakıyorum
Yükseliyor muyum yoksa onlar mı alçalıyorlar?
Ölümün köşede olduğunu (dolandığını) görüyorum
Ve U dönüşü(!) işareti bir tebessüme benziyor
Ne yaparım şimdi? Kim beni nasıl bulacak?
Dönecek bir yer yok fakat dolanıp duruyorum
Sadece bir başka zenci kafasını kaybetti(!)
Hayır, tacını kaybeden bir kral
Bir numara değilim, bu doğru
Numara 9-27-82'yim
Renk körüyüm mavi olabilsem bile(!)
Tabağım dolu, ki favori yemeğim değil
Ama açım, çok açım
Para ağacının hemen yanında soy ağacıma ihtiyacım var
Cennet Bahçesi'nde bir demet yaprak ile
Bir grup Havva ile, hiç meyve suyu yok benim için
Gençlik Çeşmesi'nden bir yudum alırım
Bu yüzden eğer genç yaşta ölürsem, meyve suyunu(!) suçla
Beni New Orleans'a göm
Mezar taşı okunur: ''Ağlama, uyumlu (akortlu) kal
Beni hayata geri getir
Sırf bir hayata sahip olmak için bir hayatı vermeliyim (feda etmeliyim)
Ama eğer cennet reklamı yapıldığı (anlatıldığı) gibiyse
Sonraki yaşamımda üç misli bir genişletme(!) istiyorum
Cennette yat

[2. Verse: Lil Wayne]
Yetenek Tanrı vergisi, minnettar ol
Şöhret doğuştan gelmiyor, mütevazi ol
Ve kibrin kimseye ihtiyacı olmaz(!), dikkatli kullan
Kendi yolunda kal, koltukta kemerler bağlı
Ve bazen müzik olmadığında
Çalarız kendi kornalarımızı, ram-bam-bam-bam
Geleceği karnında taşıyan kadın
Ve doğdu Tunechi, ""dan-dan-dan-dan-dan""(!)
Ona geri dönüş deme
Karanlıktı, şimdi döndü güneş
Bana sert vurdun, ama ardından yumrukladım
Tekerlekler kopup gitti, sürdüm jant üzerinde
Bu intihar mı yoksa yap ya da öl mü?
Daha yeni günler, ve daha mavi gökler
Kendime dedim ki, ''Yalnızca sen ve ben''
Sonrasında rüzgar gelip aklımı başımdan aldı
Tanrı bilir kimin için oradayım
Verdiğim son nefes için
Annem dikkatli olmamı söylüyor
Kafamın içindeki ses bana şaşırtıcı bir cevap veriyor(!)
Fakat kontrolüm üzerinde bir akıl kontrolüm var
Kontrolü kaybettim ama onu bulacağımı biliyordum
Kontrol edemeyeciğim şeyi Tanrı'nın kontröl etmesine izin verdim
Gözyaşlarını kontrol edemem, bırak akıp gitsinler

Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo, new subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs, much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move, two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you? Two middle fingers that's up high to whom it may consume
Kaboom, goddamn, who knew that I am the guru with voodoo that sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man, and see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam, sit back and watch, and do not watch your watch hand, give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man, I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock, but it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land

Go retarded as shit, you go sweet, tangy, I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit

G-code (Can't be broken)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I ain't finna break or fix the brakes, you emulate
I'm laughing in your face, now fix your face, I can't disintegrate
'Cause I facilitate a mil' a day for like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe, want to get away?
No, I'm here to stay, I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today, got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen & Lil Wayne]
You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights they get low
And all of the curtains they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uh)

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne & Thomas Troelsen]
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
Yeah, we bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes

5IvdLxVB8gwwcgnEkXSSW2,Dark Side Of The Moon (feat. Nicki Minaj),"[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted
[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne) / Both]
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him"" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothing, keep resting,""
She say, ""What's missing?""—""How you know something missing?""
He scratched his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,""
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, ""Ooh""

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,""
And if he say yeah, then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me a salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier!""
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,""
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ""Ooh,"" dead emotion (Ooh)

2DnH4XlEkghUdE8ymdVom5,Open Letter,"[Intro]
Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that."

People point at me, say, ""Oh my God""
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet

Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer: ""Don't let me make these bitches famous""
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, ""Can you look this way? Can you look this way?""

Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga—get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin', and my needle broke
Lord, I ain't a broke nigga

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Lil Wayne]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin', you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, ""You are what you smoke""

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga"

Is it true you performed with Willie Nelson at the Country Music Awards?
I don't know, but I know I did perform at this bad ass bitch birthday party recently. She was crazy, stupid thick

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mack in here
Pooh in here
Scoob in here with me
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up
Sittin’ on this money to me feel like a cactus
I’m stickin' to this shit, you would’ve been have hopped yo' ass up

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em, I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)

Nigga, I'm a ass with that semi; call me semicolon
Yeah I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
They kick the door and kill yo’ ass and leave the children snorin'
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, make me feel important

I'm so lifted, I'm so lifted
I wrote my will in hieroglyphics (In hieroglyphics)
Weezy, where you been? The people miss you
Crickets
I got hittas and they not kidders, that's my niggas
You got niggas but they not hittas, they got jitters
They get hit up, I'm placin' figures on your niggas
Takin' bidders, yo' bae, yo' niggas, don't make a difference
I got shooters, on pharmaceuticals​, they armed and brutal
Warn intruders, 'cause we don't doodle, we draw conclusions
I got sprayers, all type of sprayers, we gon' need Google
I got paper, on top of paper, we gon' need rulers
I'm effective, been doin' numbers since Roman numerals
Strong as sumo, we armed as usual, my hittas hungry
Charleston Chew you, bazookas chew you, just like Bazookas
Don't confuse 'em, we only hittas, y'all only humans
Don't get hit up, woadie (Hit up, woadie, hit up, woadie)
'Cause I got hittas woadie

Smoke one, ready to po' one, tote one, scared of no one
You never know when your close ones is a pussy 'til your nose run
Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happiest goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like ""let's play,"" lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm
Rum-bum-bum-bum-bum, if they come for 'em, I tell 'em

[Chorus]
God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me

[Verse 2]
Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?
Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras
Extra ready for my presents, extra sexy but she selfish
Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelmin'
Talkin' money over salmon in Italian in Australia
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, comin' from what's comin' at ya
I come from where they come at ya, in a way you can't come back from
I attack from every crack, while you been chillin', I been active
I been still inside the action, you been actin'
I been buildin', you been blabbin', you been bickerin', I been blackin'
I been sippin' like the Dracula, I been feelin' like Galactus
Got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry
If you don't know I'm the answer, you should kill who you been askin'

[Chorus]
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef

Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well, it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died

It's written all over my face
Tattoos that can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks"
4E3qImtJzRqLt8ZZyLceOE,Perfect Strangers,"[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 1]
Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, ""Why you leave your shit here?""
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 2]
I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, ""Pray""
She say, ""I need a day"", I said, ""I need a bae""
She said, ""Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way""
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, ""Let go my arm!""
She said...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore​
Talking to the man in her mirror
I've been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
And she say, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
She say, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's what's fucked up

[Outro]
She say we don't make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, now it's painless
We actin' like strangers
Like we don't know who we are anymore
Perfect strangers"

This beat here is the realest part
(Baby J)
Sometimes you get vulnerable for
(Tequila shots)
Romance and love
Is it true?
You can't be doing no lying

[Chorus]
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere

[Verse]
Homie said ""go get the 'Rari""
I'ma get the yorki tomorrow
I get a yacht master, you get a yacht master
I treat you like you a model
We go to Turks, we can go to Aspen
Or we can go back to Cabo
If you been telling me personally girl look like you hit the lotto
One thing about it, don't lose your composure
Finish pilates and hop out the Rover
63 G-Wagon, I'm gettin' older
You get the full attention from my comrades and all my soldiers
Cartier down to the rocks
I got a key to your box
You got that chinchilla box
Meet me at the dealership box
All that drip drip drop
Make a nigga bands go pop
You get invited on a yacht
We making love on the spot
You throw Phillipe to the sky
Keep it elite for your guy
They can't speak to the pie
Make a nigga reach for the fire
Audemars, mi casa
Hear the hoes goin' bye bye
Can't fuck up my time

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't fuck up my time
You've been on my mind
Your job don't make up a dime to mines
I made you quit when the time was right
Telling me no is like hurting me
Telling me yes brings out the best in me
You can't be doing no lying

[Chorus]
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere

[Bridge]
Glass walls in the room, let 'em watch me make love to you
Passion compassion while I keep in touch with you
Pretty as ever, I thank your momma for blessing me
Joking with your father cause you're part of my embassy
Put you as an opponent, make my ex girl mess with me
That Ferrari Spider, girl fuck all your enemy
Giving your pussy away girl is gon' fuck up my legacy
Maybe it's my intuition, could be jealousy

[Chorus]
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go...
I 'can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go...

[Bridge]
Glass walls in the room, let 'em watch me make love to you
Passion compassion while I keep in touch with you
Pretty as ever, I thank your momma for blessing me
Joking with your father cause you're part of my embassy
Put you as an opponent, make my ex girl mess with me
That Ferrari Spider girl fuck all your enemy
Giving your pussy away girl is gon' fuck up my legacy
Maybe it's my intuition, could be jealousy

[Outro]
Can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go...
I can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go..."

All my niggas still trappin' gotta whip it hard (trap, trap)
