Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
'83 Caddy with the big-square body and the wheels got tucked in
Chewin' on a cigarette, lookin' at me funny, ""What the fuck you smokin'?""
Pop a Tommy collar, and I pop a couple mushies, and I let that shit soak in
Walk into the party, and my neck is on Bugatti, whole bitch got frozen

[Chorus]
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Got them Lucchese boots on my feet
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Punch the gas 'til my leg falls asleep
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) And you know how it goes, ain't it sweet?
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Texas tea (Hah-hah, hah-hah), uh, mm

[Verse 2]
Watch skeleton, baby wanna bone me
Record companies really tryna clone me
Got these motherfuckers singin' karaoke
No one's Ginuwine, but they gon' ride my pony
Show the titties off, everybody notice me
Yeah, I'm very pretty, everybody wanna see
And I'm pretty used to everybody oglin'
Now I got that bitch yodelin' in bed, I do

[Verse 1]
It's been a while since I burned incense
I use my lighter for a pack of twenty
I don't know where the fuck my Bible went
But I'm sure they'll forgive me

[Pre-Chorus]
So please don't burn a hole in me
I-I, I know it seems like they got what you need
No one knows you better than yourself

[Chorus]
So don't worry
You shouldn't spend your money on a dollar store miracle
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know-it-all
So let it go, you'll never know, nothing's wrote in stone
You're your own oraclе, it's just a fuckin' poem
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answеrs even though I'm a know-it-all

[Verse 2]
So many restaurants in Beverly Hills
My favorite dinner comes in packs of twenty-four
I came home through the windowsill
But I'm sure that she'll forgive me

Da-da, dum-dum

Drove by your house and noticed it was overgrown
Your flowers are all dead and I thought you should know
What happened to your green thumb that you were so proud of?
Their bodies were scattered and starving for love

One, one, one was on his deathbed
He told me you left long ago
Oh, no, he said with his last breath
""Wake up, she's not comin' home""

Buy you new flowers to replace what you left

Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex

Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me

Take my own life just to save yours
Drink it all down just to throw it up
Take my own life just to save yours (Just to save yours)
Take my own life just to save yours
I got a reputation that I can't deny
You're the superstar, entertain us (Entertain us)

[Bridge]
Entertain us, but please, don't wake me up
I betrayed us, but us don't give a fuck
Kill myself today, kill it all away
Broken path I made
Please, just stay away

[Verse 1]
I know I fucked up before, but I won't do it again
And I got a lot of things that I wish I would've said
And I'm the same damn fool, and I'm wearin' that hat again
I know I fucked up and I can't make it right

[Verse 2]
Watch yourself, I can't slow down
This is who I am, can't be anyonе else, so
Don't let mе go, save yourself
Just save yourself, just save yourself
I was born to raise hell, I was born to take pills
I was born to chase mills, I was born to cave in
I was born to fuck hoes, I was born to fuck up
I was born, what a shame

Cut my thumb up
Count my check, count my check
Let me choke on my cigarettes, cigarettes
Cut my thumb up
Count my check, count my check
Let me choke on my cigarettes and heavy debt22Embed"

Couldn't fall asleep all night
I tried with all my might
I thought I knew what you want
It isn't all that nice
But I guess it will suffice
It's hard to know what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
Could you be?
A little less sour, we're rottin' by the hour
And my heart's rotten too
In every film I watch, I'm on the side of the bad guy
So turn around and show me that I'm better

[Chorus]
Some people got an apple, some people got a tangerine
Look around and all I see is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told
I guess I'm just shit outta luck, growing a lemon tree
I'm gonna burn it down, and grow me somethin' bettеr
Hey-ah, hey-ah

[Verse 2]
Blood on my hands, I'm on the fеnce, I double down
A swing and a miss, a kick in the ribs, in trouble now
Came from the dirt, back in the ground, when I die
But I'ma survive, I got my ways
Oh, oh
