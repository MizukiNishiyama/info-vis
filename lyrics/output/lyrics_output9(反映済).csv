1632iucJ0H2wpzj0byUQau,I'm Gone,"114 ContributorsI’m Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back
[Chorus]
Cause I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

[Verse 2]
So what now? (So what now?)
Let's get down—let's get drowned, on this vision
My division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'ma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say ""what's your motivation?""
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy, fuck a vacation
We do this for love, not no validation

Wanna get it like this
(I think so) when I'm driving
(I drink slow) when I'm vibing
(You never know, know, know, know) (Lets go!)
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want it—but fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Grip the mic and I go (Whoo!)
Fuck around with this flow (I know)
[Pre-Chorus]

Yeah, uh (Sinatra), yeah

[Verse 1]
Livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug
Baseheads comin' through, lookin' for the plug, now (Logic)
Born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night, it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Wakin' up, scared for my life, never had the heat
Just a knife, when the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you it's a wrap, finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop
'Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

[Verse 2]
Livin' life like this
Hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it, I'ma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about
What I pray about, check it, uh, yeah
Got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick, I could buy a house
If they find the key, they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck
Take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck
[Verse 3]
Get down and lay down
Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given
Anybody that's ridin' with me, I'm ridin' with 'em
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em and hit 'em with the venom
Ain't no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life

I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna be famous?

Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?

Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)
Uh, death and taxes that’s all we given
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'
You could make it work, but that still ain't driven
Give a lot, but that still ain't givin'
Livin' life like this ain’t real though
Every night like this, I feel so
Dead wrong, collision is
Head-on, my vision is

Livin' good, I've been livin' good

In the whip, every day with Nikki, she be riding with me (Yeah)
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties (Yeah)

We've been at it way before the fame, psych

Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it (Yeah-yeah)
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit (Yeah-yeah)
No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this (Nah, nah)
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do (If you 'bout it)

Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going, that's why I be flowin'

Bruh, yo (Nah sayin'? It was somethin' that-)
Guess who I met last night, man
You know your land-, land chick? The fuck (Woo)
Oh, yeah, man (Ayy dog, I don't know, man)
Now that chick bad last night (God-damn-, fat ass), bruh
She just run up on me like, ""Yo"" (What?)
Nah mean? We talkin' and shit- (Crazy)
We gotta-we gotta stay- (Blap-blap!)
Oh, we heard man
It was cool, opp (For sure), you know, got crazy, so I had to let 'em out
(Yeah, faggot-)
Crazy thing that I heard, the homie say he ran around the corner from here
(Is that right?) Right around the corner, nah mean? (Boy, wait-wait-wait)
(Right around the corner?) Nah mean? (It's on, it's on!)
Sort that new life, he should look out (I'm gon' kill a nigga tonight)
Okay (I'm like-) (I mean if-) (Shit)
If somethin' go down, man, we ready, man, ain't-
(Nobody-nobody) and we ready, the whole hood ready (This car creeping)
(Looks brazy-) damn, oh shit!- (Oh, shit!)
Go, go, go-! (In the roof!) go-!
[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin'
And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion
I'd rather not have this discussion
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
Where my mind, don’t know now
But I know where it was
I need Nikki, where is Nikki?
Baby girl, please come and get me
Now I’m old and shit is trippy, but I know that God is with me
This that baby mama drama
Give a fuck about a man, I know I'ma
Be there for my son, talking with my sister, it begun
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check, check
Won’t ever bounce like my daddy did
But I’m glad he did 'cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8, grab a plate
Food for thought, gravitate
Food stamps, Social Services tryna take me away
My mama locked up, I pray to God that I see her today
Maybe not, maybe so; West Deer Park, that’s all I know
Just me and my homies, people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way (Around my way)
Living day by day (Living day by day)
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs
Five-O with them K-9's
Manhunt when it's game time
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I’m running from the police
Don’t know how, but I got away
Selling weed to my homies
And a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school
'Cause my homie told me to
What to do, what would you?
When will I lose my anonymity
And become one with the enemy?
Tell me, would I be the enemy?
Feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe

[Verse 2]
I guess maybe I was thinking things would be different now
'Cause when I wake up, my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes?
I wish I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen? Maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know—but tell me why, uh
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons?
Maybe not—All I know is this life I live
I can’t live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV, let it wash my brain
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain
Hello children, how was school?
It was good, how 'bout you?
I love you (I love you, son), I love mama too
Are you ready for dinner?
I’m able to set the table
'Til I snap out the fable when that TV turn off
And I realize I’m back in hell

Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes
Everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it, uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success so you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it
But right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude
I look out the window like Goddamn, that's what I really do
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain
If I look back on it I would do it all over again
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Crazy, racist, white bitch looking at us
Like, ""Who are these niggas?""
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam

Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own
These thoughts inside my mind be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm just not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)
Nikki baby, I love you but now I gotta go
'Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)
Tell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God that's all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as a young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)
Nothing can replace you (Replace you)
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta
But lately, I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)

Work so fucking much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (I'm lovin' it!)
People calling me, askin' me for money, man (Uh)
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothin' at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard
Uh, but it's hard

[Verse 2]
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm livin' divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wonderin', ""How so?""
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
""Can I do it like you do it?"" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury
[Chorus]
Work so fuckin' much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone

(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is yo' sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
Uh, I’m sorry for callin' and bawlin', I’m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure
[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't—you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me
[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya. Hm-hm, I love you, son, bye482Embed"

It's the type of shit that they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long-term
But Def Jam said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and B-I-G
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant to me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again 'cause I love this shit
Write it down and they publish it
I went five years without a publicist
'Cause the word of mouth, they in love with this
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming
Went away a while but I've been fiending
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal
Been at it way before the deal
Now the music got mass appeal
My main girl got ass appeal
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing
Little fish, that went mainstream
Now I'm big as fuck
My whole city, they know what's up
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit
I don't give a fuck
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt
If I'm talking business, I might erupt
If you're at the show, put your lighter up
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it
Outsiders, I could do without it
I crept in, got slept on
Sold out shows, no one knew about it
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it
Your cosign, I could do without it

Okay, last verse, I gotta make it count
Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I'd have to pause
And I can't afford to just waste the bars
Every day, boy, I thank the Lord
I got a lot of problems but could have more
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less
I been hungry like Budapest
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck
I just know I'm blessed
Love life even though I'm stressed
This business boy, I swear a test
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check
I'll send Chris to go cut they neck
I love the building, no disrespect
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist
I'ma intercept, It's my time
Put half a mil' of my own money in this album
That's my dime; no rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine, from the basement to the stadium
From the Roxy to Palladium
I've been there and I've done that; yes, I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor
Half-naked playing Connect Four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind
And then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like, ""Go 'head""
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme, so I gotta go
It's Logic, the one nobody would vouch for
How's that shit for an outro?

That's royalty, like the homie Gambino
He know we be in the casino, lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito
Whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep slow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though, uh
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with a sawed-off
Blowin' up like a Molotov
This is war, everybody, ain't no reason I'ma call it off

They gotta be demons, I'm blessed every day
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got Champagne problems, and I order more
My wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician (Good, yeah)
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician (Good)

Yeah, ayy

[Verse]
I got rent, I got bills, but I want a record deal
Don't wanna give up on my dreams 'cause I know I got skills
People sayin' I won't make it, sometimes that's how it feels
Dreams and ambitions of makin' millions from record deals
Emotions, I let it spill, I'm goin' in for the kill
Give 'em my everything still, I hope you feel me for real
Just me and all my homies, we want it now more than ever
Destined to work a nine-to-five, man, fuck all that, whatever
I want this life forever
I wanna make it out my hood, I wanna do shit better
I got nothin' to my namе, not even no GED
But I don't wanna be somе has-been, lookin' back at forty-three
Wonderin' who he could be if he had the guts to take the leap
That's why I'm here to take the beat
And not repeat the cycle of people who never lived their dreams
I was destined a life of nothin', my parents both fiends
My name is Logic, I wrote this record at nineteen
And now at thirty-one, I read pages from my old rhyme book
Thinkin' 'bout the time that it took to get here
See it clear like Visine, me and my regime made it by any means
Used to eat at Denny's, now it's Nobu, hella clean
Relieve the pain like ketamine, relive the pain and let 'em in
Started as a freshman, now Logic a veteran
Thinkin' 'bout the time it took to get here
I signed a deal and made the mills, can finally afford to pay the bills
This world is cold as fuck like I'm from the 'Ville
Let that last line chill, everything I ever wanted, now I got it
Fuck a subject, school, I dropped it, grabbed a gat and cocked it
Me and my homies in the lab, dope shit, what we concocted
Yo, I been to hell and back, motherfuck a platinum plaque

Goddamn, goddamn, conversations with legends
Crazy how one day yo' idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus, money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe than think down and leave us
The baby cryin'
Crack cookin' where my sister be fryin' soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him, I'll kill him
I'll motherfuckin' kill him, I said, I really want to kill him—but I can't
'Cause if I do, po-po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it? I grip the mic and then kill it—okay, I'm gone
As memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin', sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little Bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the sto'
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my do'
Can't take no mo', mama on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I'm from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin' with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like ""Thriller""
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa

See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersin' these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number one—I better be
Bitch, I said, ""I bet I be.""
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me, how is they gon' remember me?
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?
And the fans say they love you, but they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry 'bout bitches and gettin' blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference: I'm stronger and better from when I begun
So when people that never knew me, they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged, I just stop (I just stop)
And do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions, that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal

Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that

I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this

Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug
Baseheads comin' through, lookin' for the plug, now (Logic)
Born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night, it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Wakin' up, scared for my life, never had the heat
Just a knife, when the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you it's a wrap, finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop
'Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop

But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block

If they find the key, they might lock me up

Give a fuck about a man, I know I'ma
Be there for my son, talking with my sister, it begun
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check, check
Won’t ever bounce like my daddy did
But I’m glad he did 'cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8, grab a plate
Food for thought, gravitate
Food stamps, Social Services tryna take me away
My mama locked up, I pray to God that I see her today
Maybe not, maybe so; West Deer Park, that’s all I know
Just me and my homies, people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way (Around my way)
Living day by day (Living day by day)

They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I’m running from the police
Don’t know how, but I got away
Selling weed to my homies
And a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school
'Cause my homie told me to
What to do, what would you?
When will I lose my anonymity
And become one with the enemy?
Tell me, would I be the enemy?
Feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe

Bobby, what are you thinking?
What are you dreaming about?
Bobby, what’s inside?
What are you thinking right now?
What are you thinking?
Go to sleep

[Verse 2]
I guess maybe I was thinking things would be different now
'Cause when I wake up, my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes?
I wish I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen? Maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know—but tell me why, uh
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons?
Maybe not—All I know is this life I live
I can’t live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV, let it wash my brain
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain
Hello children, how was school?
It was good, how 'bout you?
I love you (I love you, son), I love mama too
Are you ready for dinner?
I’m able to set the table
'Til I snap out the fable when that TV turn off
And I realize I’m back in hell

Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes
Everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it, uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success so you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it
But right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude
I look out the window like Goddamn, that's what I really do
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain
If I look back on it I would do it all over again
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Crazy, racist, white bitch looking at us
Like, ""Who are these niggas?""
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam
Oh my God, this is my jam
""May-December"" by Mos Def
In my headphones, that's the man

[Chorus]
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own
These thoughts inside my mind be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

I can't believe you don't like Tarantino
Ugh, I don't like him because, like—when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie—

What?!—I didn't, I don't know—
Oh my God! Have you seen 'Pulp Fiction'?
Yeah, but I don't really remember it
What you talking about? Have you seen uh... this is funny cause we're on a train... have you seen—fuck! What's his name? The guy from the movie, in the place, on the thing?
On the train? With the scenery?

I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm just not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)
Nikki baby, I love you but now I gotta go
'Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)
Tell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God that's all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as a young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)
Nothing can replace you (Replace you)
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta

Work so fucking much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (I'm lovin' it!)
People calling me, askin' me for money, man (Uh)
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothin' at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?

God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm livin' divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wonderin', ""How so?""
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
""Can I do it like you do it?"" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is yo' sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
Uh, I’m sorry for callin' and bawlin', I’m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure

Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't—you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me
[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too.

It's the type of shit that they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long-term
But Def Jam said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and B-I-G
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant to me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again 'cause I love this shit
Write it down and they publish it
I went five years without a publicist
'Cause the word of mouth, they in love with this
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming
Went away a while but I've been fiending
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal
Been at it way before the deal
Now the music got mass appeal
My main girl got ass appeal
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing
Little fish, that went mainstream
Now I'm big as fuck
My whole city, they know what's up
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit
I don't give a fuck
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt
If I'm talking business, I might erupt
If you're at the show, put your lighter up
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it
Outsiders, I could do without it
I crept in, got slept on
Sold out shows, no one knew about it
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it

Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I'd have to pause
And I can't afford to just waste the bars
Every day, boy, I thank the Lord
I got a lot of problems but could have more
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less
I been hungry like Budapest
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck
I just know I'm blessed
Love life even though I'm stressed
This business boy, I swear a test
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check
I'll send Chris to go cut they neck
I love the building, no disrespect
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist
I'ma intercept, It's my time
Put half a mil' of my own money in this album
That's my dime; no rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine, from the basement to the stadium
From the Roxy to Palladium
I've been there and I've done that; yes, I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor
Half-naked playing Connect Four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind
And then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like, ""Go 'head""
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme, so I gotta go
It's Logic, the one nobody would vouch for
How's that shit for an outro?

We what? (What?) Back to the basics, back to the basement
I love makin' progress you peons not makin'
Bro turn his back on me then push back up on me
I'm not really fazed by his fakeness
I'm cut from a different cloth
Engineered from a different tier type greatness

[Chorus: Big Sean & Ashley Merchant]
Okay, let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, I got it

Shit, ironic (Damn)

You might as well signed you a prenup, then copped you a Fiat (Swerve)
Don't worry—I got properties that you could rent out
I'm not a new artist, brodie—I been out
These hoes wanna end us, these boys think I'm finished
But I turn the tables like Funk Flex in NY
Yeah, it's gon' all come around like a fisheye
And I'ma need all that love back that I dish out
The peace is Jesús—yeah, I had to go Biggie (Oh, God)
Y'all niggas rap like y'all actin' like Shiggy
I'm in a Mecca you boys can't touch down in
They turn a conscious rapper unconscious
They feed these gangsta rappers to piranhas
They take off yo' Cartier, fill it with diamonds
To put on they eyes just to hide all the trauma
I just ain't rhymin' to rhyme, bitch

Yeah
Just been all about expansion
You know they hate when I talk like this

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I got pimpin' in my blood
Got my main girl in the tub, all she wearin' is some suds
I done bossed up to the point that all I care about is love
Turned the family all execs, no such thing as rich enough
Too Real Under Sean's Teachings, acronym for trust
Initials in the sheets, and got my logo in the rug
Built in alarm clock, ain’t got to tell me to get up
When I walk in the arena, I feel like I’m Jerry Buss (Bust it)
And we shut down Coachella, they thought it was Harry Styles
Except the skin same color as a Black and mild
Meditatin' blackin' out, J. Cole, a middle child
But you know I get my fuckin' way, like an only child
Downtown pimpin', city slickin', rockin' crocodile
Yeah, they tryna pipe me down, but you gotta wipe me down
Could tell from my handwriting, I got signature style
I should write a fuckin' book on how to get it off the mile

[Chorus]
They used to look right past me (Swerve)
Niggas can't even catch up to the past me (Swerve)
She just wanna love me down and harass me
They want me to play my role, but you can't typecast me (Bitch)
Yeah, typecast me
Makin' sure my son straight, makin' sure my girl straight
Makin' sure the fam straight, then I can die happy
They want me to play my role, but you can't typecast me (Bitch)

Yeah, multi-million dollar salaries, for all of my legalities
And we comin' black tux when we movin' casually
Could build a damn positive affirmation gallery
Passin' plays to my niggas, so the income is passive
My genre isn't rap anymore, it's under classics (Classics)
Look, I knew back on Griswold
When ain't nobody have my back, 'cause it was against the wall
And Waun got hit with that fed case
And he was livin' through me for that decade, to balance his head space
Man, first thing I think about, boardin' a jet
Is how my mom and dad was flight attendants, that's how they met
No wonder why my head's in the clouds, it makes sense
Every day I wake up, I'm one day closer to death
So what you gon' do with the time you got left?
Ball on these pussies, damn, look at my neck
I used to sell CD's outside of my history class
What a foreshadow that was, when I'm lookin' back
From the blog era, had to get through the tabloids
Just like MJ had to get through the bad boys
My son first Christmas, he finna have mad toys
I prolly get his ass a S-Class if he ask for it
But he gotta learn the hard way, life's a crash course
And stick to the task, while dodgin' the task force (Of course)

They used to look right past me (Swerve)
Niggas can't even catch up to the past me (Swerve)

They used to look right past me
Ain't wanna do right by me
Fuck it, alright by me (Fuck it)
So I couldn't do this and couldn't do that
But niggas can't typecast me

Come and lift me up

[Verse 1: Big Sean & Charlie Wilson]
Funny how niggas tend to believe more than what happened
I mean, really, do we look like Inglorious Bastards? (Come and lift me up)
Lena Waithe told me I was the black Brad Pitt
I wasn't too fond of that title, flatterin' as it is
I mean, really though, that's what you think of my rep?
That's what they sayin' 'bout me, quiet as kept?
Like I just go from one star to another star
Like I'm drawin' out a constellation or
Go from one ho to another, like I'm shootin' par
That ain't me at all
I really had to stop what I was doin' and start retracin' my steps
And had to break some cyclеs
Sometimes you don't always win it as much as you'd like to
But thеy can't see you out here panickin'
You can't expect it to change, doin' the same, that's insanity
They catch me on the Canon, movin' candidly
And even though I'm out the frame, they pan to me
But I'm so on, that I'm well off
I only ever fell back, not fell off
Fuck it, it's just a different cycle (Oh)
Sometimes you gotta go through a different cycle
You might also like[Chorus: Big Sean, Charlie Wilson & Both]
Cycle, cycle
Oh, is that what you think of me, is that what you heard?
That ain't even the half of it, nigga, I'm on a different cycle
Ooh, come and lift me up
I'm sayin' (Oh, yeah)
How about instead of tearin' me down, you— (Come and lift me up)
Yeah, how 'bout that? (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I got trauma that I haven't dealt with
I got feelings that I haven't gelled with
I got a lot of girls that wanna get up and meet
And have a conversation with me, after they melt quick
But I can't do that to my baby, I'm too solid (Mmm-hmm)
I mean, so solid, to the point, huh, that my homeboy is The Rock
Shit, you thrivin' over gossip, you the type to lose faith and stop it
I'm climin' the mountain, even if I can't see the top of it
Livin' the highs, thrivin' the lows
Understand that's a whole different control
I done hit, baby, that's mission control
Ulterior motives that's gettin' exposed
Not enough money to give 'em my soul
I set the standards, you live up to those
Life speakin' through me, it's not morse code
I cut you off, 'cause I'm really that cold
Tryin' to go stone cold on me, but I'm hot
American dollar crashin' out, but I'm not
This that prime time, baby, I'm in that time slot
Comin' to you live, swear these niggas is dyin' to watch
So fuckin' busy, she can't tell if I'm lyin' or not
I just got to get this shit, I'm on a different cycle
[Chorus: Big Sean, Charlie Wilson & Both]
Ooh, come and lift me up
Oh, is that what you think of me, is that what you heard?
That ain't even the half of it, nigga, I'm on a different cycle
How about instead of tearin' me down, you— (Come and lift me up)
Oh, God (How?)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ayy, ayy, I went and bought my Mama a Benz'
And then I bought myself one and she like ""Look, we twins""
Nice watch, baby boy, but watch how you spend
And make sure that it's a write-off, I just wanna see you right off
And before you leave that mansion, make sure you cut the lights off
Mama, I know, like I don't work for every dollar of my own
She know I got the heart of Joe and the mind of Mildred
And the rest of the OG's that's woven all through my soul
In spirit, fuck it, I had to break the cycle

[Bridge: Big Sean & Charlie Wilson]
Break the cycle of us thinkin' we don't have enough, you know?
Livin' in the illusion of scarcity
She never got her Chanel, but I broke the cycle
Yeah, and I had to get her a red one, 'cause she a delta
And she used to be a flight attendant on Delta, for real
I'm a grown man, but I had to break the cycle
Yes, I did, yeah
I said I'm a grown man, break the cycle
[Outro: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson]
Yo, what's up, my brother?
Great to hear from you, man
So a few things, most importantly, uh, that sounds amazing
Your baby boy's nine months old and thriving, I love hearing that
And I'm sure that you're an inspired artist to begin with
Like right out of the gates
But I'm sure holding your baby boy
Gives you a whole new perspective on this new evolution
Of what inspiration means, right?
So I'm sure, man, I'm sure your motivation and inspiration
Is through the roof every time you hold your baby boy
And what's cool is your baby boy at nine months
Is already almost bigger than Kevin Hart
So, so that's really cool, haha
Alright, my brother, love you, man
And I'm so happy for you, man, can't wait to see your baby boy
