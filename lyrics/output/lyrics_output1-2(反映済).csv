Pretty girl, all she ever do is take selfies
So she only fuckin' with a nigga 'cause I'm wealthy
Back when I was broke, I couldn't find no one to help me
Now it ain't a motherfuckin' thing they can tell me (Get up)
Ye got the rhythm, make the ladies go brazy
Dolla got a stroke, make her wanna have my babies
Busy got a baddie on the couch with him right now
If that pussy good, I'ma put her on a flight
On sight, when I see you, it's on sight
When your man ain't lovin' you right, somebody else will
And I might be that somebody else, for real
Tonight, tell him you ain't comin' home tonight
And you won't be alone, no lie
You know I'ma slide, slide, slide (Get up)

Slide in, slide in
Would you ride?
Baby, would you ride with me? (Get up)

She know what I like, got me in a twilight
Headed to the high-rise, cruisin' like Eyes Wide Shut (Get up)
But I slide in it like a drive-by
The industry don't like me, tell them pussy niggas likewise (Get up)
They tried to hit me with the cyanide
Nice try (Get up)
If you play with one of my guys, it's gon' be a homicide twice
We gon' paint the city red, it's tie-dye, ask Ty (Get up)
Addicted to the nightlife, jumpin' off a jet, skydive
Your life a movie, mine a sci-fi (Get up)
Told her friends she a ten, I lied
Really, she in the high fives (Get up)

Steady bussin' on you, now you love me

I hop on the phone, turn the music up, got in my zone
Drunk textin', I should probably sue Patrón
Had to do wrong order to do you right, uh
You gotta go through it order to give advice
It's the price of the litty nights, I know the liquor hittin'
Why when somebody break your heart, it help fix your vision?
If you fall in love with a demon or a diva
Pray your soulmate got a soul when you meet her
The crystal ball couldn't tell me if they'll leave again
Problems too extra large to share with a medium
We fight not for flesh and blood on this level
And devil's advocate is advocatin' for the devil
And love is all drainin', and stop, it's all fadin'
We used to be secretive, but now it's all blatant
It's all just lost, ain't it? Watchin' it all cave in

I don't fuck with dog, but I look out for mom, though
Bro need a spot, I let 'em play the condo
I know that I'm that, but I still play it humble
Said you had my back but you ain't never come through
Told you to go back 'cause I didn't really want you
Beg me to come back, you know I always come through
Tell me where you gon' run to
You tell it your way, I tell mine, but it's only one truth
Damned if I don't, even sometime, even damned if I do
Had somebody knew what we talk about, that shit lame too
All we ever had was the block, bro, we damn near raised each other
Never let 'em break up the gang, we gotta stay together
However I see that they plan it, I'ma play it better
You know that we all that we got, so we gotta stay together
Sayin' ""Free 'em"" ain't doin' nothin', you love 'em, send 'em letters
Know I'm going over the top for you, I'll pay whatever
Ain't no stoppin', I'm all in, you know I gotta get 'em

Fucked up the middle part and mumble the endin'?
It just feels better in my humble opinion
Much more n-words, but humble beginnings
When I act like the n-word, somebody get injured
That's why we stay in court and go to the pen' for it
Before I forget, let me go get a pen for it
Cancel culture, before I get censored
All I really meant for is you to get mentorеd
Before we gеt sentenced, before we get sent for
Remember the sentence, remember repentance
Only God can judge me, GDs and Vice Lords
Over in Danville, Stateville, Taylorville, Menard
Jacksonville, Pontiac, Pinckneyville
We mass targeted, mass marketed
Mass incarceration, mass in police stations
Mass incorporated, fuck Adidas (My soul)

But stay on my Deen, 'cause without it, I'm faithless

They just want what you got and they try
All alone with nobody beside
Sit there and cry, just wishin' you'd die
Know this life is a test, tryna pass it
With my face on the ground in the Masjid
You got questions, then you better ask 'em
'Cause time wait for no one, it comes and it passes
Under pressure, attack on me daily
Love my mama, she tried, couldn't save me
Gave me tools to survive through this crazy
Fear nothing but God, and be good to your lady
Wait on tears and no one understands
It's predestined and God got a plan
One thing I know, he made me a man
He gave me two legs on the ground on to stand
To my wifey, baby, you so fine
Proud to say to the world, yeah, you mine
You stood by me through all the hard times

Count hundreds on the blue side, booty must've grew in size
Seen it from the front side, damn, it must be two-sized (Yeah)
Goddamn it, must be two sides
Forgis on the Double R, I'm floatin' like a cruise line
Bitches wanna fuck me, then trap me, then fuck me over
She cryin' tears in that Maybach and not the Toyota
Once it's over, then she dead to me, give that ho a memorial
Suck my dick for the interview, a headitorial
Put you on a track, have you workin' like I appointed you
Ho, how you gon' go blockin' your blessing when I anointed you?
Beautiful big titty, butt-naked bitches, where you at? Uh
Started off trippin', tell her, ""Pay tuition,"" no congrats, uh
Winin' and dinin', now to take my ratchet ho to Saks, uh
She was too used to Hamburger Helper, chilli mac
And that's facts, you can fact-check it
I'm from the crack era
Redbone bitches, they king me like I'm a black checker
Standin' at the plate, your ho catchin' balls like a back catcher
I bring my pistol when I fuck her 'cause it's all 'bout survival, ho
I'll gut you clean, I bet you fuck with my rivals, though
Put that on everything, a whole stack of bibles, ho
Real niggas like me just don't fall out the sky, you know
So keep vibin', ho
And you know that's facts, you can fact-check it
I'm from the crack era
Where niggas run off and work it, don't bring it back era
Standin' at the plate, your ho catchin' balls like a back catcher

People are funny, they know Kanye's great too
But the way he conducts himself, they hate to believe it
But they can't help it, they know he's great (Right)
Why would— Listen
Shit Kanye say is basically affirmations what people say for success
And it sounds insane because that's what motherfuckers do
But he sounds insane and that's signs— sounds of a leader
No doubt he's got some mental fuckin' issues, most leaders do
The delusional issue, ""I'm a God"""

Could fry you forever, it's a permanent burn
You charging for cookie, that's bang for your buck
If you kissin' on the mouth, you ain't charging enough

Fuckin' on a bitch you never heard of, heard of

That Pope like the leader of the Vatican, he do it again?
Everything I do, they do, guess Yeezy set the trend
And we in this bitch again, time to get rich again (Throw your motherfuckin' hands)
They lookin' like prey, I guess that's why they prayin'
And when you flyin' private, it can't be no delayin'
When I speak my mind, it's gon' be some lawsuits and furniture movin'
I gotta haul through like when you be movin'
I gotta fly to Japan just to bе secluded
They did no damagе, what I give 'em? No chances
Even if they get a chance, here's panic like they know Spanish
How I brand all of these clothes?
How every tantrum I throw make an anthem for hoes?
This my life, not a quote

Fuckin' on a bitch you never heard of, heard of

I'ma take all my baldies to Giorgio Baldis
Throw my dick a party
Your dress code upscale, used to shop at Aldis
I ran up some numbers, now I got what you all need
Give your homegirl the boric acid, save the summer
New abs, she droppin' fast, it's time to come up
Black out
Passin' out and then she wakin' up gorgeous
I'm not racist, it's a preference
And my bitch lookin' like a reference
Don't I make the rules like a referee?
Come get on your knees, shawty, I got needs
She a loud mouth
I need to sign and seal a couple brand new deals
Gotta get this shit off my chest, I got some shit to spill
Passin' out NDAs, nigga, deal with it after
I just fucked the world raw, she need a morning after
And then the morning after
And I quote, ""It's only one GOAT,"" let you have your fun, though
Run the block like Mutombo, you had it on loan
Every day in New Jersey, on my way to New York
I was late to every meeting, in my queen's tunnel
But all the hoes in Hoboken know
If I seent you outside with the open-toes
You might get you a trip to the Poconos
You might have to tell your man a Pinocchio
That was a jokey-joke
That wasn't nowhere near as funny when you brokey-broke
Crying in high school over a high school bitch
And she still in the dark takin' night school, bitch
Look at how we made it like we Mike WiLL, bitch
Wish somebody woulda warned us
When I was fifteen, my soulmate wasn't born yet
African king in a different time
We got multiple wives too, just at different times
Picture this, if every room got a different bitch
Do that make me a po-nigga-mist?
Without the deals, I guarantee I'm still nigga rich
Shit is fuckin' ridiculous"

Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown

Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it

Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, ""What do you love?""
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much

Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals

No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me

Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me

Used to throw up my uncle's spaghetti
Been told to tote since before I was ready
Back when my mama told me that I was challenged
A single Black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse outta debty
I gotta, I gotta put on a rager one time
I swung the powder, went major one time
I know some white people servin' no time
I gotta do it for me, do it for, pray for me
Do it for all the ones dyin'
I wanna do it for all the ones cryin'
I wanna, uh, uh, uh, let's get right, huh"

My soul cries out Hallelujah and I thank God for saving me
I thank God for...

[Chorus]
Here go all your problems again (I thank God)
Three, two, one, you're pinned (I thank God)
Uncle now he back in the pen' (Hallelujah)
Auntie shut down again
Did she finally come to life? (Thank you, Jesus)
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?

[Verse 1]
Don't you wish the night would go numb?
I've been feelin' low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long
I been in the dark for so long
Night is always darkest 'fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark 'fore I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone (Loosen right now, the spirit that wants to run)
Floatin' on a silver lining (In the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining
And my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, ""Get behind me""
And all the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
You know exactly where to find me

[Interlude]
Hallelujah (Thank you, Jesus)
Hallelujah (Yes)
Hallelujah...

[Pre-Chorus]
Did those ideas ever really come to life?
Make it all come to life
Make it all come to life
Prayin' for a change in your life
Well, maybe it's gon' come tonight

[Chorus]
Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back in the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Took your thoughts and penciled 'em in
Should've wrote 'em down in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
And maybe they'll come to life
Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back to the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Thoughts, you had penciled 'em in
Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life

[Verse 2]
You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Brought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free
Floatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining
So when I'm free, I'm free"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, it's too early
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't know want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
How these **** leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coko
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get across and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

[Bridge: Buju Banton]
Now here we are
You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Interlude: Buju Banton]
Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light (Right on)
One last sparkle to follow"

It's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC, uh
Talk to me nicely, don't come at me loud
You had a Benz at sixteen, I could barely afford a Audi
How you gon' try to say sometimes it's not about me?
Man, I don't know what I would do without me

They rented a room, we bought the resort

Time and silence a luxury
Cussin' at your baby mama, guess that's why they call it custody
God got us, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time and space is a luxury
But you came here to show that you still in love with me
Startin' to feel like you ain't been happy for me lately, darlin'
'Member when you used to come around and serenade me, woah
But I guess it's gone different in a different direction lately

Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food
Bad had tools and a bad mood
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said ""You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you""
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid

[Chorus: Kanye West]
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize"

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Now, we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin’ by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I’ve been through, I wish I was dreaming
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus Lord)
I watched so many people leave, I see 'em change by the season
That's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin’ in
I know I madе a promise that I’d never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I’ve been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain’t no love there
You've been down so much, you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousin in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they've been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama's steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
And she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin', then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visit Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great and yonder, the son of man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the jix or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes'll strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shift the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yakub with two pieces of steel
My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Donnie, Ye, what up, ****?
Get that money and **** forget 'em
I ain't need 'em, but my moms is with 'em (Jesus)
Thirty-eight, look how the streets did 'em (Lord)
All these trophies, but where do I sit 'em?
I was born to rock a crown, **** yeah, I knocked it down
Holy water, ****, but out here, we turn to brown (Jesus)
Donnie, if you ain't loyal, you from a different soil (Lord)
Your flame too low for that water to boil
If I wasn't rappin', the calls would stop
You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I popped (Jesus)
**** a car, five houses like, ""Look what I copped"" (Lord)
Devil like, ""Jesus Christ, he gotta be stopped""
I don't say ""What's up?"", you basically blocked
You see it on my hip, just know that it's cocked (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I'm from the bottom, but Lord knows it's better up top, ****

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yeah, viral pictures (Viral), Bible scriptures (Yeah)
One thing 'bout the devil, he's liable to get you (Yeah, Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)
I don't count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs (I know)
Broke down soon as I seen him bring the coffin in
Lord knows, I just really wanna see you walk again (Uh, Jesus)
Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin' (Lord)
They can talk about me all they want, I'ma talk to Him (Uh-huh)
Some **** get shot in they mouth, never talk again (Yuh)
After that, they go and get veneers or the porcelain (Jesus)
We all need Him, is you ready to meet Him? (Lord, ready?)
Doin' dumb ****, but keep tryin' for your freedom
Uh, if you don't die, then you try again (Yeah)
You get your angel wings, then you fly again (Jesus, fly)
Ain't no ""I"" in ""Team"", it's an ""I"" in ""Win"" (Lord, win)
They got they eye on me, I got my eye on Him (What's up?)

[Verse 5: Styles P]
Some fam died, some friends died
I am feeling rage on the inside, where is mine? (Jesus)
Love and hate is a thin line, get two for the tenth time (Lord)
Dyin' on the eleventh, my ****
I'm just down here stuntin' on the seventh, my ****
By the way, is a ghetto up in heaven, my ****? (Jesus)
If it is, keep the chariot revvin', my **** (Lord)
Yeah, that's what my momma be sayin'
And before you go to war, know it's honor in prayin'
There'll be vomit on the toilet after last night (Jesus)
These **** ballin' they move, yeah, they gotta be playin', not the lottery (Lord)
I am in the flower, **** the pottery
Jargon is angelic, you don't get it, then pardon me
Got coke from Jesus, now I'm talkin' to Jesus (Jesus)
Real shallow ****, probably pray for a gray coupe (Lord)
Maybe the Lykan or a mansion out in the Seychelles
Ghost

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
And we done been a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me it kind of feels like, me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
Because the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and it's what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one, my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction, into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated, and he still ain't home
Now I'm an adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)"

So that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

Never let nobody curve me that don't deserve me
Should I really have bought the Burberry last Thursday?
Wear a different color jersey every Thursday
'Posed to meet in Malibu, you postin' pics in Jersey
Is to lay me or play me a bigger flex though?
'Cause you know you'd never live up to my ex though
If we dive, it's the deep end, baby, let's go
I'll be gone by the weekend, baby, XO

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)
I watched so many people leave (Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I madе a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
Even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)
I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tepoztlán, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me, it kinda feels like
Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids
Have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals
For being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
And it is what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man
I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)"
