I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma
""Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,"" asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

[Verse 4: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon

Roman, Roman, stop it, stop it
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
You and this boy Slim Shady
What's going on? They'll lock you away
They'll put you in a jail cell, I promise
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed, run along, let's go, come on
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys"

[Verse 1]
It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's, ""Which world tour should I go on today?""
See, you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money, yeah, I'm Universal

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

[Verse 2]
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches, I could see your halo

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

[Bridge]
It's okay, it's okay
Long as you know, long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best, best, best

[Chorus]
I hear they comin' for me (I hope they comin' for me)
Because the top is lonely ('Cause the top is lonely)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)

Just let them bums blow steam, radiator

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you and gettin' at you
Pickin' up dishes, throwin' 'em at you
Why are you speakin' when no one asked you?

And you say, ""No, you,"" and I say, ""Screw you""
Then you start dressin' and you start leavin'
And I start cryin' and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays

Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B in the league
Yeah, inevitably, but could it be little me?
You was heckling me, now it's monotony winning regularly, yo
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract was signed, but I am the addendum
So-so where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick, bitch, Andy
'Ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'ca-'cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'm the best now
Anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall'
Your game over, bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers ain't ready, they never been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
'Rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire
Where we flyin', they can't find us, all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it, uh
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'ma grab your waist, then I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it, then I'ma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in
Yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in, and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end
I'm blazin', I'm flagrant, I'm crazy, I'm sayin'
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is her fave, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just perf, uh, Prada colored beige
It's obvi we the ish and I'm rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff'
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag lookin' magnif'
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas, I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin', Nicki, what you think?
I got two White Russians, but we also need some drinks

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin' (Feels like I'm blazin')
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'

Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear, sometimes, it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percoce's
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

[Pre-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

Here I am, here I am

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around, I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe (I am)
Then you say I won't survive if I leave (Who I am)
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve (Ah)
I no longer need your attention, at ease

It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?

I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed

Mmm, oh
Mmm
Yo

[Verse 1]
Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

[Verse 2]
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, I tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

[Outro]
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

To that
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

[Verse 1]
He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a do-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
""S"" on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me ""mama, lil' mama,"" I call him ""baby""

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lamb'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha, he was a Samurai
Somehow, I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
""S"" on my chest, let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon
Convict just like Akon
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the jake on

Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

Yo
I could've been had fame
Jump shot with a stupid-ass aim
'Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my cross-over wins the last game
And it's ill, right?
Switched up the flow, but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah, I still might
I'ma just do me when it feel right
Uh, you could bring it any day
Natural bad-ass, NBA
That's my initials, that's why officials
Don't blow the whistle, bang-bang the pistol
A-a-and I'm bossy
Can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn, the flow nasty, coffee
Don't you do like the Pope and cross me

Yeah, this is my last chance (Oh)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I could just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol, but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this
My flow's a crisis, they screamin' high pitch
Uh, gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes
Headed to the top, dot org

[Chorus: Both, Nicki Minaj & Natasha Bedingfield]
Yeah, this is my last chance (This is my last chance)
Last chance (Oh yeah, yeah)
Yeah, this is my last chance (My last chance)

Last chance (Oh)

Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot (Eh, eh, eh, eh)

Only one chance, one bullet in the gun (I'm ready to shoot)

7p2ewixAShLpjDZrnzZK7c,Get Up 10,"[Verse]
Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just tryna chill and make bangers"" (Bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (Stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (Brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (Yeah)
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (Facts)
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (Hands down)
If you got a problem with me, say it now (Say it)
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (Huh?)
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (Skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (Facts)
So if it's all love, show me love then (Huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (Brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (No)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (Yeah)
I started gettin' money, bitches upset (Cash)
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair laid, keep 'em both laced (Laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (Shine)
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (Fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (Fucked up shit)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this (Woo)
I walked into the label, ""Where the check at?"" (""Where the check?"")
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (Where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (Bad ass child, skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (Try that now)
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that ""blap"" sound (Blap!)

[Chorus]
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Yeah, but I get up ten
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (Woo)

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[Chorus]
Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you

Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly, Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you woulda learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though? Trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I coulda did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

[Chorus]
Be careful with me (Mmm)
Do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stopped so abrupt, you started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

[Chorus]
Be careful with me (Mmm)
Do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you losin'?

Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me"

But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life

But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose

Est-ce-que je dois appeler en premier ? Je peux pas décider
Je veux, mais une fille a une fierté
La merde de changement, c'est ce avec quoi je ne peux pas jouer
Je te sens mais tu es dur à contacter
Et tu ne m'as pas contactée depuis un moment
Comme si tu savais pas quel numéro composer
Tu es discret, alors c'est ça, je vais passer l'éponge
Parce qu'un gars va faire seulement ce que tu autorises
T'as appris comment envoyer des messages avec ton nez si ton pouce est cassé
Je m'en fout si on y arrive et je me cale sur ton cul
Je préfère me réveiller avec des appels manques de toi, mec

Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram? Lil' bitch
I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy

How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore ya’ll get the cost?
Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?
All these labels, throwin' deals from left to right
But I ain't givin' in until they get them numbers right
All these people think that this shit happened overnight
All that flexin' they be doin', shit is all a hype
No tolerance for a hatin' bitch talkin' shit
Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm suckin' dick
So when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fuckin' lit
And don't be talkin' all that sorry shit, don't flip the script
I see the lights, I hear the hype, I hit the mic
I kill the show, I get my dough, I catch a flight
I see a hater, I'm runnin' down, it's on sight
I throw my hands, I hit em' left, I hit em' right
They sleepin' on me just because I used to strip
But it's all good 'cause now they wanna get up in my VIP
Blowin' up my phone, sayin' everythin' I touch is lit
Actin' corn and wanna fuck me like they wasn't talkin' shit, whoa
I let 'em live, let the shady motherfuckers live
Give them the price then it's time to show them what it is
Don't got the bat? Well then, what you really tryna pitch?
Don't waste my time, I ain't never been no average bitch
Not to mention, I did my tour and that shit was winnin'
Independent, the headline, award of feelin'
I thank the Lord for every blessing that he has given
I love the fans, they fill me up with that ammunition
I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this
I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office
Corny bitches tryna keep up? Look exhausted
Wave the white flag, girl, you might as well just forfeit
My ex told me I was never gon' be shit
Lookie, lookie now, lookie now, nigga, I'm that bitch
What you thought? Yeah, you really lost, now you kinda sick
But I ain't never need a nigga, I was always on my shit, yeah
I used to stare at magazines on the train
Lookin' at these models like, ""I gotta be this one day""
Fuck around, got myself a name, now I'm gettin' paid
Left the corny bitches in the grave, so they throwin' shade

[Outro]
Oh my gawd, oh my gawd
I don’t know why I gotta prove myself to people that—
That I’m deadass with this shit, like—

You want me to come to your crib and get comfortable
What if I wanna move in and shit?
I will show up on some random shit
Don't let me catch a bitch, you wanna chance that shit?
You should just dead it
I swear to God you gon' regret it
Watch when I start askin' you:
Why the fuck you take so long to answer my message?
The fuck you gon' tell me?
Oh, you with the homies?
Don't even think you can curve me for some other pussy
'Cause it can get ugly
Boy, I be on some other shit
Just lettin' you know wassup
'Cause if I ever find out 'bout that other bitch
Boy, you gon' get that bitch cut

[Pre-Hook 1]
I'm not the one
I don't know why would you try it
Trust me, my nigga, just know I will beat all of them judges
I swear I'm not lyin'
Pussy was good
Pussy was perfect
But watch when I pop all ya tires and key up ya whip
Like, ""I hope it was worth it""

[Hook]
Leave that bitch alone
Leave that bitch alone
You knew that I was crazy
Why the fuck you took her home?
Now I'm goin' through your phone
Seein' all these hoes
You knew that I don't like her
What type of crazy shit you on?

[Verse 2]
What if I tell you I wanna be wifey?
What you gon' tell me, I might be?
Then I'ma want ya password to ya Twitter, ya Facebook
And even ya IG
Boy, it's a wrap
'Cause I got the gat
And I will blow all them bitches that's all in ya DMs
Just don't call me back, nigga
Please don't be dumb
My hair always in a bun
You know what that means, I'll be ready for war
And remember I got a gun
I be on some other shit
Just lettin' you know from now
So when that time come around and I do catch you lackin'
Move outta town

[Pre-Hook 2]
I'm tellin' you
I don't be with all that crying
If I get her or you fuck with motions
I'm gon' light ya girl on fire
Pussy was good
Pussy was perfect
But if I ever pop up on you fuckin' that bitch
Boy, you gon' need a surgeon

[Hook]
Leave that bitch alone
Leave that bitch alone
You knew that I was crazy
Why the fuck you took her home?
Now I'm goin' through your phone
Seein' all these hoes
You knew that I don't like her
What type of crazy shit you on?

[Outro]
Leave that bitch alone"

[Verse 1]
Look, show you bitches how to do this shit
Stand back while I demonstrate
Pussy worth like a million dollars
I think your nigga got expensive taste
I'm not a bum bitch, I'm a boss bitch
You sideline, I'm center stage
I don't even get involved with it
If it don't make me cum or it don't get me paid
If it's not the money then it's ""poof, be gone""
Steal your man with my Doobie on
Whole team full of bad bitches
And that Louis Vuitton our uniform
24 karat my grills, I do what I want
Bitch, fuck how you feel
Fuck a whole check up all on my nails
I pull up in foreign and cut in my wheel, byes, bitch

[Hook]
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'

All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick

Them commas comin' quick

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm not a rider chick, I'm a driver chick
I could come get you instead
I hope all of your homies got money, nigga
'Cause all of my bitches got bread
Look, got a home girl out the west coast
Swear to God, I love that bitch
Ask about us, any club
They gon' tell you we run that shit
I'm like the strip club, Mariah Carey
Dominican, Halle Berry
Hair be laid, bills be paid
Still put bread on my nigga commissary
If I want somethin', it's, ""Whatever, cop it""
Balenciaga, tell 'em check the closet
Heard you fuckin' for that extra change
That's why that pussy got that extra mileage, I be rollin'

[Hook]
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
All my bitches rollin', rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'

Them commas comin' quick

Josh X

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I see the pain in your eyes
And truth is, only the strong survive
And you still here, so from here you only gon' rise
Spread them wings so they can tell you how far you gonna fly
You don't gotta pop them pills
I know just how you feel
I know there's a lot of fake love
But there's love that's actually real
But that can't stop you now
You're already on the battle field
Took everythin' that came your way
Almost at the top of the hill, fly, baby, fly

[Hook: Josh X]
Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Don't be so quick to just give in
If you give up now, how you gon' win?
I know them stressful nights made you and the pills best friends
I know it feels good, but this shit just got to end
I'm countin' on you, boo
Put this peer pressure on you
If I overcame that shit
I know you can make it too
I don't want to see you lose
There's other ways to heal that bruise
I know you can make it to see
What's at the end of the solution, shine, baby, shine

[Hook: Josh X]
Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up

[Bridge: Cardi B]
Don't jump now
I come for you
I'm here for you

[Hook: Josh X]
Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up

No, I don't think they know

They don't like my growth, well fuck ya hoes
Yeah, 'cause all my bitches that be gettin' with me
If I put a fifty, they gon' put a fifty
Every night, ask Sue's rendezvous

I had to go get it on some real shit
If you a real bitch ,you gon' feel this
Every single nigga that came my way
I finesse and juug on some ill shit
So much people think they know my pussy
But no one can say they fucked
Please show me hoe facts
Name-drop, round 'em up
That bum bitch like to run her mouth
I swear to God I'ma lay her out
When I catch you on the side of town
My Guiseppe heels gonna stomp you out

I'ma give you hell, you gon' think I'm Satan

Let's go, I mean come on now, who you tryna flex for?
Why you actin' like I won't leave you down in the ground?
But you knew what it was from the get-go

Get that money then I go flip
Some people think I'm just a dumb bitch
If that was true I wouldn't have shit, yeah
Bronx bitch 'til the day I die
I did my dirt and I ain't gotta lie
You can talk crazy on IG
But when I run up, let them hands fly
I don't fuck around with no fuckin' clowns
Any niggas with me, they fuckin' hounds
Any bitches with me, they fuckin' down
So if you really 'bout it, then pull up now

[Pre-Chorus]
You stuck, bitch, yeah
I know it sucks, bitch, yeah
Pull up, bitch, yeah
