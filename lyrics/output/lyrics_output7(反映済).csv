Southside, Southside on the, Southside on the, hey
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a twelve-car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listened to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one
Savage, I ain't even hatin'""
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
""Savage, I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch, I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on, man, Savage, you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga, my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know, they bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

Knife in my face, .30 on my waist
Real street nigga, and I keep a Dirty 'K
Hit my first lick, and I found 30k
But I blew the shit, bitch, I do this shit
You can go and ask the streets, 'cause they know this shit
I got your bitch blowing dick, like a hookah stick
And I'm still trapping, and I'm still rapping
I'm 21 Savage, you pussy-niggas average

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
You pussy niggas average, y'all niggas so basic
I got AK-47's, I'll give your ass a face lift
Have you dodging bullets, like Neo on The Matrix
Skrrt, skrrt, scrape the bowl like grits
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
I pew, pew, pew, pussy-boy 'til you hit
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew
You been rapping all your life, and you still ain't made a hit
I'm Slaughter Gang Savage, give a fuck about a hit
I grab that AK-47, and I let it hit
Pull up on your block, watch them pussy-niggas dip
You say you 'bout that action, but you pussy-niggas dip
You know if you don't pull up on the ave, you getting dip
I hit that ho for 'bout a hour, then I had to dip
That money keep on calling, saying bring your ass here

Knife in my face, pistol at your temple
Glow, blow, blow, Slaughter Gang drop a nigga
And we snatching chains, and these niggas lame
And these niggas average, they ain't having stain
I got your main bitch with me and she on the dick
Took her to the slaughter house and let her meet the savages
All my niggas having it they really counting cash
Catch a down bag, gang-banging red flag
If you want it you can get it I can show you how to make it
Put your wrists inside the bowl and swirl it in rotation
I got to keep a dirty 'K, my dope it came from Haiti
Plug tried to take me, so you know I had to take it
