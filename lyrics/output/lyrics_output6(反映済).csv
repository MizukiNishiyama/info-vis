3ZxBXDSc82x8tnTN55KQzp,When I Get To Heaven - Remastered,"4 ContributorsCortez vs. A. Ward Lyrics[Round 1: A. Ward]
I remember it like it was yesterday, World Domination 6, fight night
I stood on this same stage in front of Franchise under the lime lights
And put my heart and soul in it
Cause I knew they were givin' me a shot
I told the world I strive to be Christ like
And then like Christ, after day 3 I ascended to the top
Now we here, the main event, cameras out, no excuses
In front of this exact same Canada crowd
A nice jab, ya life flash, the punch damage ya scalp
They lose faith, Bruce Franks, Ooops, you probably should've ran for the House
What else?
I'm more than, a born sinner, I let the Lord enter
It's been a long road and still got a short temper
The core winner, punch when done it hit Cor' center
He get dropped early with the socks now he a rewards member
They hit my inbox hype like, ""'Tez a test""
New killer, old target, this Weapon X
I never rest, facin' these lines got him a Death Note; treble clef
Staff behind me, they pitched Ernesto, let's go
What we speakin' about in the third? Is it my faith?
My race? How I live out in the burbs?
Whatever topic you got, I planned how to come at you
Against ICE you said you ""wanna talk to the future""
Speak up now that he's standin' in front of you
But I don't see this as a favor, I see this as favor
Cause your career is at the road block
You just lost the title match, beat Twork but still gotta beg for a N.O.M.E. spot
I'm the draw here, in this battle it's my bars they gon' watch
And everything I need'll (needle) be stuck in this joint
Y'all gon' see how I'm givin' Cort' his own (Cortisone) shot
Word play...Ward play
Ever since I came to the Six I been a starter, I ain't playin' the bench
Every move calculated, I do it the best, you in distress
Miami Hurricanes, what that gotta do with the rest?
Well your turn over (Turnover) for the Chain and now I got you at my neck
You wishy washy, they only gon' wish he washed me
But this a body, growin' up I had to beat the system, it's Atari
I got the drive, while this cat in the back; Ricky Bobby
I can easily flip to homi's, trigger finger itchin' on me
Unload, reload, switch the laundry
I got a different...
You wishy washy, they only gon' wish he washed me
But this a body, growin' up I had to beat the system, it's Atari
I got the glow without the bling, you don't see any on me
But I can easily flip to homi's, trigger finger itchin' on me
Unload, reload, switch the laundry
I got a different kind of wisdom instilled, the mission Godly
So when I get to ICE the pen sticks to the goal that's Sidney Crosby
I'm nice!
I rap better, back peddle, Cort' you ain't half me
The team better, scheme better, Gully got some athletes
The pen different, Ben Simmons, 'Ganik wanna draft me
First round in the bag, this finna get NASTY!

My last battle was a chain of events
Red jacket with the zippers I'm only here for a Thriller, it's time I wake up the dead
They said the crowd, ""Sleepy"" Hollow thoughts had me takin' off HEAD
Cause I see E (ICE) as the champ, so now it's only right I start takin' off heads
Who we got?
A rap nerd who match words who look calm and deadly
Well [?] add verse cause every aspect I'm adverse
I'm carnage, deadly, target empty
Call, cause to get even, I set the bar, though the odds are heavy
Cause ain't shit we gotta speak about, ask Hollohan, bitch I killed GOD already
Who the fuck we got? A Christian rapper?
What's that about duke?
If I flash back and erase his (racist) past when I blackout too
It reminder you of Hollohan at Blackout 2
Plus you praise a white Jesus, meanin' your religion took the black out too
I got him mapped out smooth
At God speed I've lapped Earth in a Flash
Me, I'm a superhero, I track dirt then kick up dust as I victory lap backwards
It's absurd, you don't know who I am?
Quotables after quotables fam'
You're only here cause, ya price negotiable, you probably only go for a grand
He's the dude in Linkin' Park, now hang it up cause this was suicide over a band
You're dyin' in the ring for rivalin' wit' a king
I'm a Terminator, the targetin' (target in the) eye wit' the beam
First it's Judgement Day then it's Rise Of The Machine
This is practice, still sparkin', I'm a blacksmith
You'll see more tags on his bag than at Sacks Fifth
I'm active, see, the moves are calculated, the tool? Is like an abacus
I be marchin' with the pole (poll) in the streets, I'm an activist
An adjective to describe Aaron and ummm ""average""
Dead, get beat for a second time he's Lazarus
I'm out to kill the alpha the omega, the alpha male
You can't measure this amount of skill on any mountain still
Nigga I'm still sittin' at the top mountain still
Cause I broke it down, bagged it up so I could give the fans every last ounce of real
And you still can't amount, sit still
Shit I was on Facebook last week, let's see if the boy remembers
You know we was all in the Talkback group and there was a kid over there trollin' members
He hit up A. Ward, he was like, ""Cortez gon' kill you my nigga"" and he was hype
And out of spite you replied to the troll, ""You said I'm white""
Yikes
Cause that there is the wrong agenda, strong dilemma
He wasn't mad he said I'd kill you, you was mad cause he called you a ""nigga""
My nigga!
Boy it figures, every day I'm online and them trolls be @in' me
All these hidden undertones though it's so disparaging
White boy, your true colors got exposed apparently
And that's why I'm here so I can Trump him with that closed mentality
He wasn't dissin' you, he was showin' love, get it right
He like, ""Nah, nah, nah, don't call 'my nigga, you know I'm white.""
Oh since he called you, ""My nigga"" you was tight
Well that was ignorant, and since he called you a ""nigga"" that he was right
And like I said, I appreciate you reachin' out, but wait til' round three, there's some shit we gotta speak about
[Round 2: A. Ward]
My rebuttal game crazy, he said he killed GOD
Before you did, he had some words for ya last round
We he said, ""Let it be light""
Then, you said you got all these guns, and you really don't look like the Heckler type
To be honest, you look more like the hesitant type
In other words, you real clumsy with the cans like Trevor tonight
They said I couldn't touch Cort' (court) lines, this is suicide, huh?
I'll smoke you and whoever taught you to rap, two can die
Bruh, have you both hooked up oxygen tanks; scuba divers
And I'm prayin' you and ya teacher got a will (wheel) like student drivers
Bro, you lost to Head ICE twice! How's it feel to be dusted?
No, better yet, how does it feel to have the word Cort' (court) in ya name and still not appeal to the judges
The irony, takin' this, you should've had better judgement
Cause I don't drop the ball on cam'; Devin Funchess
Angles, jokes, schemes, setups, punches
And they gon' to work on Cor' (core) like a set of crunches
NYB? Murder Ave? That's where you stand in the yard?
The trap, where everybody got keys like the family car
The bodega, the cociana, you mixin' up the grams in the jar?
What about little Cortez? Does he know what kind of man that you are
The hunger, the consistency, this is how you fortify position
The custody, the weekends, I know you sorta kind of miss him
Ya third round vs Hollohan, yeah you demoralized and dissed him
The hypocrisy, the music you make off money that glorifies addiction
I can't rock wit' that
I'ma let you be you, a foul person
But y'all know that it's King Of The Dot, Bullpen, Smack, he's out searchin'
For a new home, starvin' for attention
Malnourished
It's been four years since Total Slaughter and you still out here couch surfin'?
You see, you can't integrate with this inner greatness
I'm innovative, so watch me Em'barrass this Brooklyn cat, I'll Renegade him
If Cort' take action, it's litigation
You don't intimidate me, my pen amazing
And you ain't up to par Cor' (parkour) I'm flippin' crazy
I'm ready for the darkness, aye 'Ganik, get out yo' phone
This yo' lil' team? Light bars, I got a couple Tay Roc(k)s for these Philistines
Sometimes in life, you got a Trevor that Swaves, say what you really mean
And Ness out with Math, to do what? Get 'em Chilla scheme
But wait, if y'all ain't finished, it's prolly cause I ain't finished yet
What that means is you gotta teach the old folk in a jack then blackout with punches to get 'em stretched
I've been a threat
You should've picked a different sport or somethin', heavy punch
Kevin Dunsh, you ain't missin' Cort' (court) for nothin'
Picture me and you in the pit, boy that'd be a dog fight
This two piece don't come with a large Sprite
So keep ya guard tight
I start winnin' see Math itchin' throw in a hard right
The rules off, all y'all see is a chair fly across Cort' (court) like Bob Knight
Go ahead, spit yo' out of context, white Jesus, blah blah blah multis
Hopefully battlin' me makes you better
Round
[Round 2: Cortez]
I seen you battle out in Cali, you know the one you did between P and A you did ya thing
But this here's ya retirement plan, that's a P&A
You're soft, jelly and made for a bitch; T&A
But if you cross me God bars, I'll carve a T in A
And bring the impact to the ring
Get it? T&A
I mean we know you ain't a killer, you couldn't match wit' DNA
So I guess they think C average after gradin' D and A
But after this performance you gon' have to give C an A
I don't know what y'all see in A cause he only put in work with scrubs, that's a CNA
Wordplay at its best
Who creepin'? You speakin', the tool reachin'
I'm the Abado to sazon I'm too seasoned
I don't like you, why? Cause he pussy
And...cause he pussy, that's two reasons
I'm leavin' ya crew leakin', them bullets spread like germs when the nose blow, it's flu season
I am cut throat, hostile
You are humble, gospel
Cut throat, I be hittin' that bag harder than a Lush One nostril
We drove here with the straps, fuck Canada laws
I brought the steel (steal) overseas like I'm LiAngelo Ball
And that's why you dude's fed
Cause I'm makin' moves, you know with that cuckoo bread
Team Gully, I'm only here to leave you dude's dead
Even you too, I came here with two 2's lead
A cast of battle rappers to get Bodied once I leave everything on YouTube Red
I'm the guy next I'm warning you, try to flex I'm warrin'
My mindset's distorted to divide flesh and tore him
Slice necks and pour 'em
I whip 'em like Pyrex 'til the pie stretch I'm ballin'
Cause I'm workin' with a prize (Pras) like Wyclef and Lauryn
Nigga you second rate, never late, I put a fork in him
Buck 50 I get 'em ate
Now he's cooked with his cheek leftover, oh that's the second plate
Dude's act sketchy so the lead can sketch his face
I wave sticks, then buck it (bucket) in the crowd; collection plate
That was CRAZY
I don't know what kind of match is this
Ya pen was flawed but this is blasphemous
Then tryin' to match men with gods so tell A. men they gon' have to carry a amen, now make amends wit' God
Boy, I thought you was gonna be one of the best
The up and comers, one of the best for sure
And then I seen it, there's no content
When I dissect ya bars, there's no substance, Joe Buddens
Y'all get it, we all see he ain't Complex no more
So like I said, I appreciate you reachin' out
But wait 'til round three cause there's some shit we gotta speak about

[Round 3: A. Ward]
I said it's apparent that you very thirsty, go ahead and drink some more of that water
You think I'm supposed to believe that you got guns over the boarder
When unfortunately we couldn't even 'Gunn over the boarder?
Third round is supposed to be the closer, right?
Well this where it gets so gritty
My brother Kannon told me, ""Always stay strapped up if you ain't walkin' around in ya own city.""
I said, ""Whoa man. Charron scam. They checkin' heat at the door
There's no blickeys, and I don't do gun bars.""
Then realized for the first time ever I got a Shotti and a Krome wit' me
That Shotti is from 7 Mile where bodies drop, they love triggers
After the slug hit ya, you lose and I leave wit' the...

[Shotti P]
Dub nigga!

[A. Ward]
That chrome (Krome) a .44 Magnum, good from a long shot
I got it from...
Aye bro where you from again?

[Krome]
Montreal

[A. Ward]
Montre- I bought the chrome (Krome) at a pawn shop
It's registered in my name, the serial number good, no trail or prints
And like you half the time it stay in the vault, but this head shot outta self defense
Look, you made the boy wonder, why you wanted this free smoke
Two rounds, I done heard God in ya angles, but what about guardian angels? Cause you gon' need both
You told B. Dot, you ""can't eat books for dinner""
Played the street card like some cool guy
Wool eyes, that mask got (mascot) you consumed like school pride
Tell me, if that's the case, then why is it the hunger I had in the classroom made sure that I had full ride?
Now I eat off that and I eat off rap, I got it from the mud
My mother had dinner for five kids to fix, life wasn't sweet
Mental illness had her pullin' pills out and my father's breath always smelled liquor-ish
The difference is, I don't say all that to act better Cort'
And the reason I got faith in God can't just be explained in a battle rap metaphor
I got the same questions as him
Often times I look up at Heaven, puzzled and defeated
I'ma be honest wit' you
Sometimes when I say, ""God is good"", on the inside, even I struggle to believe it
It's transparency, authenticity, it matters to the fans
You keep a drum, I keep it a stack, lets have a battle of the bands
You on the king's turf
Facin' Cort' on this soil, I make him eat dirt
I'm the underdog, I duck a swing first
The right up front, the left behind, I'm 'bout to leave Earth
Flee hurt, his fee just took a hit, that's a cheap verse
Real (reel) lines put the kid in the sky, that how a DreamWorks
I'm outta character, I need church, like a weeks worth
My head not in the right place, it's like a breached birth
I left the pen' lookin' for murder, they freed Surf
I wanna tell you somethin', A. Ward draw A, nah palindrome, reverse
I just get him cracked, then send him back to Smack wrapped in his Al Kapone t-shirt
I'm nice!
I ain't come to get personal wit' you
But I brought enough bars to body you and anybody person that's with you
So tell 'em, ""Fall in line""
And until then, God is good
(All the time!)

[Round 3: Cortez]
That third round was cute, it really wasn't nothin' to stress
The irony, you jump in for him, but last battle you wasn't even gon' jump in for Quest
Now like I said, I appreciate y'all reachin' out but this is round three and there's some shit we gotta speak about
A. Ward is with a group called YTG
Combined the group can't even crack him a million
NuBorn peaked then still couldn't crack through the ceilin'
Bonnie got put on front street versus Ness Lee
Cause apparently she stealin' and what did you do?
Did you hold down ya clique?
Huh? Did you hold 'em down or did you switch to avoid 'em
Did he whine (wine) or break bread? I'm tryin' to figure out what the ministry taught him
I mean you left 'em flat it turned ya back and then you switched to the Horsemen
So you're Peter The Apostle, you denied ya bros, got low once you heard that that chicken was callin'
Hold on, wait one second
Now it's the 4 Horsemen he's wit' huh?
Let me guess, Street Hymns is Arn Anderson?
I mean, I know, who gives a fuck?
Plus he's never been an enforcer in the streets they hem him up
He doesn't even sell tickets, his image is off, he's finished and washed
The fans don't give a shit anymore
So he is Arn Anderson
(Why?)
Cause he never sold out and every time he's in the ring it's the littlest draws (drawers)
Let me guess, who else, who else is in the clique? Saga?
Saga, right? Saga?
He's gotta be Curt Hennig
Always smackin' his gums thinkin' his rap's perfect
Nah, he's Curt Hennig cause he needs to throw in the towel, he dead on this rap circuit
He let Smack down, they don't think that this match worth it
But then he got mad, fuckin' hypocrite, talkin' 'bout Smack jerked him
Nah, nah, nah
And let me talk about Loso, nah, nah I ain't gon' lie that boy is hot
But if y'all tellin' me Loso is Ric Flair, WHOO! That's where the bullshit gotta stop
Cause he's more like Brett ""Hitman"" Hart, not cause he's a sharp shooter wit' the shot
He's Brett Hart cause every move he learnt in the ring he learnt it from his pops
And then there's you
All the potential all the essentials
Ya vision was clear then you left YTG and started dissin' ya peers
Breakin' ya neck for a chance to start snappin' and even cripplin' careers
I mean wait a minute, you ain't a savage threat, you're average best
Left YTG and had me vexed
All this for a chance to rep
So you are Chris Benoit, you willin' to kill off ya own fam' just for a chance to snappin' next (necks)
Team 'Ganik for the win, I had pressure to beat him
But when you use Christianity as ya crutch, boy that's a lesson for heathens
Cause you're a god fearing man, right?
Well that blessin' is misleadin'
Chris Benoit, another dead man who couldn't wrestle his demons
I got a new slogan bitch
Fuck you fakes, corny, y'all keep doin' what ya do
But stay the fuck away from me
It's Brooklyn, all day I keep it trill for that
Toronto, lick a shot for PH, the realness is back1Embed"

Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood
Like everybody from the hood is up to no good ?
You think all the girls around here are trickin'
Up there lookin' like Superchicken
At night I see your light through my bedroom window
But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil
I can't wait till I hear you say
""I'm going down, mayday, mayday."" I'm gonna clown
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me
Y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force, but we don't want ya
Standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher
""So fly like an eagle.""
But don't follow us wherever we go
The shit that I'm saying, make sure it's heard
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird

[Hook]
""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird""
""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird""

[Verse 2]
Now, my homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex
And let me try the fo' next
Now the fo' I was driving was hotter than july
Looked up and didn't see a ribbon in the sky
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
""Calling all cars, I think we've got em.""
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood
I think I drove through every single hood
South Central, Compton and Watts
Long Beach, bust a U, here come the cops
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious
You know that I'm running
Shit, I hear it humming
Fuck, I see it coming
Is it a bird? Yup
Is it a plane? No
I hit me a right on El Segundo
Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala
Let's see if they would folla
Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window
I wish it was my kinfolk
Had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third
'Cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird

""Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back
On. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115
Miles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be
Real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh
Ehrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.""

[Verse 3]
Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him
Could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?
See, I didn't want to gank you
But don't make me bank you, thank you
Tried to get to the hood, and you might guess
That a fool like me done shot Cyrus
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle
Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?""
I bust me a left on Ruthelen. Park
The 735 and I'm bailin
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed
I saw the pigs and the fo' on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face
I closed the blinds cause I didn't wanna catch a case
All that night, I heard the bird circle
While I was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said I could sleep on the couch
By two A.M. I was digging her out
Fuck the ghetto bird
[Pre-Outro]
""Which way is he going now?""
""Ok, now..now he's..he's actually southbound..on a service street
And, uh...Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna have to get my maps out here and figure

Fool, you know how we do it
Westside
Comin' from the Westside
Nothin' but the Westside

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on a tee lee, you don't wanna see a G
Break your ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes  like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Four-hoppin', ass-droppin'
Coupe DeVille, my troupe can kill
Fool, I got skills
So back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Comin' from the Westside, Westside

Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double-parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Who got got and who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob - Planet of da Apes
I'm down with Eiht and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want the bomb  just like George Clinton
S-K-P is down to catch a body
Put on ""Knee Deep,"" we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

You know how we do it

[Verse 3]
Jack be nimble and Jack be quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick
'Cause I'm that fool from South Central
You'll think you stuck yourself  with a number two pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in your ass
With ""More Bounce to the Ounce"" in the dash
Mash up Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great , slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive to keep the four from crashin'
Stashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it
You know how we do it

6YVQ2SiAAwDwMmnqZN4IoF,Cave Bitch,"29 ContributorsCave Bitch Lyrics[Intro: Dr. Khalid Muhammad]
Give me a black goddess, sister, I can't resist her. No stringy haired, blonde hair, blue eyed, pale skinned buttermilk complexion. Grafted, recessive, depressive, ironing board backside, straight up and straight down. No frills, no thrills, Miss six o'clock, subject to have the itch, mutanoid, caucazoid, white cave bitch...

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Ease back white bitch, I don't play that!
Just because I got on my L.A. hat
""Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots""
Is my jingle, now you want Mandingo
Big, black and handsome
I should hold your devil ass for ransome
Sorta like Patty Hearst, but I'll burst first, bitch!
And you know what's worse?
I'm coming from the land where the choppers roam
So fuck you, bitch, and your Coppertone
Stringy hair, no derrier, frontin' and fakin' with your silicone pair
Do I wanna fuck? Not hardly
That's kinda like Barbie fuckin' Bob Marley
It ain't gonna happen, I keep rappin'
Motherfuck Tennille, but see, I'm the Captain of this ship
And I'm true to the game
Y'all all look the same
Standin' by my backstage door, hopin' I will switch
Spread out, you little cave bitch!

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Why every time we get famous
You wanna play us like Andy and Amos?
The devil sent you to try to tame us
But you can't tame me, with no bitch named Amy
Lookin' for the dark meat
But ho, I ain't tryin' to go out like Barkley
'Cause every time I turn on the TV
I see several brothers with she-devils
Smilin' 'cause you out on a date
But sooner or later, the bitch'll yell ""Rape!""
Soon as daddy found out you a jigaboo
He'll kill like he did Emmitt Till
Yeah, he tried to kick bass
But the bitch probably threw it in his face
Southern Belle ain't nothin' but a trick
Nasty as hell, stanky little cave bitch!

Now, don't think that I hate you
'Cause I won't date you, bitch, I gotta stay true
You can be a fan, but don't expand
And try to get my dick in your hand!
You better run to the minute man
Pale as snow, so act like y'know
'Cause if I slap it, flip it, and rub it like that
Yeah, it gotta be black; plus, yo ass too flat!
I need a butt big enough that can clap
Rat-a-tat-tat! You can't get mine, hoe
I'd rather fuck an albino
At least I know, she's comin' from the Nubian
And not the Ku Klux Klan that you be in
And I don't give a fuck if your family is rich
You're still a little cave bitch!1Embed"

In any country, prison is where society sends it's failures
But in this country, society itself is failing

[Verse 1]
Tadow, how you like me now, I'm in the mix?
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota
Got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal
Dropped out the twelfth
'Cause my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees
Now I slang keys
Infest my hood with crack, cuz I'm the mack
Take a nation of millions to hold me back
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches
Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5
'89s the number, another summer
Police ain't get no dumber
Streets dried up, used to think it would last
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past
They tried to blast me for sellin' a boulder
Now I got my ass in Minnesota
Got my own crew, it's on brand new
Damn, what can I do?

[Chorus]

What the fuck can I do?

Police are tappin' my mobile phone
I'm almost home
Gettin' excited, indicted
Spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest
And everything I own got repossessed
Now take a look at the dust
And I'm happy cuz I only got 36 months
Never picked up a book
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew
And see, what can I do?

No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe
Cuz, they sent in the troops
Even though I got muscle, that ain't my hustle
Takin' niggas' shit in a tussle
No skills to pay the bills
Talkin' about education to battle inflation
No college degree, just a dumb ass G

But don't take a nigga for granted
Cause whether it's a verdict or the L.A. four
You just don't know
That this rapping-ass nigga will change with the weather
And be down for whatever
And I'm down

[Outro]
Creep
And I'm down for whatever
Bump it in your Jeep
Ice Cube - D'voidofpop
And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas
It makes me wanna creep
It makes me wanna creep4Embed"

Every January 16th, it's ""The Dreamer, The Dreamer.""
And all of you say, ""I have a dream; The Dreamer.""
And what did he dream? It stuck him right there
And little black boys, and little white girls
Will one day hold hands together
Shit
Is that where it's at? Is that where it's at now?
Them little blacks hands are yours
You can't hold the black brothers' hands?
But you gonna grow old holdin' crackers' hands
Before you hold each other's hands?
You gonna walk with your enemy
Before you learn to walk with one another?
How sick can you be?
(Enemy)

[Verse 1]
Where you gonna go when the brothers wanna bust a shot
Where you gonna go when I wanna kill bloodclot
Supercat said that the ghetto red hot
Bust a gloc, bust a gloc, devils get shot
Nappy-headed, no-dreded look where ya read it
Buck the devil, buck the devil, look who said it
Listen what I say after 1995 not one death will be alive
God will survive, him protect the civilized
Who really cares if the enemy lives or dies?
Not me, not me
Me never eat from the tree with the apple
I'd rather have a Snapple
Do you know where you're going to
Do you know where you're runnin from
Scared of the sun
I live in the sun
You shrivel up like a raisin
And burn like the blunt that I'm blazin
Ku Klux Klan scared of my nutty beats
Cause them nutty beats equal them bloody sheets
Out number you somethin like 15 to 3
See, don't love your enemy

Enemies, enemy runnin from the G
Enemies, enemy, you're my enemy
Enemies, enemy, when will I see?
Enemies, enemy R.I.P

[Verse 2]
Where you gonna run when God wanna do ya?
J. Edgar Hoover, I wish I woulda knew ya
With the boom ping ping is the ring from the fire
Me not afraid, cause me know Elijah
Goin to the East but straight from the Westside
Swing down sweet chariot and let me ride
Through the fire, through the fire that will please us
I know that Farrakhan is your baby Jesus
Devil don't you know I'm a soldier?
In God's name and the baby claim I'm gonna hold ya
Like Folger's Crystals feds
I'mma pick your ass like Juan Valdez
You don't care if me die from the cracka
You don't care if me have a heart attacka
You don't care if me get car jacka
You don't care cause you're nothing but a cracka
Now it's Judgement Day, and Allah'll never play
""freedom got an AK,"" them Guerilla say
Bobby Seale said, ""please make it rough, bro""
When God give the word, me herd like the buffalo
Through your neighborhood, watch me blast
Tribe of Shabazz, get in that ass
You shoulda took heed of my word and became a friend of me
Now you're just a enemy
[Chorus]
Enemies, enemy runnin from the G
Enemies, enemy, you're my enemy
Enemies, enemy, when will I see?
Enemies, enemy R.I.P

[Verse 3]
Now I change my style up, my style up,bodies pile up
Just to trouble you, throwin out the W
Sent me a subpoena
Cause I kill more crackas then Bosnia, Herze - govina
Each and every day out a siz-tre Chevrolet
With the heavy A to the muthafuckin K
Now you treat me like a germ
Cause your scared of the su - per sperm
Please don't bust til you see, the whites of his eyes
The whites of his skin, the whites of his lies
Nappy head nigga with the bone in his nose
Ya scared I'mma put this bone in your hoes
But I don't wanna, I've been to cona
From the cavebitch with the nasty persona
Hit me with the big black billy club
Cause you white and your ho than a silly nub
Three men in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
And it's really scary, now they're in the military
Sodom and Gomorrah, devil read your Torah
Bible, Holy Qur'an
Once again it's on, got the hollow point teflon
And the brother Ron 2X, so who's next?
(devil)
With Dub C, Brother G
Crazy Toons is a crazy coon ready for the enemy
High off the Hennesy
Hundred ten degree, no it's not Tennesee
West L.A., what the hell can I say?
Niggas wanna play, each and every day
Pass me the pill, a nigga shoot the J
Rougher than the roughest rough muthafucka, had enough muthafucka?
Handcuff this muthafucka with the duct tape, tie it to the bumper
Grab his bitch, dump her, cause nobody wanna hump her
They call me Thumper cause I thump til it hurt
Knock your dick in the dirt, puttin in work
Master Farad Muhammad comin like a comet
When the enemy see em, they all start to vomit
1995, Elijah is alive
Louis Farrakhan, NOI
Bloods and Crips and little ol me
And we all gettin ready for the enemy (Enemy)1Embed"

Listen to the preacher man
But are you talkin' to me?
I can't hear ya with a mouth full of pigs feet
Thy shouldn't eat the swine flesh
Ya body is a mess, but ya blessed
With the Father, Son, Spirit, and the Holy Ghost
But my whole neighborhood is comatose
Lookin' for survival
The devil made you a slave
And he gave you a bible
Four hundered years of gettin' our ass kicked
By so-called Christians and Catholics
But I'mma watch 'em burn in the fire
See, I'm a G, that's why I ain't in ya choir
Cause I see, cause I know
The church ain't nothin' but a fashion show
Get the devil do a one-eighty-seven

[Hook]
And they won't call me a nigga
When I Get To Heaven

[Verse 2]
Your waitin' for the devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast, in sheeps clothin'
But I'm rollin'
With that knowledge of self
Cause Heaven ain't just wealth
So mister preacher
If I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?
White man, please take another look
Cause we couldn't be readin' out the same book
Cause you's a crook, and I'm a brotha
King James had sex with his motha
Is that your edition? Is that your religion?
Black men you gotta make a decision
Cause God is comin' on day number seven

And they won't call me a nigga
When I Get To Heaven

[Verse 3]
The same white man that threw me in the slamma
He bombed a church in Alabama
So if I cocked the hammer God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine
Cause God is a killa from the start
Why you think, Noah had to build his arc
And God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say ""amen"" after each and every prayer
I just stare at the church man
Spendin' more money on the church-van
But Elijah's got a plan
Got the white man screamin', ""Damn, that Farrakhan""
Cause one day these babies'll up rise
Much more than bow ties and bean pies
Kickin' knowledge at the Seven-Eleven

[Hook]
And they won't call me a nigga
When I Get To Heaven

[Outro]
...But when it come to standin' up
We find a convenient excuse, to lay down
Back away from struggle2Embed"
