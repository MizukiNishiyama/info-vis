This a number one champion sound (Yeah)
Yeah, Estelle, we 'bout to get down (Get down)
Who the hottest in the world right now? (Uh)
Just touched down in London town (Uh)
Bet they give me a pound (Uh)
Tell 'em put the money in my hand right now (Yes)
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats

[Chorus: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

[Verse 1: Estelle]
He said, ""Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya""
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy
You might also like[Chorus: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy

[Post-Chorus]
La, la la, la la, eya
La, la la, la la, eya
La, la la, la la, eya
Will you be my American boy? American boy

[Verse 2: Estelle]
Can we get away this weekend? Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping, maybe then we'll go to a café
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneakers lookin' fresh to death, I'm lovin' those Shell Toes
Walkin' that walk, talk that slick talk
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy

[Chorus: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy
Tell 'em wah gwan, blud!
[Verse 3: Kanye West with Estelle]
Who killin' them in the UK?
Everybody gonna say, ""You, K""
Reluctantly, 'cause most of this press don't fuck with me
Estelle once said to me, ""Cool down, down
Don't act a fool now, now.""
I always act a fool oww, oww
Ain't nothing new now, now
He crazy, I know what you thinkin'
Ribena, I know what you're drinkin'
Rap singer, chain blinger
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinkin'
What's your persona about this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow 'cause all my clothes designer? Uh
Dressed smart like a London bloke (Yeah)
Before he speak his suit bespoke (Woop)
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke (Woo)
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
'Cause a lotta wags wanna hear it
And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest
And I know they love it
So to hell with all that rubbish
[Bridge: Estelle]
Would you be my love, my love?
Would you be mine?
Would you be my love, my love?
Would you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love? (Ooh)
Would you be my American boy? American boy

[Chorus: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day (Ooh, someday)
Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay (I wanna see the Bay)
I really want to (You) come kick it with you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You'll be my American boy, American boy (Be my American boy)
Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day (I'd like to go some day)
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA (See LA)
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy

7r2wD5DK8j92wEjOMJRXTI,American Boy - No Rap Version,"87 ContributorsPoet Laureate Infinity Lyrics[Vocal Layer 1: Canibus]
I got bored with 4 beats to the measure
Professor Speech Compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
You'll see I'm not behind them or in front of them, I'm one of them
Started with a 100, the Game spit 3, I said, ""Fuck it
I'ma have to show these niggas something""
Too easy, who'd believe me if I said that it wasn't?
The rhyme is a weapon, I bust it, the Brotherhood got me covered
OP Orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward, sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as A.G.C.R
The rhymes are raw, deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didn't think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport, I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is 'The Greatest Rhyme of All Time' supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy, not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said, ""Nobody benefits, everyone perishes""
I tell them this, they say, ""Here, it's time for your medicine""
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to 44 4's 22 times
I Gave You Power, God stop my heart if I'm lying
You like red or white wine? Let's talk about it I'm buying
Let's talk about the Children of Zion, excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming? I've mastered it certainly, surely
I'll celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder, searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it don't coagulate
The sex magik won't work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on Cloud 9, look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis, a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners, rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics, notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of Germaine Father Author Poor Pauper Pastor, more than a rapper
My body is a human machine, my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour, then a taser, then a laser
Then a maser, then a phaser, then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why? coup de grâce for the coup d'État
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think I've had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off, I promise you we'll just talk
No biting allowed, just bark, don't run, just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought, thought manifests words, actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me, you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
I'm a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself, then how would I be?
If I do not look tell me how will I see?
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still can't recognize myself
I don't need anybody but myself
When I'm rhyming like this I don't need no help
But, thank you for your purchase, these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious, the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy, you wanna be the best, you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield E&D Fields
Chew MCs like I'm eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real
A bunch of fake King Midas' with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
It's no use if you can't use what you got
Buried in a mass grave covered in bones
My cell phone number's placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it, I don't wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens, wide mattress, she's an actress
This is Monster Ball practice, I'm Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I don't care if we're not the same colour, nigga I'm your brother
I don't care what you say nigga, you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind – waves, bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I don't care if I make history, I wanna be a part of Infinity
Look at what your Sun God did to me
I am energy, I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans, more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers, rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live, earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye
Poetically paralyzing, where are you? Are you hiding?
No! I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than zeppelins
How is it so? Tell the people, they need to know
And if you don't think so, you're a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say I'm crazy, I say ""So, tell me something I don't know
Something my psyche profile doesn't show""
I don't have all the answers, I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus? Answer me!
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded, the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit, they don't like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Pole's longest ice strait
Food supply low, they speak of going above ground to find mo'
I cry out, ""No, do not go!
Where the fuck are you going?
400mph wind belts blowing, think for a moment
We got to wait it out, that's what the training's about
We have to survive, that's what Germaine is about""
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies, follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage, battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hop's trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking, water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan, laughing
Tough, pliable, relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I can't rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship that hasn't been made yet
'Cause I haven't been paid yet, not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating, I tried to save them, they wasn't patient
Responsibility entrusted
There's only one way for me to prove that I love it, that's why I'm busting
If you pursue revenge, dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that you've made
Musically still producing, I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureate's my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it, concentrate you can hear it
I've almost perfected this, I'm one word away from excellence
When I find it I'll begin testing it
The phenomenal beast, astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness
I'm 'bout to show you who wildebeest Williams is, you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic, it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes, the minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit, from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the stars to Infinity, listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battlegrinder created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than China's
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
The primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number 1 is capacity, Number 2 is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember, meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Try to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you can't forget
Oprah Winfrey don't like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably don't like black
I don't blame her, she don't understand it's only entertainment
She probably wouldn't feel different if she wasn't famous
She Traded Places  and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist, if not racist with colour?
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion, the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon, not the sigil, this is for real though
I sit down and think, when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God, even I'm stunned
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was Dead, that's not fair
Who I talk to? Go he there, Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically

Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history

[Vocal Layer 2: Canibus]
I procured a small piece of the treasure, collections from a former era
Dating back to forever, the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law, I don't govern them
I summon them, speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet, woodwinds, strings
The conductor brings the drums in, finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance, Hip Hop justice, rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered, liars are denied water, you still alive?
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule, let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary, patrolling the open seas at U-Boat speed
Beneath the Tsunami, where I'm supposed to be
Industrialists, civilians women and children directly

The results were blinding, lyrics, timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding, so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open, a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me, it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously, talked about it purposefully

Unsatisfied, I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say we're divided, I say we're small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me

Swear your allegiance, the tuition is free
To be a mini me version with minor abilities

The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined cause I'm familiar what greed can do
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said, let it be written, let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere

The fish hook stuck in your jaws, the feedback was not positive
Human Hominids fishing for compliments
Started with a nugget, the budget snowballed into something
Above ground running not underground covered
Breath easy, regulate the pace see if they love it
The Poet Laureate puppet with a message from ""THE OTHERS""
The aura describes the forces
I'm too involved to divorce it, my internal compass points me northward
My skull is a submarine hull, calling whales with whale song
Creating basketball size hailstorms
Water World under water war protected by the Jericho wall
With surface permutation of the permafrost
My war birds are grounded, their wings have been burned off
I'm not concerned though, it's only the first lost
Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry
Poet Laureate infinity now you know it's me
Yeti riding a Triceratops with Elephant netting
Attending Black Widow weddings dressing in gossamer webbing
Pretending, experimenting, they call me a heretic
A derelict cherubim seraphim protecting America
Height, weight, eye colour, skeletal structure was designed
I circle my flight instructors in the skies as they fly
22 times, to show them I have plenty new rhymes
Poet Laureate will prove it to you all in due time
Don't be upset with Canibus yet, the kid just want respect
You been a success but what do he get?
Politics and Perjury bring out the worst in me
But I don't take it personally, even though it's hurting me
The key maker turns the key, those observing me keep cursing me
They aren't worthy of a word from me
I spit the truth Rip the mic Rip the booth Rip you too
Rip the Jacker is proof I Ripped through
It drives me insane when a woman wears lace
The current gene structure is 46 pair based
Her heart rumbling and thundering like Captain Nicole Malachowski from an
Airbase, on a clear day
Ok I'm a pervert, It's time to fess up
I might be looking for a leg up, but I won't touch
Closet sadomasochist sexual pacifist
I like to role play but I only play masculine
Victory over injury a victim to misery
The myriad of my metaphors make me a mystical mystery
I'm a giant in the industry just over 5 ft
Even my photo ID don't look like me
[The adverse disparity conflicts with clarity,]
The NASA contractor with a satchel of answers
I passed up the Nobel Peace Prize for my passion
Democracy Rules Everything Around Me, D.R.E.A.M
Another fucking acronym, just what I need
Killing me with phrases that were designed to put me into dazes
As worthless as my junk mail is
""That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die""
The Squid Faced God is difficult to describe
Those of weak heart and mind shouldn't even try
In a town near Kadam and Kakrak Jahlalabad
I pray in a hut constructed from Sago Palm
Astoria Oregon Fisherman Poets got lost
Looking for Paradise, it only exists in the heart
Cause emotion manifests Thought, Thought manifests Words Actions and Reality
But what is attracting me?
The overseer of poetic antiquity
The Victoria and Albert Museum kept them for me
Pythagoras, Dionysus, Loki and Pan
They have enlightened me thru song to understand
The multiplex meshing multiple messages is too much for me
Truly there is too much to see
I'll mix one for you, then one for me
I'll mix some for the street, mix 'til my thumbs bleed
A stationary pulley drawing from a wishing well
The Genie gave me more than three because I listen well
Conflicted and confused but completely compelled
To celebrate my birthday alone in the year 2012
I hope I am not alone, that would be terrible
If I am celebrating then that would be a miracle
In a newly ordered world living in shit
No matter how good or poor your English is
You lazy and you wanna be the best? You crazy!
Poet Laureate is reserved for the name G
E-r-m-a-i-n-e, Will I am, the name that my precious mother gave me
The world came to know me as Sir William
The man of steel with a Smallville build with the illest
Some of my thoughts align with Einstein himself
I wanna know God's thoughts too, the rest are details
Lyrical Fitness is no secret of course but
The secret to creativity is hiding your sources
Preserve the sanctity of the Soldiers in IRAQ
Do not blame them and hold their humanity hostage
Pray for the families that want them home
Pray for the families abroad that have lost their homes
Who have lost their faith, who have lost their hope
Who have lost their point, who have lost their own
Yo! calm the fuck down, I shouldn't have to curse at you
Hydrate as much as possible, drink a lot of juice
Fucking bummer, no armour inside the Hummer
Gotta hug a motherfucking sandbag for cover
Now I'm self employed, still gotta pay taxes
Cashless, bankrupt, ain't got no assets
From the gutter to the gallows no media coverage
Cause I don't want it, that's why I'm rarely seen in public
President Poetry, the popular obedient Pundit
That's right, you can take this job and shove it
I dictate a scribe that causes the court stenographer to die
Brewing hot tea with honey and lime
How is my driving? Run you off the road smiling
1-800-RoadRage, Start dialing
The snake will grow feet and stampede you to your defeat
You are weak, you lied to us all in your speech
Symbiotic indeed, the host bleeds
Parasites attach to feed fulfilling antiquated needs
Rock climbed the slope shaped like a stop sign
In record clock time, Hot Lava lock rhymes rock slide topside
How does one ever really perfect such a craft?
You're obliged by your curiosity to ask
Cubism and Futurism writing amusing lyrics
My opinion of your opinion is you can't be serious
Test driving my principle findings
By designing a new style of rhyming you can take home and try out
A 100 Bars per hour sometimes I doubled the writing secret signature timing
Was the hardest part to figure out
Agonizing, the pain of the migraine biting my brain
And everything inside it I can't explain but I'm trying
I heard this before, I can't remember who said it
We hear from 1000 to 20 thousand cycles per second
Straight out the freak show no pre-show
Limited oxygen when I rhyme fast you breath slow
VFR stands for Visual Flight Rules by the Book
You should know this even though it concern the showbiz
Because when in Rome, walk as a Roman
Obviously you can see you've made the wrong choice
Fraternize but don't do it in the wrong tone of voice
A bad boy with bad toys made from new alloys
Readapted from a crashed asteroid
My shelter is not far, you can borrow what you need
The bunker doors sequestered beneath the tall tumble weeds
After the Matrix, Agent Smith continued his movement
The same bullshit, that humans are major pollutants
Assemble the Gatlin gun, spin it see if it spun
Weapons check correct, I'm done - next one
My rap room is an 8 by 14 underground base
Hyper cube microphone booth in a vacuum of space
Extraterrestrial Isotopic ratios
A broke Scientist in his Lab with no place to go
All these conscious rappers ain't saying nothing
Matter fact they have no constituent function
Mix this record different, you'll hear me call names out
It's played out but there must be alternative routes
The Geneva Protocol Advocates are so sloppy
A human being is not anybody's property
Reading body language in a Zero Gravity environment
Is much easier said than done, if your trying it
Attending the Opera with a Pompous Ego Monster
I can barely take my eyes off her big old knockers
Integrated in an existing clothing ensemble
My Saratoga Suit is Military Garment
The Quarantine Isolation Unit is where I house it
My team and I salvage the work of Dr. Fritz Albert
If the prototype works, there's no telling what I will do
I'll have to get a new Plane a new Pilot and a Crew
Creatively I have never been to this level
First I'll put you in a sideways 8, then a pretzel
Password please have patience verification
I repeat, ""What's Your Character String Verification?""
Infrared spectral observation from the Space Station
Before you take a break, I'll need you to list and name them
Dock the Kliper Craft at the preliminary designation
Tracing the Detection of Submicron Radiation
Do not leave the Orbital Boom Sensor System running
I heard something called nothing that the Cosmonauts were coming
The rhymes are in place, General George Case
And Peter Pace said we had absolutely no time to waste
Next time we meet this whole song will be a new mix
For all the Rippers out there who need a new fix
My father is Jamaican, my mother is British
Raised to be civic, in the household we spoke Yiddish
ELF 100 cps, Elephant Hearing
I'm heading for the clearing, Storm Clouds appearing
On the back of an Elephant with advanced intelligence
Like Nikola Tesla, shit!, damn that's a smart Elephant
Cease fire breach, riot and loot for 3 weeks, don't you see
Broke niggas never promote peace
Suzanne Malveaux will interview the polygamist Mr. Bis
Undisclosed in his home by the cliffs
I rip shit consistent spit persistent
The sickness, spit with conviction, promote lyrical fitness
I'm lost, what version is this?
Mozart with a flowchart putting together parts of an unknown art
But coming from my own heart
Burning a disk, initializing, rhyming and visualizing
Reaching 1000 Bars and climbing
Martial Law Research, an all expense paid trip to the dirt
Several miles deep underneath the Earth
The Boston Visionary Cell designed my new Lab
Paul Laffoley engineered a magnificent draft
Extraordinary men, who meet to review and recommend
I attend the Gubernatorial that never ends, 190
We just got a SASO, we call this one the Black Hole
I'm glad I'm the last to go
Zionism the answer to your uncensored question
Guy de Rothschild and his bloodline brethren
Playing the guitar singing folk songs, speaking my mind
Nobody could really understand the reason I rhyme
Infrared direct hit, target bled, proceed to inject the syringe with meds
That subsequently pinch your leg
You feel like your an inch from being dead
But you alive instead, you're really dead your just living in my head
Fire for effect, smoke out then rest
Give me a wedge formation, roll out like this
I will spare no sin, walk in with a scarecrow grin, looking crazy
Cause that's what you made me
Classified payloads with no frequency safe modes, no safety
And I still made time for the ladies
Ceiling visibility unlimited
A lyricist river fish surrounded by nigga shrimp
I'm a killer pimp
Somebody Hip Hop don't need me
Nigga I grew up in D.C., I love Lil' Weezy, 210
Me and Baby got the same name
We probably got the same blood in our veins, liquid propane
At the top of the Temple Mount Mosque I look at the Sun
I just have a few words for everyone
Everybody bow your heads and say this prayer
From this moment Hip Hop is united everywhere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically

So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her

Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do

Gotta be cool baby, ya know what I'm saying

[Verse 1]
Jump out your car in the middle of the street
Open up your trunk, let the bass beat
Go ahead
Go ahead
You gotta walk up in the club bare-footed
I like that booty, you know where to put it
Go ahead
Go ahead
Now Mama, you look so professional
I'm following you, sweating you
I can't believe I'm doing what I'm doing
What is wrong with my head?
Go ahead
Cuz baby I like how you working it
I'm watching you, you twerking it
I'm trying to get you out of this club
And get you up in my bed
Go ahead

[Hook]

Black car, black rims
Black shirt, black Timbs
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Holy moly, look at her
She got the boots, with the fur
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Now mama, I can see that thong on you, the DJ played the song for you
I'm trying to drive my stick shift... all over them curves
Say word
If you keep playing with my fitted we gone get it, get it, get it
Girl, I represent the Nappy Boy clique, so I know that you heard
Say word

[Verse 3]
Girl, it must be a crime to be as fine as you
You know exactly what I'm trying to do
You see me, I'm trying to keep it jumping
Girl, I got a Chevy with hydraulics and you reminding me of it
Up and down, up and down, girl you know what's happening
Round of applause: keep that booty clapping
Them other girls lacking what you packing
And you got them embarrassed by what you got from your parents
I'm trying to see them shorts, spread apart
I ain't coming up short, Kevin Hart
Now take off
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Take off
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Move your feet, cut a rug
Put your hands up if you're the baddest in the club
Take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Girl I'm tryin get you next to me
But first you gotta let me see that

[Hook]
[Now let me see that booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Go ahead, go ahead
