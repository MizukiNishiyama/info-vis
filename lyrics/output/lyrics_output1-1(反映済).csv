See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior cam–µ with sheepskin
Still remember wh–µn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

[Bridge: The Weeknd & KayCyy]
Oh-oh, I know You won't (I know You won't)
I know You won't (Oh), oh (Oh, yeah)
I know You won't, I know that You look over us (I know)
So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, ""What do you love?""
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons talk on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't159Embed"

My mind smarter, my grind harder (Skrr)
And my car quicker (Skrrt)

They in they feelings, I'm not really feelin' it
And I know some members that gave back they membership

Look, I act like I care, but I don't really care
Now I live in a new buildin' with amenities
I got a new ceilin' with a chimney

Boy, I got on my feet and I made a name
And I made it a necklace, huh
When you from the bottom and you workin' hard
Just to get to the top, then they gotta respect it
If you got a voice, then you gotta project it
If you got a wrong, then you gotta correct it
If you got a name, then you gotta protect it
If you give me shock, then you gotta electric (Woo)
Tryna live a new life, so I got a new plan that I gotta finesse with (Look, yeah)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First, it go viral, then they get digital
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doin' no interview
Mask on my face, you can't see what I'm finna do
Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the lo' and then that's where I send it to
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em ""sorry,"" they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid, kid, kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

[Outro: Kanye West]
Pray for what folks and them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off His list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib

Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't know want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
How these **** leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coko
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get across and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha

But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I‚Äôve been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain‚Äôt no love there
You've been down so much, you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousin in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they've been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama's steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
And she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin', then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus Lord)

Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuƒürul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visit Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great and yonder, the son of man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the jix or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes'll strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shift the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yakub with two pieces of steel
My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, Jos√© Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

Donnie, Ye, what up, ****?
Get that money and **** forget 'em
I ain't need 'em, but my moms is with 'em (Jesus)
Thirty-eight, look how the streets did 'em (Lord)
All these trophies, but where do I sit 'em?
I was born to rock a crown, **** yeah, I knocked it down
Holy water, ****, but out here, we turn to brown (Jesus)
Donnie, if you ain't loyal, you from a different soil (Lord)
Your flame too low for that water to boil
If I wasn't rappin', the calls would stop
You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I popped (Jesus)
**** a car, five houses like, ""Look what I copped"" (Lord)
Devil like, ""Jesus Christ, he gotta be stopped""
I don't say ""What's up?"", you basically blocked
You see it on my hip, just know that it's cocked (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I'm from the bottom, but Lord knows it's better up top, ****

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yeah, viral pictures (Viral), Bible scriptures (Yeah)
One thing 'bout the devil, he's liable to get you (Yeah, Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)
I don't count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs (I know)
Broke down soon as I seen him bring the coffin in
Lord knows, I just really wanna see you walk again (Uh, Jesus)
Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin' (Lord)
They can talk about me all they want, I'ma talk to Him (Uh-huh)
Some **** get shot in they mouth, never talk again (Yuh)
After that, they go and get veneers or the porcelain (Jesus)
We all need Him, is you ready to meet Him? (Lord, ready?)
Doin' dumb ****, but keep tryin' for your freedom
Uh, if you don't die, then you try again (Yeah)
You get your angel wings, then you fly again (Jesus, fly)
Ain't no ""I"" in ""Team"", it's an ""I"" in ""Win"" (Lord, win)
They got they eye on me, I got my eye on Him (What's up?)
[Verse 5: Styles P]
Some fam died, some friends died
I am feeling rage on the inside, where is mine? (Jesus)
Love and hate is a thin line, get two for the tenth time (Lord)
Dyin' on the eleventh, my ****
I'm just down here stuntin' on the seventh, my ****
By the way, is a ghetto up in heaven, my ****? (Jesus)
If it is, keep the chariot revvin', my **** (Lord)
Yeah, that's what my momma be sayin'
And before you go to war, know it's honor in prayin'
There'll be vomit on the toilet after last night (Jesus)
These **** ballin' they move, yeah, they gotta be playin', not the lottery (Lord)
I am in the flower, **** the pottery
Jargon is angelic, you don't get it, then pardon me
Got coke from Jesus, now I'm talkin' to Jesus (Jesus)
Real shallow ****, probably pray for a gray coupe (Lord)
Maybe the Lykan or a mansion out in the Seychelles

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me it kind of feels like, me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
Because the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and it's what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one, my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction, into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated, and he still ain't home
Now I'm an adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)28Embed"

If I hit you with a ""W-Y-D?""
You better not hit me with a ""H-E-Y""
It better be like ""Hiii"" with a bunch of I's
Or ""Heyyy"" with a bunch of Y's
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Never let nobody curve me that don't deserve me
Should I really have bought the Burberry last Thursday?
Wear a different color jersey every Thursday
'Posed to meet in Malibu, you postin' pics in Jersey
Is to lay me or play me a bigger flex though?
'Cause you know you'd never live up to my ex though
If we dive, it's the deep end, baby, let's go
I'll be gone by the weekend, baby, XO

Most insane out-of-body experience

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)
I watched so many people leave (Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's s–µasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I mad–µ a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
Even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)

Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuƒürul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)
I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tepoztl√°n, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, Jos√© Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me, it kinda feels like
Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids
Have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals
For being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
And it is what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man
I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)66Embed"

I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em ""sorry,"" they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me

Heated by the rumors, read into it too much

You need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, it's too early
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't know want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
How these **** leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coko
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get across and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave

By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved

You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there

And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)

And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side

He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)

After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man
I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)66Embed"

If I hit you with a ""W-Y-D?""
You better not hit me with a ""H-E-Y""
It better be like ""Hiii"" with a bunch of I's
Or ""Heyyy"" with a bunch of Y's
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Never let nobody curve me that don't deserve me
Should I really have bought the Burberry last Thursday?
Wear a different color jersey every Thursday
'Posed to meet in Malibu, you postin' pics in Jersey
Is to lay me or play me a bigger flex though?
'Cause you know you'd never live up to my ex though
If we dive, it's the deep end, baby, let's go
I'll be gone by the weekend, baby, XO

Went through stages just to hop on new stages
Open up your eyes, man, they only entertainers
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)

I've been at the top shinin' like a light pole
And I'm just a product of whatever I was raised in
This money sanctified, so I gotta say it again
They said I was mad at the Grammys
But I'm lookin' at my Grammy right now
Pulled up on Ye, and I said, ""They don't understand me""
I just want my dawg to pipe down
'Cause when you really came from the trenches
You was raised in the trenches (Mm)
You feel like you trailblazed for the trenches (Mm)
I hope God can forgive me for the days that I was sinnin' (Mhm)

Stood on my six points, how could I not rise?
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but I'm not five

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Now, we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin‚Äô by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I‚Äôve been through, I wish I was dreaming
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus Lord)
I watched so many people leave, I see 'em change by the season
That's mama's s–µasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin‚Äô in
I know I mad–µ a promise that I‚Äôd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I‚Äôve been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain‚Äôt no love there
You've been down so much, you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousin in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they've been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama's steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
And she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin', then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus Lord)

Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuƒürul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visit Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great and yonder, the son of man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the jix or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes'll strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shift the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yakub with two pieces of steel
My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, Jos√© Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Donnie, Ye, what up, ****?
Get that money and **** forget 'em
I ain't need 'em, but my moms is with 'em (Jesus)
Thirty-eight, look how the streets did 'em (Lord)
All these trophies, but where do I sit 'em?
I was born to rock a crown, **** yeah, I knocked it down
Holy water, ****, but out here, we turn to brown (Jesus)
Donnie, if you ain't loyal, you from a different soil (Lord)
Your flame too low for that water to boil
If I wasn't rappin', the calls would stop
You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I popped (Jesus)
**** a car, five houses like, ""Look what I copped"" (Lord)
Devil like, ""Jesus Christ, he gotta be stopped""
I don't say ""What's up?"", you basically blocked
You see it on my hip, just know that it's cocked (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I'm from the bottom, but Lord knows it's better up top, ****

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yeah, viral pictures (Viral), Bible scriptures (Yeah)
One thing 'bout the devil, he's liable to get you (Yeah, Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)
I don't count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs (I know)
Broke down soon as I seen him bring the coffin in
Lord knows, I just really wanna see you walk again (Uh, Jesus)
Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin' (Lord)
They can talk about me all they want, I'ma talk to Him (Uh-huh)
Some **** get shot in they mouth, never talk again (Yuh)
After that, they go and get veneers or the porcelain (Jesus)
We all need Him, is you ready to meet Him? (Lord, ready?)
Doin' dumb ****, but keep tryin' for your freedom
Uh, if you don't die, then you try again (Yeah)
You get your angel wings, then you fly again (Jesus, fly)
Ain't no ""I"" in ""Team"", it's an ""I"" in ""Win"" (Lord, win)
They got they eye on me, I got my eye on Him (What's up?)
[Verse 5: Styles P]
Some fam died, some friends died
I am feeling rage on the inside, where is mine? (Jesus)
Love and hate is a thin line, get two for the tenth time (Lord)
Dyin' on the eleventh, my ****
I'm just down here stuntin' on the seventh, my ****
By the way, is a ghetto up in heaven, my ****? (Jesus)
If it is, keep the chariot revvin', my **** (Lord)
Yeah, that's what my momma be sayin'
And before you go to war, know it's honor in prayin'
There'll be vomit on the toilet after last night (Jesus)

I am in the flower, **** the pottery

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me it kind of feels like, me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
Because the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and it's what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one, my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction, into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated, and he still ain't home
Now I'm an adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)28Embed"

But the strong start on Sunday

This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?

I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)

Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers
Only halfway read Ephesians
Only if they knew what I knew, uh
I was never new 'til I knew of
True and living God, Yeshua
The true and living God

I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so‚Ä¶
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhm‚Äîmhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' m√©nages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters

You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good He's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about Him
I love Him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body, I love Him so much
Because He's done so much for me
Every morning
Every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there because He...
He's gonna be there for me
Someday, the sky above will open up
And He will reach out His hand and guide me through
Oh, yes, He will
I won't always be crying these tears
I won't always be feeling so blue
Someday, He will open up the door for me
And call my name
Someday, He will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like
No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been, He's always there
With His arms open wide
Accepting me
For who I am
And I love Him so much
I couldn't do it without Him, I wouldn't want to
Oh, I'm crying now
Feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what

La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod‚Äî)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod‚Äî)
Please (Shake that body, party that body)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Um‚Äîwell, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me‚Äîwell, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said, ""Baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy""

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat‚Äîsomethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I 'member Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It just mean, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)
Big, big money (Money, money, money)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker
[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla‚Äî, pla‚Äî, pla‚Äî
[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
Please, no more parties in L.A. (Shake that body, party that body)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh (Shake that body, party that body)
No more parties in L.A. (Los Angeles)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh

Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are
G-G-G-Good work, Charlie

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man, you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man, they would have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man, they would have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, ""Get your money""
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk, they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?!
On the field, I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (You!)
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (You!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (You!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant

Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (You!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (You!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama mama house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (Sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man, it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah, ain't that the truth?

Yeah-yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My wife said I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate, we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, ""How my neck look?""
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego when confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow
[Bridge: Sampha]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Oh, yeah

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi

Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

[Verse 3: Sampha]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truth stay sober
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above
[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you would've thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that, ""Don't touch anything in the store""
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that, ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Refrain: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now

So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait

Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?

And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read, ""No apologies""
The other said, ""Love is cursed by monogamy""
That's something that the pastor don't preach
That's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money, we can't keep
But we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history.

It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness
Squee'‚Äî Squee'‚Äî Squee'‚Äî
(Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?)
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Uh, I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublots
Or the big-face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window, through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snapback, see my cut through the holes, Hov

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell you been?
Niggas talking real reckless, stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I'm 'bout to make 'em tuck they whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, well, I'm 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't seen me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week, I was in my other, other Benz
Throw your diamonds up 'cause we in this bitch another 'gain

Build your fences, we diggin' tunnels
Can't you see we gettin' money up under you?

Can't you see the private jets flying over you?

He'll be nice to everyone wherever we go

So everybody know he love white people
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwinds
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean, even if people dyin' and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don't want him to be hated all the time, judged
Don't be like your daddy that'd never budge
And I'll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to LA

Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
Goddamn, I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent

Uh, bloody murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jay Z]
Paper read, ""Murder, Black-on-Black murder""
Paper read, ""Murder, Black-on-Black murder"" again (Uh)

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing, uh
All-black everything, nigga, you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress load
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, ""Damn, I was just with him after school""
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine Black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Is it genocide?
'Cause I can still hear his mama cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died, uh
Real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21, I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? Uh, what up, cuz? Uh, it's all Black, uh, I love us

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The paper read, ""Murder, Black-on-Black murder""
The paper read, ""Murder, Black-on-Black murder"" again

[Part II: Excellence]
[Intro: Jay Z]
It's a celebration of Black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Huh, yeah, uh
[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new Black elite
They say my Black Card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few Blacks the higher I go, uh
What's up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain't enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yeah, it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for Black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause there ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor

Picture, if you will, that the throne's burning
Rome's burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone, burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead, but I'm sorry, but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So when love is gone 'til blood is drawn
'Cause we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you, squares, the circle got smaller

Going HAM, nigga, me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit

At forty-two, be better than twenty-fours

Far as them sixteens, I'm 23 of it all
Prime time, riding that six-deuce
That 911, I only subtract the roof
I started in '88, got warm in '92
I landed in '96, that's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for C√éROC to give Puff's stock a boost

1auxYwYrFRqZP7t3s7w4um,Ni**as In Paris,"4 ContributorsHot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness
Squee'‚Äî Squee'‚Äî Squee'‚Äî
(Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?)
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Uh, I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublots
Or the big-face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window, through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snapback, see my cut through the holes, Hov

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell you been?
Niggas talking real reckless, stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I'm 'bout to make 'em tuck they whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, well, I'm 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't seen me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week, I was in my other, other Benz
Throw your diamonds up 'cause we in this bitch another 'gain

Build your fences, we diggin' tunnels
Can't you see we gettin' money up under you?

Can't you see the private jets flying over you?

He'll be nice to everyone wherever we go

So everybody know he love white people
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwinds
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean, even if people dyin' and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don't want him to be hated all the time, judged
Don't be like your daddy that'd never budge
And I'll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to LA

Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it
Give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'

But why all the pretty icons always all white?
Put some colored girls in the MoMA

Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
Goddamn, I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent

If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? Uh, what up, cuz? Uh, it's all Black, uh, I love us

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The paper read, ""Murder, Black-on-Black murder""
The paper read, ""Murder, Black-on-Black murder"" again
""Black-on-Black murder"" again
""Black-on-Black murder"" again
[Part II: Excellence]
[Intro: Jay Z]
It's a celebration of Black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Huh, yeah, uh
[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new Black elite
They say my Black Card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few Blacks the higher I go, uh
What's up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain't enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yeah, it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for Black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause there ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours55Embed"

Rome's burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone, burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead, but I'm sorry, but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So when love is gone 'til blood is drawn
'Cause we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you, squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller

Wasn't I a good king?
Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?

Sorry for the night demons that still visit me

But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me

Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault

With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really, I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should m√©nage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster!
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Head home)
I, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding, ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean, goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil', so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fuckin' insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin' not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fuckin' ridiculous

Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove', leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin', I own you all, yuugh

Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous

[Verse 4: CyHi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment, ""Thou shalt not hate, kid""
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Chorus: RZA]
Ayy, yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation, uh
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan, haha
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make-up, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, ""This what you really wanted, huh?""
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Ma$e screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase, so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat, haha
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme,"" not ""Dior, homie""
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?

Put your hands to the constellations

Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping ros√© all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)

Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh

Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On the bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings

You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
[Interlude: Kanye West]
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely

I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing

Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love

[Verse 1]
It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason, I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I'd sacrifice real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
Do you think I'd sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life

It's funny
Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin' for something out there, trying to find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life, to be real?
Not some fa√ßade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say: ""where's my camera?""
For everybody that sees you to say: ""sign an autograph""
For everybody that sees you cryin' that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh

The only one that come out on the tour and screams
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get-got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen up on the TV screen
And when, uh, the Benz was left
And the clothes was left, and the hoes was left

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say, ""When you see clothes, close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe, but ayy

Last week, I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll cleaned up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now, they know they invincible

I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like love to start shit
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis

Damn

Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn (Here we go)
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture-perfect, Beyonc√©
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up? You see how I played a big
Role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

Everything I'm not made me everything I am
[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So, say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

Bum-tu-bum-bum-bum
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
(Here we go) Damn

People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan

I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough, Mr. West, please, no more today

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees,"" and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me""

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes, I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
That he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin

Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""‚Äîgot to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Translate, espa√±ol: ""No way, Jos√©""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
[Bridge]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' 'bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man

Uh, I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later, seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
Throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though, I still speak from my soul
Wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
Came in the game, he made his own lane
All I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, you need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
Father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds, throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
Studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""

Ho! I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment, uh
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‚Äòcause this must be Heaven
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Uh, I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Oh! We gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day we die, we gon' touch the sky

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Now let's take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)
Everybody take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)
Now let's take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)
Now let's take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like, ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now, I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Yeah, 'fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, Lupe, touch the sky
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco & Kanye West]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd (Uh-huh)
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb (Yeah)
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth (Uh)
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touch√©, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge (Yeah)
To come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh
[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Kanye West]
You gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
'Fore the day you die (What?), you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly (What? What? What?)
Yeah, 'til the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Post-Chorus: Both, Kanye West & Lupe Fiasco]
Now everybody throw your hands up
Uh, I'm sky high, say I'm, I'm sky high

When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure, man

Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' a President, look there's hope, man

Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How‚Äôd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin‚Äô
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin‚Äô to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don‚Äôt rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

I got the baller genetics, baby, it's evident
You see a player flicking, now how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit? (Just a lil bit)
I got my custom kings, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green (Now what?)

My cylinder's quiet, like tip-toes

How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel

She was with me before the deal, she tryna be mine

Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
AllƒÅhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things they seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars

Wished I had told, ooh, was the only one
But it's too late (Uh-oh)
It's too late
He's‚ÄÖgone

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Consequence]
You‚ÄÖsweat her, and‚ÄÖI ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You‚ÄÖa big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone

[Chorus 1: Cam'ron, Kanye West, Both]
We striving home (Yeah)
I ride on chrome

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn?
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch, it's your turn""
""Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, I'm at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone
[Chorus 2: Cam'ron, Kanye West, Both]
We striving home (What?)
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?
(Now see 'Quence, come on)

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child's gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, ""How long has this gone on?""
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning, he was gone with my bread
And with that being said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years, doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone
[Interlude: Kanye West]
Make some noise for Consequence, y'all
It's G.O.O.D. Music, baby
Out on these shores

I'ma get a string somethin' for a minute
Make some noise for the strings right now
They've been playing so beautifully, don't you agree?
Don't you agree? The wire strings, that is
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, on, uh-uh-uh, on
Uh-uh, on, uh-uh-uh

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I'm, uh, ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye, step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me, ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
Dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churro
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They say you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You will sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs

Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
AllƒÅhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars‚ÄîI know it

She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' 'round lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money

But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week, he moppin' floors, next week, it's the fries
So stick by his side

And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl

Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me ""K-Rock"" so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back‚Äî back then‚Äî then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had them Lincolns and auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dawg
Fuck all that flirting, I'm tryna get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie""

What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth, relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jammin' on this groove
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie
[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil' bit (Just a lil' bit)
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali Green
My woodgrain oak, I'm riding on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tiptoes
I sold O's, and this, I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow (drive slow)

[Intro: Common & Gil Scott-Heron]
Yeah
I'm on my way home

[Verse: Common]
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game, it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale - Horse""
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it‚Äî

[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again

I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?""
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
""Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?"" But still‚Äì

But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive

Over there they die from what we buy from drugs

Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Post-Chorus: Nas]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line‚Äîshould it be about the hoes or the ice?
Four-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
""What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?
He said, ""Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still""
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke
[Refrain: Tony Williams & Nas]
Bah-dah-bah-bah (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never; it's orientation
Still, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!

[Chorus: Really Doe & Tony Williams]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up, and (Bah-dah-bah-bah)
I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser (Oh, oh, oh, ooh!)
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior (Bah-dah-bah-bah)
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & Nas]
We major? (C'mon, homie, we major)
We major? (C'mon, homie, we major)
We major! (C'mon, homie, we major)
We major!
[Refrain: Tony Williams]
Oh, oh, oh, ooh! Bah-dah-bah-bah
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never; it's orientation
Still, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away!

[Interlude: Kanye West & Tony Williams]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker
I'ma be late, though
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
Yeah
The Roc is definitely in the building
G.O.O.D. Music's definitely in the building, ugh
I gotta say ""What's up"" to Tony Williams
On the vocals!
Sings‚ÄîHe sings quite beautifully, don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Ugh
And Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warryn Campbell on the keys right now
So they asked me:
""Why you call it Late Registration, 'Ye?""
'Cause we takin' these motherfuckers back to school
La, la, la, la-la-la-la la
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along
La la la la la, la-la-la

[Refrain: Tony Williams & Kanye West]
Bah-dah-bah-bah (Oh)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feeling good)
But better late than never; it's orientation (It's orientation)
But we can make it better, throwing all your cares away

[Outro]
We want you to get used to this
Oh, oh, oh, ooh! Bah-dah-bah-bah
Ugh, they can't do what we do, baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh! They can't do what we do, baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh! They can't do what we do, baby

(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school, and
I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi'
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, ""Mommy, I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford""
See, you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what Heaven do
Sent us an angel, and I thank you, Mama

(Hey, Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me, ""Go to school, get your doctorate
Something to fall back on, you could profit with""
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""?
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni
Turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on, Mommy, just dance wit' me
Let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say ""Hey,"" y'all say, ""Mama""
Now everybody answer me, come on
[Chorus]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do

I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)

[Break]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second they get up, you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let your friends know (Hey, Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag', whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say

[Outro]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
You know I love you so, and
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go, our love is true

[Intro: Otis Redding and Kanye West]
Wished I had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh)
But it's too late
It's too late
He's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!

[Hook 1: Kanye West and Cam'ron]
Gone
We striving home
Gone
I ride on chrome

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch, it's your turn""
""Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top where dude belong
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla troop
Oh, my chinchilla blue, blue, you ever dealt with a dealer
Well, here's the deal, ma, we going to the dealer, woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you, poof!
Poof, be gone, damn, tough luck, dag (Dag)
Niggas still doing puff-puff-pass (Puff, pass)
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched-up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine, stay, you got the grind, hey
Came back, read what the sign say (Too late, he's gone)
Yes, I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah, you church, boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain't even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, chyeah
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now
[Hook 3: Cam'ron]
We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking ""Cons, how long has this gone on?""
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning, he was gone with my bread
And with that being said, I had gone on my instincts
And goin' to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone
[Break: Kanye West]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone""83Embed"

Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Please stop your crying (Stop your cryin', baby)

[Chorus]
I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

[Refrain]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Please stop your crying (Stop your cryin', baby)

[Verse 1]
Stop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in
Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you, Mom
Yeah, yeah, I don't wan' be broke when I'm thirty-one
They said the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West
There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh

You know when you be late, you miss all the lights
That's right (That's right), that's right (That's right)
And when you get back, she gon' start up a fight
That night (That night), that night
Baby, it's too late for that, lately, I've been takin' it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional, like them Eskimos
What would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Hmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes
Five hours later? ""I'll be there in five minutes,"" go 'head, ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah
[Outro]
'Cause I'll be late for that
'Cause I'll be late for that
'Cause I'll be late for that

If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man‚Äîman, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer, they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin', man, your ass is grown

This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55

We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas‚Äî

We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
You tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
You tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou'
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou'
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‚ÄòCause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz

Yeah, I stole‚Äînever got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
""Let's put him all in the front of the store""
So I'm on break
Next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit; y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down

[Verse 2: Kanye West, Sumeke Rainey & Talib Kweli]
Now who the hell is this
Emailing me at 11:26
Telling me that she thirty-six, twenty-six plus double-d?
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now, she just lampin', chillin' on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late, mami
Your screen saver say Tweet, so you got to call me
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
You mean Talib? Lyrics stick to your rib (I mean)
That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib (I mean)
You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?
Yo, Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high (Yeah), ow
[Verse 3: Talib Kweli & Common]
I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well, okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
Her sister the bomb, but she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a OkayPlayer-hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (Keep 'em high)
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet (No)
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the Bubba Kush and her sister could get a hit of it, yeah (Yo, yo)

[Verse 4: Common]
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote
Control, rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show called ""Soul Survivor""
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a mad rapper
Just a MC with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, MCs retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher, then
[Chorus: Kanye West & Common]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands

So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach

Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick

Henny make girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me, miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's

Always said if I rapped, I'd say somethin' significant
But now, I'm rapping 'bout money, hoes, and rims again

Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because
She my caddy 'cause she grab my golf balls in the club
And I'm still acting calm than a muh'

Two words: Freeway; two letters: A-R

Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through your car, my God
Two words: no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot, Jay sent for his dogs to brawl
Forget your squad, better 'fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words: ""Send for the law,"" ugh
Two words: Freeway, slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in your artist, leave with his broad

Yo, G, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Post-Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the‚Ä¶
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man

I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)

(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Ma', we here, we gon' cook this Sunday, okay? So come by
Damn, that's your new girlfriend?

[Verse 1]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet, like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yo, you heard the track I did, man? ""This Can't Be Life""
Somebody please say grace, so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it, why the guard had to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh, who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it

Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me ten seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""

No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""

[Saxophone Solo]
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""
[JAY-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]
And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[JAY-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]

""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""

[JAY-Z: ""So what you think of this?""]

And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Donda West: ""Come on, let's just go""]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Donda West: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""

[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]

""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""

[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""
[JAY-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad
[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]

Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay, man, just make sure it's not wack.""

[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""

[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]

""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""

[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""

[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]

""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

3xm7ZFI0qTZrzjXOJ8SQ09,HOV DID,"13 ContributorsHOV DID Lyrics[Ari Melber]
Now to our special report. Around the world, many nations face corruption. In the U.S., police often tell themselves a story about America being exceptional or superior to other nations when the facts show there is American corruption in voting rights, criminal justice, housing policy. A political system that faces legal corruption with some of the most expensive campaigns in the world and many critiques of U.S. foreign policy, which brings us to this 1996 exchange, between Louis Farrakhan and CBS'S Mike Wallace

[Mike Wallace & Louis Farrakhan]
You got to Nigeria, which is, if not the most corrupt nation in Africa‚Äîand it is‚Äîit could be the most corrupt nation in the world
35 years old. That's what that nation is. Now, here's America, 226 years old. 30 years ago, black folk got the right to vote. You're not in any moral position to tell anybody how corrupt they are. You should be quiet. When you have spilled the blood of human beings‚Äîhas Nigeria dropped an atomic bomb and killed people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Have they killed off millions of native Americans? How dare you put yourself in that position as a moral judge? I think you should keep quiet
Can you think of one more corrupt?
Yeah, I'm living in one. I'm living in one. I didn't mean to be so fired up
No, no, that's good
That's my passion

[Ari Melber]
Farrakhan was not correct about everything in his career, but those points resonated with many, as he dispatched the contradiction between America's reality and perhaps her selective vision of herself. Corruption just refers to fraudulent conduct by the powerful, which is pervasive across American history, and especially in the long war on drugs. So remember that exchange‚Äîwe will come back to it. Tonight in this report, about the failed and the often racist war on drugs, which started so long ago, that we've covered this story many ways. Tonight, we're going to look at it through the life and poetry of an American who lived it, and lived to tell about it. And he sure is telling. It's an American dream story and you may know some of it. But you don't know all of it, especially since the story's not over. And a new instalment just came out heading into this weekend, as Jay-Z uses an unusually long four minutes of straight poetry to tackle the drug war, business, discrimination, and perseverance. The poetry is spoken over a beat in a song with other artists. And I think you will see why it's poetry as we go through it now. Jay, also known at Hov, marvelling how he went from poverty to a billion and touting, how those others basically came from his same space or crib. Kanye, who worked with him as a producer and collaborator. Rihanna, who Jay signed early on, and LeBron, who's linked to Jay's Roc Nation company. So Jay's reference there to, ""technically"", is both the caveat, LeBron's done plenty on his own, and a double entendre for technical fouls in basketball. Jay opens there by asking forgiveness for making his first dollars off drugs, cooked on a stove, and notes he left that. Drug or dope game with his record clean, turning the cocaine into champagne. And that's a nod to his ability to evade charges. A clean record gave him the lane to go from street coke, to the good life of the champagne. It's also a play on how he makes money off records, his albums are now clean records since he left the street life, while the alchemy of turning illegal coke into legal bubbly sounds like a turn on Jesus turning water to wine, and it is, because soon after, Jay completes the parallel

[Jay-Z]
Jesus turned water to wine, for Hov, it just took a stove

[Ari Melber]
But think about it. There's nothing automatically legitimate about wine or champagne. It was criminally punished during prohibition, a policy that ultimately fueled gangs and violence and was the only constitutional amendment ever to be reversed because both parties determined that prohibition was a messy failure, so politicians turned the alcohol back to a legitimate business, a slippery spectrum, which Jay notes a few lines later in this poem saying, ""Breezy what the business is, we pushin‚Äô Fenty like Fentanyl, the 'ish is all legitimate, E was down ten for this"". And those lines quickly go from prohibition to a war on street drugs, associated with minorities, as mentioned earlier in this broadcast, to Fentanyl, a huge driver of drug problems and deaths, which politicians do not treat criminally, the same way they attacked the drugs that Jay or others once sold. I can tell you corporations have made over 10 billion dollars selling addictive painkillers‚Äîlegally. So that's a contrast. Jay also invokes the fellow billionaire Rihanna, citing her Fenty fashion line, noting everything they produce now, that they deal, if you will, is legitimate. And that other line I mentioned refers to ""E,"" Emory Jones, his an associate who served roughly ten years with a drug sentence and now works at Jay's company. And look, many listeners may not know his name, but the story is something so many communities know. It illustrates how hundreds of thousands of others are locked up for nonviolent drug offences. The data shows the drug war is discriminatory, that entire categories of drugs can be arbitrarily banned, or allowed, often depending on who is really using them. That ranges from prohibition like I mentioned to the opioid abuse, which does not involve the same sentences dealt to Black and Brown Americans. Or marijuana, long classified as the most severe federal level, schedule one. But now, bet you've heard about this, marijuana has been shifted by politicians and voters, to legal, in 19 states and counting. But the warehousing of so many people for drugs that are now, right now illegal all over the nation, well, as a policy matter, it's absurd. Even before you get to race, it's also been documented as racist. Now, Jay did evade indictment for dealing illegal drugs. Now he gets paid for selling legal ones. He founded the upscale 'Monogram' marijuana company, which is a play on the traditional term, 'monogram', a reference to selling a gram, and this poem marvels about living on both sides of the law in one lifetime, as this law around the country has been changing. I want you listen here as Jay conjures the image of a monogram joint in his pocket, while actual monograms are often embroidered on the breast pocket. Jay invokes being a writer. He's careful with his sentences, or bars as lyrics are called, because he lives now the legitimate life. Writing sentences, not jail sentences. Rap bars, not jail bars. And those jail bars come from the Draconian Laws, so he'll clash with those who make the laws he says‚Äîas he calls that clash with the plain term, 'smoke', which is also a play on the smoke he now sells legally. It's deep. This is the kind of elevated prism for these issues. I can tell you we've interviewed many lawmakers who don't come close to this level of nuance about drug policy and its arbitrary and pernicious results. The same song then briefly explores how pain fuels growth

[Jay-Z]
All this pain from the outside, inspired all this growth within
So new planes gettin' broken in
Highest elevation of the self
They done ‚Äî around and gave the right ‚Äî wealth
You might also like[Ari Melber]
Now, those new planes could be just private jets. As Jay notes you would need to right people to buy them, the right brothers with enough wealth, or a double entendre there apparently, to The Wright Brothers who invented plane travel. The same line cites another Jay business, the 'Paper Planes' brand, which tees off a sorta' childhood imagination when you fold a paper plane. Now, am I reaching? Well, art is always up for interpretation, but I can tell Jay's long time producer, Young Guru, decodes this part of a verse in a new video that was just posted online

[Young Guru]
You got to realize that everything being said in here is
A fact, bruh, it's not aspirational no more. New planes getting broken in. It's like literally paper planes, the brand, so new clothes, like when you try on new clothes you're breaking in new clothes them. Man just ordered a new plane. But then it's new planes getting broken in, new levels of existence

[Ari Melber]
All right, so if you're counting, that's airplanes, the planes company, 'Paper Planes', and planes of existence. Quadruple entendre. This poetry like other great art, takes more time to fully understand than it takes to just see or hear on a first glance. That is why many people say Jay remains the greatest of all time, known by the acronym, G.O.A.T., and by at the end of this dense poetic verse, which just dropped on Friday, Jay admonishes his‚Äîwould be judges or competitors‚Äîas donkeys, a play on G.O.A.T., but then makes a reference that takes us all the way back to where we began

[Jay-Z]
Next time we have a discussion who the G.O.A.T., you donkeys know this
Forgive me, that's my passion talkin' (Haha)
Sometimes I feel like Farrakhan (Haha) talkin' to Mike Wallace (Haha)
I think y'all should keep quiet

[Ari Melber]
That's his passion talking. Jay invoking that classic moment we showed you to offset his own grandiose talk. Asking forgiveness for being so strident, even as he meant every word. But notice what else he's doing, ending this poem just as he began it when he asked forgiveness for dealing drugs in his youth. And notice what else he's doing, a Farrakhan parallel can apply just to proclaiming himself the greatest, that would like, I think, a little [?], or maybe it can apply all the way back to this entire poem about America's drug war and Jay's own path. Think about it‚Äîdecades in, this billionaire entrepreneur with proven success, measurable success in music, media, sports, business, law, and politics, still finds he must explain basic facts about American corruption and racism to elite and White society, and many leaders and people still don't see it, or refuse to face it. That kind of entitled ignorance, which can cause real damage to real people's lives, well, that might raise your ire. It might get your passion talking. And if the facts are talking, well, it's a good time for people to listen. And then listen again, and make sure you got the pointEmbed"

Kill JAY-Z, they'll never love you
You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, JAY-Z
Fuck JAY-Z, I mean, you shot your own brother
How can we know if we can trust JAY-Z?
And you know better, nigga, I know you do
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, you had the armor
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer
Die JAY-Z, this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi, JAY-Z
Cry JAY-Z, we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up, JAY-Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with JAY-Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him twenty million without blinkin'
He gave you twenty minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Ben√©t
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga, never go Eric Ben√©t!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the future other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it

Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate

Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her

I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic 'bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin'
A nigga up in the hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear
In my rear-view mirror objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America like me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside a line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow
I spaz on the stove, this is Hov, no flex zone
Nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you're a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me

Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles

We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said: ""Don't embarrass me"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love

Y'all couldn't stop me, you're not as tough as you say you are
My advice is just don't be too nice to niggas
Just set your price on niggas and live your life, my nigga
Once upon a time in the projects
Shawn was in flight mode, I bought a Pyrex
I was in fight mode and now it's ""Fuck me, mijo""
I was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples
Sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools
Who they effin' with, and we got FN's too
Before we had A&R's, we had AR's too
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did
Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid

Got the heart of a giant, don't you ever forget
Don't you never forget, Jigga got this shit poppin'

I studied Muslim, Buddhist, and Christians

They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin' for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs

You in the presence of a king
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I escaped, a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras, you over baby
Robinson Cano, you coming with me
These niggas like rotary phones
It's a new day, hit up KD
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldn't let me in
I ball so hard on ESPN
See my name come across on CNN

7vhNrY84MhRIgjqvYXVBhP,Versus,"1 ContributorGrand Champ LyricsIn 1998 DMX became only the second rapper to have two albums debut at #1 in one year. While on his way to selling nearly 30 million records domestically, Earl Simmons released five consecutive albums that debuted at #1 on the Billboard magazine Top 200 Albums chart. During the course of a commercially successful and critically acclaimed career, X has also been a frequent visitor to many a courtroom. This was a fact not lost on Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons

‚ÄúDMX is practicing really hard at being good‚Äîhe‚Äôs just really fucked up,‚Äù Simmons wrote in his 2001 biography Life And Def: Sex, Drugs, Money & God. ‚ÄúBut he keeps trying. His records It‚Äôs Dark and Hell Is Hot and Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood, are about being in pain. He‚Äôs frustrated at his inability to change. Every time he gets a glimpse of something good, he wants to change and become good. But he just can‚Äôt stay on the right path‚Ä¶‚Äù

X‚Äôs off-the-mic struggles took another turn this week when it was announced he verbally agreed to a boxing match with George Zimmerman‚Äîthe man infamous for the 2012 killing of Florida teen Trayvon Martin. A lot of keystrokes have been used explaining why Zimmerman potentially profiting from any of the fame he‚Äôs enjoyed since Martin‚Äôs death is a horrible idea. While we wholeheartedly agree with that point, there‚Äôs no need to be redundant. In the rare event you need a refresher, there‚Äôs been some excellent writing on the matter by both David D. of TheSmokingSection and Grantland‚Äôs Rembert Browne

Sadly, X‚Äôs stated desire to fight and urinate on Zimmerman will most likely not end well for the Yonker‚Äôs-bred rapper, but it also comes as no surprise. In hopes of looking at DMX at a time when he wasn‚Äôt representing Hip Hop (and humanity) in the worst possible light and understanding what led to the sad state of affairs that has him even contemplating the buffoonery of squaring off with Zimmerman, here are some other notable feuds in which he‚Äôs participated

DMX Versus Drugs

Sadly, rumors that this battle is still ongoing won‚Äôt be quelled by the fact that X verbally agreed to fight George Zimmerman. DMX has previously been arrested for drug possession and animal cruelty in May of 2008 after attempting to barricade himself in his Cave Creek, Arizona home. He was also cited for marijuana possession in Greer, South Carolina three months later

‚ÄúUntil I die, I will always have a drug problem,‚Äù DMX told Iyanla Vanzant during a multi-episode appearance on the OWN show, Iyanla: Fix My Life. ‚ÄúI smoke weed. I drink‚Ä¶ Coke, crack‚Äînow I don‚Äôt really fuck with that. Since I‚Äôve been home from prison almost three years, I slipped a couple times, but I got right back up. When I first got signed, I almost went out of my mind.‚Äù

DMX Versus Jay Z

Before this pair both rose to stardom under the Def Jam umbrella, they faced off in a legendary battle (the original undercard was Ruff Ryders‚Äô Harlem Knights versus Original Flavor, who was managed by Damon Dash) in a pool hall in the Bronx. Good luck finding any footage, as Ruff Ryders CEO Joaquin ‚ÄúWaah‚Äù Dean ordered everyone in attendance to turn off their cameras

‚ÄúIt was dope,‚Äù Ski Beatz recalled in a 2011 interview with HipHopDX. ‚ÄúDMX, at the time, I had never really heard of DMX. I didn‚Äôt know who this kid was. But to hear him rhyme live, I was like, ‚ÄòThis dude is really ill.‚Äô He was really good. But the battle was good. Jay did his thing; DMX did his thing. You could tell people from DMX‚Äôs side were feelin‚Äô Jay, and you could tell people from Jay‚Äôs side were feelin‚Äô DMX. It was a mutual, ‚ÄòOkay, both these guys are dope.‚Äô‚Äù

Through a mutual friendship with Irv Gotti, Jay and X became friends and collaborated with each other. But in a 2011 Vibe magazine interview, DMX told Mikey Fresh things turned sour after Jay was appointed as the president of Def Jam

‚Äú[Jay Z] gave me the call, he called me personally,‚Äù DMX said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòYeah, that‚Äôs wassup! My mans is in a position now, he‚Äôs the president of the label I‚Äôm on, we good!‚Äô Next thing you know, he‚Äôs out of retirement and I‚Äôm off the label. What a coincidence.‚Äù

DMX Versus Ja Rule
You might also likeThis was another case of things turning sour between label mates and mutual friends friends of Irv Gotti. Any hopes of the Jay Z, DMX and Ja Rule troika collectively recording as Murder Inc. ended when X went on record in 2002 with MTV‚Äôs Shaheem Reid about a Ja Rule diss song entitled ‚ÄúRuled Out.‚Äù The Dog leveled claims that Ja was both biting his trademark style and ‚Äúgetting a little too Hollywood.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just sick of the bullshit,‚Äù X told Big Von of KMEL in a subsequent interview. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of money sounding like me. I‚Äôm sick of niggas smiling in my face, and he‚Äôs a fake-type nigga. I‚Äôm just sick of all that. I can‚Äôt hold it in but for so long.‚Äù

DMX and Ja repaired their relationship to the point where they were civil with one another, and based on X‚Äôs 2011 interview with Vibe, that‚Äôs where X would like to keep things

‚ÄúWe cool, but he‚Äôs just not the type of nigga that I would hang with,‚Äù X explained. ‚ÄúHe never was the type of nigga I would hang with. But we was cool. I‚Äôd work with you, and yeah we can go to the studio, but we just two different people.‚Äù

DMX Versus Xavier Simmons (and Iyanla Vanzant)

You can‚Äôt really process the televised ‚Äúreunion‚Äù between DMX and his son, Xavier Simmons without at least partially admitting Iyanla Vanzant manipulated the entire situation for television viewers. It appeared Xavier and his father were on the road to reconciliation before Vanzant imposed a list of conditions and essentially coached the younger Simmons into calling their relationship ‚Äútoxic.‚Äù And, if you‚Äôre familiar with X, you can pretty much predict how that exchange ended without suffering through a second of the insipid, Iyanla: Fix My Life

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs gonna be a condition...if there‚Äôs gonna be a demand, when all I‚Äôve given you is unconditional love, I‚Äôm not gonna allow that,‚Äù X responded. The exchange ended with DMX telling Xavier, ‚ÄúSee you at my funeral.‚Äù Based on his May, 2013 interview with Pigeons And Planes, Xavier and his father still aren‚Äôt exactly on good terms

DMX Versus Kurupt

‚ÄúMothafuck D, mothafuck M, / Only X I know is Xzibit or RBX / Extraordinary, tryin‚Äô to snatch my bitch / You can have the bitch / Two bitches gettin‚Äô ripped...‚Äù Talk about shots fired. Kurupt asserted DMX engaged in coitus with his then fiancee, Foxy Brown, with little to publicly corroborate the accusation. What actually happened is anyone‚Äôs guess. But other than a 2002 interview with XXL in which he essentially said he didn‚Äôt know what Kurupt was talking about, X brushed the accusations aside...although he may have thrown some subliminal shots at Kurupt on ‚ÄúParty Up‚Äù with the following bars:

‚ÄúY‚Äôall niggas is characters, not even good actors / What‚Äôs gon‚Äô be the outcome, hmm, let‚Äôs add up all the factors / You wack, you‚Äôre twisted, your girl's a ho / You‚Äôre broke, the kid ain‚Äôt yours, and everybody know.‚Äù

Luckily, cooler heads prevailed over time

‚ÄúRight now, me and Earl and very good, cool friends,‚Äù Kurupt said in a 2013 interview with HipHopDX. ‚ÄúI seen him in the airport, and we squashed our differences. I found out he‚Äôs a good person. He‚Äôs a good nigga. That nigga is a good nigga. We had a good talk, had a couple shots. It was real cool.‚ÄùEmbed"

It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
Baby need Pampers
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely?
Now I'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody, I need a joint right now

I seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin' crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me
I got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me

[Hook]
High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest
[Interlude]
""No... wire... hangers... EVER!""

[Verse 3]
Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no momma drama
I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared
But in life and death if I ain't here

[Hook]
High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest21Embed"

Nickels and dimes
Sticks to my mind
I want more than
You have my friends

[Verse 1]
Got a thing for nickel plated nines and pretty dimes
MAC-11, I squeeze like lemon limes
Squirt obey your thirst, fashion lines
'tween beauty and beast, I walk the line
Johnny Cash, I'm a real G
I cut myself today to see if I still bleed
Success is so sublime
Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind
Something 'bout the struggle so divine
This sort of love is hard to define
When you scratching for every nickel and dime
Got me itching to do this shit for my mom
Do this shit for my town
Leave the door open hoping they kick it down
The purest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous
We gon' make it there, I promise this

I gave some money to this guy, he got high as hell
Now I'm part of the problem far as I could tell
Did I do it for him or do it for myself
Can't lie to myself
I love my niggas more than my own blood
I die for my niggas and I love my cub, hope that's not fucked up
I got a problem with the handouts, I took the man route
I'll give an opportunity though, that's the plan now
No guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out
No guilt in receiving, every thing within reason
Can't see it taking food out my little monster's mouth
That'll drive me gaga
Run up in your momma's house, two nickels, one dime
Manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down
I'm just trying to find common ground
'fore Mr. Belafonte come and chop a nigga down
Mr. Day O, major fail
Respect these youngins boy, it's my time now
Hublot homie, two door homie

Pardon my hubris, Stanley Kubrick
With eyes wide shut, I could cook up two bricks
Turn nickels to dime, turn dimes to quarters
Turn wives from daughters, oh, I'm clear as water
And just for clarity, my presence is charity
My flow is a gift, philanthropist
Everybody 'round me rich, or will be
Baby boy I promise you this, or kill me
And when a nigga go as the old adage go
You die rich and you die disgraced, so just let me grow
Watch me cook, throw no looks
Like Magic in his prime when Kareem sky hooked, yeah

Y'all don't deserve me, my flow unearthly

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats

Coke on her Black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read, ""No apologies""
The other said, ""Love is cursed by monogamy""
That's something that the pastor don't preach
That's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money, we can't keep
But we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach

2Zb7wnGUnNPCas2E0wWSQ5,Ni**as In Paris,"4 ContributorsHot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history.

Hello, can I speak to, uh

Yeah, you know who you are, look
You had no idea what ya dealing with
Something on some this realest shit
Pop champagne, I'll give you a sip
'Bout to go dumb, how come?
Yeah, that's my bitch
That's my bitch
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch
That's my bitch
[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life, and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I paid for them titties, get your own
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats, she learning a new word, it's yacht
Blew the world up soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors, ball players, and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story, True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak, huh? Rockstar life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey, boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv that's tryna play second fiddle?
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money, I put Monie in the middle

Go harder than a nigga for a nigga, go figure
Told me keep my own money if we ever did split up
How could somethin' so gangster be so pretty in pictures?
Ripped jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Uh, Picasso was alive, he would've made her
That's right, nigga, Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white?
Put some colored girls in the MoMA
Half these broads ain't got nothing on Willona
Don't make me bring Thelma in it
Bring Halle, bring Pen√©lope and Salma in it, uh
Back to my Beyonc√©s
You deserve three stacks, word to Andr√©
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in mo-seums
You belong in vintage clothes, crushing the whole building
You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing
You too dope for any of those civilians
Now shoo, children, stop looking at her tits
Get your own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch

I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5 (Ooh, woo)
I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin'
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending (Yeah)
Where the fuck is the sun? It's been a while
Mama, look at your son, what happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
Goddamn, I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the pres'?

No crying in public, just lying to judges
Riskin' my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it, well

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing, uh
All-black everything, nigga, you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress load
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, ""Damn, I was just with him after school""
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine Black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours

'Cause I can still hear his mama cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died, uh
Real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21, I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? Uh, what up, cuz? Uh, it's all Black, uh, I love us

In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs

No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new Black elite
They say my Black Card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few Blacks the higher I go, uh
What's up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain't enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yeah, it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for Black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause there ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord

These are all the makings of you (Woo)

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Pete Rock]
I do it for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors
That are now A&Rs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed, but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now it's crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel
Don C. just had a shorty, so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

Now one room got Gidget, the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they Black, they sisters
They mama named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid questions like, ""Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?""
This beat deserves Hennessy
A bad bitch, and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed? Well, mine's an obscenity

Takin' sips of Pop's six-pack of Miller nips
Pink Champale, Ballantine Ale
Ballys on my feet help me balance out well (Woo)
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats

Coke on her Black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read, ""No apologies""
The other said, ""Love is cursed by monogamy""
That's something that the pastor don't preach
That's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money, we can't keep
But we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap

1auxYwYrFRqZP7t3s7w4um,Ni**as In Paris,"4 ContributorsHot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history.

Arm out the window, through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snapback, see my cut through the holes, Hov

Go harder than a nigga for a nigga, go figure
Told me keep my own money if we ever did split up
How could somethin' so gangster be so pretty in pictures?
Ripped jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Uh, Picasso was alive, he would've made her
That's right, nigga, Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white?
Put some colored girls in the MoMA
Half these broads ain't got nothing on Willona
Don't make me bring Thelma in it
Bring Halle, bring Pen√©lope and Salma in it, uh
Back to my Beyonc√©s
You deserve three stacks, word to Andr√©
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in mo-seums
You belong in vintage clothes, crushing the whole building
You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing
You too dope for any of those civilians
Now shoo, children, stop looking at her tits
Get your own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch

Just to get off and throw my hands up high

Ayy
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
(Yeah, yeah)
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
(Yeah, uh, yeah)
I asked her where she wanna be when she twenty-five (Five)
She turned around and looked at me and she said, ""Alive""
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
(Uh, oh)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Swizz Beatz]
Black Axl Rose, move halves and wholes (Right)
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov (Right)
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears (Oh)
Work pots and pans just to cop me some Airs (Goddammit)
My uncle died, my daddy did too (Ayy)
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
My nephew gone, my heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard

Why I pray so hard, this is crazy, God
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
So que ser√° (Welcome to the jungle), get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain 'fore it goes too far (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
My dreams is big, reality set in (Huh)
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon (Yeah)
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5 (Ooh, woo)
I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin'
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending (Yeah)
Where the fuck is the sun? It's been a while
Mama, look at your son, what happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
Goddamn, I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the pres'?
Either they know or don't care, I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public, just lying to judges
Riskin' my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it, well

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing, uh
All-black everything, nigga, you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress load
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, ""Damn, I was just with him after school""
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine Black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours

'Cause I can still hear his mama cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died, uh
Real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21, I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? Uh, what up, cuz? Uh, it's all Black, uh, I love us

Huh, yeah, uh

Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new Black elite
They say my Black Card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few Blacks the higher I go, uh
What's up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain't enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yeah, it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for Black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause there ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor

Rome's burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone, burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead, but I'm sorry, but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So when love is gone 'til blood is drawn
'Cause we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you, squares, the circle got smaller

Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you

Please, not Jay, he's not for play

I will end it, all that yappin' be finished

Don't make me expose you to them folks that don't know you

Ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
I appreciate that
Uh

[Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch

Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up (Holla at me)

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks
[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA

Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
[Verse 3]
Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy
[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me

I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
Ma cherie amour, tu es belle
Merci, you're fine as fuck, but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather?
She said, ""All you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me, you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian, and Black

Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough, she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the narcs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
Goddamn, she's fine, but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat-back love
So I had to introduce her to the mile high club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project, and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills, and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first-class seat, I love

Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through
Got this weed-head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl, wanna leave me, but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull

I'm like, ""Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass

Or might take sips of Army with a chiddick, I'm so sick with it
Lampin' in the Hamptons
The weekends, man, the Stan Smith Adidas and the Campus
Or playin' guts on the cruise, Herm√®s boat shoes
The Izod bucket on, I'm so old-school
Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops
Six top model chicks, who is this hot?

'Cause the boy got more sixes than first grade

So sleep if you need to, mami, I will leave you

Turn my music high, high, high, higher
(You don't know what you're doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî)
Sure, I do

[Verse 1]
I'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and
Bullets'd follow 'em and
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
And say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone
Welcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come, you better return 'em
All scars, we earn 'em
All cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it
Was clappin' them flamers before I became famous
For playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless

[Verse 3]
I came into this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, from grindin' G-packs
Put this shit in motion, ain't no rewindin' me back
Could make forty off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov would sell clothin'
Not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
I smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin' at one smart Black boy
Mama ain't raise no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth, motherfucker
[Interlude]
I will not lose (You don't know what you're doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî)
Put somethin' on it

[Verse 4]
I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in Hell
I am a hustler, baby, I'll sell water to a whale

Cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate, never follow orders, dick face
Get your shit straight, fucker, this is Big Jay

And my record's movin' out the store?

My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems,"" gotta move carefully

Get a couple chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll m√©nage before I reach my garage

Well, fuck y'all, I needed money for Atari
Was so young, my big sis still playin' with Barbie
Young brother, big city, eight million stories
Old heads taught me, ""Youngin, walk softly""
Carry a big clip that'll get niggas off me
Keep coke in coffee, keep money smellin' mothy

That's the ritual (Yup), Big Ran, I ain't forget you, fool
And all that bullshit you tryin' to get through
This is crew love, move music or move drugs
Rival crews, get your black suits up, I'll never change

Never, never, never, never change
I'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (I never change, c'mon)
Out hustlin', same clothes for days (I never change)

Picture all the possibilities
Sounds like a love song
Sounds like a love song
The most incredible, baby
Uh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah
Uh
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 1]
Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first-class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside, a nigga so sick

I can't see it comin' down my eyes

[Verse 2]
On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me & My Bitch""
Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', ""Let me see that clip""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed-out buggy
And then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you
[Chorus]
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 3]
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
[Chorus]
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry

Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo

Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench

By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you

Mama loved me, pop left me
Mickey fed me, Annie dressed me
Eric fought me, made me tougher
Love you for that, my nigga, no matter what, bruh
Marcy raised me, and whether right or wrong
Streets gave me all I write in this song
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school
Valencia's boyfriend Volvo had me making moves
Mama raised me, pop, I miss you
God, help me forgive him, I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears, Annie shampooed my hair
Eric was fly, shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong
Years going past fast, let's move along
Kitchen table, that's where I honed my skills
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee
Clark sought me out, Dame believed
Primo laced me, Ski did too
Reasonable Doubt, classic, shoulda went triple
Mama loved me, pop left me
Grandma dressed me, plus, she fed me
Banana pudding was in the hood then
Puffing on L's, drinking pink Champale
Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. spot
Tone, Mike 'Zo and them niggas, V.A.'s locked
Biggs fucked with a nigga, what's up, Hoff?
Bee-High hated the fact I put rap to the back
Money pouring in, clientele growing now
Birth of my first nephew, time to slow it down
October 21st, Lavelle came to the world
Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl
Mama loved me, Ti-Ti, Uncle Jay
Loves you to death, won't let no trouble come your way
Oh, can't forget my man down in Maryland
He's gone 'til November, how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
And your son, too, it's nothing I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me
Talked to me rudely 'cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black and living a movie, not living by rules

That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter, 'round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me Hova
I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds, so when the nerds asleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death
I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (Run), pull up in a drop (Pull up)
Push up on my money (Push up), I'm in great shape, dunny (Woo)
I keep jacks jumping, thirty-six sets
Like a personal trainer, I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats, all-white trainers

Born sinner, the opposite of a winner (Ooh)

Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good (Ooh)

Yes, yes YEP!
Welcome to the.. Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some
Uhh

[Chorus]
Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable
Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)

[Verse 1]
Follow the flow, look
They say a midget standin' on the giant's shoulder can see much
Further than the giant.. (the giant..)
So I got the whole rap world on my shoulder they tryin' to see
Further than I am... (than I am..)
And I have been tryin' to be patient with they preoccupation
With David and Goliath.. (Goliath..)
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course
And I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)
But me and Tyran, comin' through your environment
Iron mask, nigga, iron gats, nigga I am back
With ""The Team,"" no I in that
R.O.C., y'all not eyein' that
Y'all don't see, clearly 'cause the rain ain't gone
""The Dynasty,"" no not Ming but Shawn's
Dame, Kareem, nigga it's the gangsta team
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason, we got a gang of green
If there's better at gettin' cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga
(WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!) Jeah, jeah

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable
[Verse 2]
Jeah, look
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm 'bout to start another life
Look behind you, I'm 'bout to pass you twice
Back to the future, gotta slow up for the present
I'm fast, niggas can't get pass my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session
Ain't no livin' person can test him
Only two restin' in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight Summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get it I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
And that goes for everything from flippin' that raw
Flippin' whores, flippin' vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)
[Chorus]
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)

[Verse 3]
Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order, the number one rap recorder is back
You cats over-felt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the real for real
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Why I'm in the position that I am
Changin' the game, my game could nail Madonna
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the makin', Pistol Pete
Leave competition shakin' without missin' the beat (woo!)
Chasin' the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holdin' it's breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow-tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Live and direct, I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
Rapper slash Exec., Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
You ain't a factor, who are you foolin'?
You all are faggots, you takin' us backwards (takin' it backwards)
I'm tryin' to progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga your whole career's a accident
Who was gassin' 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable

That's how I live for a livin', nigga
I'm watching
'Kay, let's do this
The Watcher!
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
But I'm a lil' too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespectin' the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting in Pampers
I was moving them grams 'fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was
Ducking the vans, radars and scanners
Before you knew what hard white or tan was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands cause I'm hype with them hammers
I was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a fam' was
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mil' later‚Äînow you understand us
Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night?
Grand, fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was putting Peter Pan up in your room
Y'all fuckin' with whom? Allow me to retort
You cowards is just now learnin' the shit that we taught
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
'Bout a high-speed Porsche
I.e., you niggas ain't know how to floss
'Til I came through the door like ""Eric B. for Prez""
Respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us ‚Äòcause you got a little check cut
You was sucking 'em so long, fucking your lil' neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hef', but you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggas that got life really like what I sing
‚ÄòCause they know what it's really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I don't write
Be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game
Word to the hyphen in my name!
J-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa
The past, present, nigga, the future, proper
The Holy Trinity in hip-hop is us
We give Dre his props, but that's where it stops
It's the Roc!

But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me

[Chorus: Terri]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go

Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still droppin' flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top, had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters want a stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the man
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane, the odds that I played
The best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher
[Bridge: Truth Hurts]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me

[Verse 3: Rakim]
I'm rated R, my brain contains graphic things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
It's like watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic‚Äîthe object? A fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
Take away to add a profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open‚ÄîThe Watcher
[Bridge: Truth Hurts]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me

Just don't know me no more

Look for me
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B, holla

All around the world
Same song (Same song)
Brooklyn bombers (Same song, same song)
Detroit players (Oh, same song)
Chi-Town (Hey, all around the world)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Said it's all love, Shore Club, M-I-A
Party at Bungalow 8 when I stay
Pool look like a hundred Beyonc√©s
A couple fianc√©s, I'm the new DeVante
Come and talk to me mami in the Yves Saint
Laurent, I hope she ain't too young (Woo)
Only twenty-one and older, let another nigga mold her
I'm just tryna show her how a baller and a roller
Sleep one place, tell the pilot keep the engine
Runnin' then I wake up in Martha's Vineyard
St. Bart's this year I think I'm gon' spend Christmas
Reminiscin' 'bout the time my mom couldn't spend Christmas
Now I'm gon' send her on her own little wish list
Anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl
Forever my lady, blind, crippled and crazy
A ticket and your favorite CD, sweet Sadie

[Bridge: LaToiya Williams]
Sadie (Sadie)
Don't you know I love you, sweet Sadie? (I love you, Sadie)
All around the world
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Said it ain't, ""Where you from?"" Yo it's, ""Where you at?""
Real niggas out in Brooklyn, some niggas don't clap
It's real killers out in Cali, some niggas just act
Hollywood like they out the hood, it's all to the good
Real players in the D-Twa, some of them throwed
Slackin' or they mackin', rest haven for hoes
Real pranksters in the Chi, most of them real folks
Disciplined Gangsters, come on Charlie, I know
Shit, it ain't about your city or borough
It's 'bout if you really as thorough and if you are, holla at your boy
I put my hand on my heart, that means I feel you
Real recognize real and you lookin' familiar
I'm a Bed-Stuy nigga but I do it to death
I promise I'm in St. Thomas homie eatin' at Chef's
112, ATL, the sun up yet?
Then we party like the sun don't set

[Outro: LaToiya Williams]

And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught (Caught, ugh)

And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags (Bags)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
""So Fresh, So Clean"" like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin' tags
Leavin' the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
""Aw, fuck, there he go again
Talkin' 'bout hoes and dough again""‚Äîyup!
Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusing about the dough I spend
But I was holdin' then, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that, man
Fall back, I bought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rearview
V12 engine, corners spinning
Twinkies shinin', pinky ring
Armadale, nigga, stinky-stink
Top down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck, ma
That's right, you in luck, ma
You see me cruisin' down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First-come, first-served basis
You know Hov' be goin' to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin' cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll with your boy, you'll be poppin' tags

[Verse 2: Twista]
It's a party when I go up in the store
Shopping while I'm zooted off the dro
Rolling like a nigga that just came up on a mil'
And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the floor
Bag full of clothes, I remember having rocks in the hall
On the corner with the Glock by the balls
Serving up a jab and workin' security 6 to 6
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Buy what's on the wall, go ahead and treat yourself
When you come up on some cheddar, better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go up to the lot
And lay the paper down to cop that Jag'
I got a closet full of ammunition and funds
Mink, Rocawear and some guns, Pelle and a fresh pair of Jordans
Dro packs and Bo Jax and Air Maxes; throwbacks and 1's
No max for none
(When I go up in the store, a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller, if you want it, come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car, you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be chopping up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizzay
Poppin' big tags with the flow and the dough, we gets busy
[Chorus: Sleepy Brown, Jay-Z, & Killer Mike]

Let me tell you something 'bout me

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
My throwback game is whiffle-wicked
Saint Patty's Day, green pinstripe
Number 20, Mark Spitz'n'
Jersey, ooh-wee, with the matching New Era fitted
White boys say my style is bitchin'
Keeping coke in the kitchen
Keep a Glock that'll shock and bring the rest
Tucked underneath my Mitchell & Ness
I'm scramblin', handlin' with a .45 cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two-deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside, holla, Felli Fel
More G's on me than a late-eighties Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan
Old man with the gun in hand, I leave your blood squirtin'
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest
Of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordans and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy, speak easy
Slight with the fighting words
I'll put something hot through your motherfucking Iceberg
Got a project chica named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro, reefer
Small baby-black gat tucked in her Baby Phat
I rock some, roll chief sacks like Daddy Fat
[Chorus: Sleepy Brown, Jay-Z, & Big Boi]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught (Caught, ugh)
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought (Bought)

And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought (Woo)
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags (I'm poppin')
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Pop tags in reverse, you'll be needin' a nurse
Leave you laying on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your mama in all-black with a matchin' purse
I know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call 'cause your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox 'pecting a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD
That means ""Movie Date,"" ""Dinner Date,"" ""Lunch Date,"" help me
Please, my cheese is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimp-ously serve the song
Act a damn donkey like the pilgrims
When they popped the tag on the Indians' home
Drop top rag-o with the wind going
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of F.A.O. Schwartz for the chil'ens
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kidding
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the Honeycombs?
Oh now, you acting mad
'Cause the money done slowed down, just a lil bit
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall, bull-pit, dead game is the pulpit
Leave a motherpumper with his ""John Doe"" toe-tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin'
A miracle happenin'
Jay-Z, Killer Mike, and Big Boi rappin' and rhymin' and snappin'
Pop that tag on some of this game
No politics, swallow and keep the change

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Jay-Z]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught (Caught, ugh)

To the bed like a wrestler, had to pretzel her, uhh
Her man kept pagin', stressin' her
So I told her what to say just in case he question her

Rumor has it The Blueprint classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevara
Now it's a whole museum of Hov MC'ers
Everybody dupin' the flow‚Äîyou see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like they tryna make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and Kanyeezy
See how we adjust to the game so easy
Chicks belly dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like, ""Oh shit, he's so handsome""
Still in demand in the longest run standing
Kidnapped rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back, no rap

They only know what the single is
And single that out to be the meaning of what he's about
And being I'm about my business, not mingling much
Running my mouth, that shit kept lingering
But no, dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinkling
The album with to keep the registers ringing
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Geah, you jingling, baby
See, I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real OG should
""Oh, he's good""

Now, the end is near (Can you believe this shit Guru?)
So I face (I'm from the hood man) the final curtain
(No the REAL hood the hood, not the RAP hood)
(The REAL hood, like three pair of pants)
My friends, I'll say it clear (pair of sneakers)
(My moms is bustin' her ass) State my case
(Nigga I'm goin' to Japan tomorrow!) Which I'm certain
(You understand what I'm sayin'? Can you believe that?)
I lived a life that's full (They have people, waitin'
At the airport like five days like I'm a Beatle or somethin')
(That's real talk!) And I traveled each, and every highway
(Seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more
Much more than this (still here) I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
(Let's try this one, uhh, yeah!)

[Break: Jay-Z (Paul Anka sample)]
Gangsta nigga
Put my hustle down, tore the game up, nigga
Took your high score down, put my name up, nigga
Tore the doors down to the Hall of Fame is Jigga
I did it my way (and more.. much more than this)
That's right, it's a beautiful thing man!
(I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy) I did it my way -- Hovi baby!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas
Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform
Pop hurtin' assertive, flirted with death
Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
Grandma's favorite, she could not understand
How there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor
Had to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse
As a reminder that I make top paper?
Black entrepreneur, nobody did us no favors
Nobody gave us shit, we made us
The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis
Biggs the smart one on the low like Dean Martin
We came in this game, not beggin' niggas pardon
Demandin' y'all respect, hand over a check
And while y'all at it, hand over the jet
We the reason they ain't hand Def Jam over so quick
They knew every year I was droppin' new product
I was raisin' the stock up, while buildin' the Roc up
But that's alright, 'cause they knew they had to see us
When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-aires
Je-je-jeah!

You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude
They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
And they can look good by paintin' him as bad news
'Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views
Exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
So imagine how disturbed I was
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
Let me explain exactly how this shit was
This nigga Un, yo, I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin but it‚Äôs cool 'cause we back friends, it happened and it's over
It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to bein' Hova
Maybach with the chauffeur, laid back
Helicopter seat, feet inclined, shit feelin' like a sofa

Yeah, it's magic
Huh? Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz
And it's a Heavy D production, you bastards
Come on
Hah, hey yo, stop playing man
This is real serious, huh? (It's the Roc)
Yeah (Yo) yo, let's go

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Post Positano, Hov' hanging with Bono
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you too can cool out poolside at the Delano
If you too flow like you was out of your mind yo
'Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonald's
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple? Ya know
And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who knew estates? Throw it away
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play?
They giveth and they taketh, life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned guns into roses like two times today
Now here's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on, waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion, waiting for action
They say when you play with skills, good luck could happen
Let's go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit
You got it criss-crossed, ain't no turning me backwards
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual, he's criminally attached
I turned in all my rap chips, I'm earning my bachelors
By dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to the riches through trafficking
Through rapping and whatever's happening
Rocawear, I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
Every time I get out, they pull me right back in
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow, I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
Case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone, c'mon

Life is all about guns and roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind, some get chosen
Just like life, guns and roses
Life is all about guns and roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind, some get chosen
Just like life, guns and roses

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Tote more guns than roses, foes is
Visibly shook of the invisible bully (Let's go)
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
In order to experience joy, you need pain
Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain
You know the saying, somebody's loss is another's gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
A rainbow then the clouds come out, we do it again
Everything evens up, you just wait
Even a garbage can gets a steak
You ain't even a garbage can, you have faith
But when it turns your way, before it turns away
Gotta turn that into something, you gotta learn from Jay
You'll get return on your investment if attention you pay
Let's go

Some get left behind, some get chosen
Just like life, guns and roses
Life is all about guns and roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind, some get chosen
Just like life, guns and roses (Yeah!)
Life is all about guns and roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind, some get chosen

You gotta let this one breathe, Just'
Just let it breathe for a second
I'm not trying to give you no advice
Yup! Hovi's home!
The newest addition to the Roc: M.O.P

""The Blueprint 2"" is on its way
I know y'all hear my footsteps out there, I'm coming!
But I sure know, this is life, baby, baby
Let's go get 'em, Just'!

It's the MO-P! (Yes!)
And the ZIP code is 1 (1!) 2 (3!) 3
And motherfucker, we coming, 100 miles and gunning (Owwww!)
I'm still running with cats that rob
From the era of SL 80s and hatchback Saabs (Same game!)
Operation for this industry lockdown
We still tote hammers that go BLAKOW!
Run up if you wanna
Believe me, dog, these hammers with they owners
Fuck your G up, have you in blue Pampers, in a coma
And your family now mournin' ‚Äî look, seventy pounds gone
A little fuck, shriveled up, with a hospital gown on
(We holding it down, homes!) Keep pushing, we fell bastards
To get over, we grind with slippery shell tactics
Chippety-frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups
Lil' niglet, what the fuck you recording for? Nick Jr.?
(The game ain't changed!) It just got harder
Plus we sponsored by Laze, Dame Dash and Mr. S dot Carter

And someone should be telling 'em the veterans have came
And we're betterin' the game, you better make it rain
(Twenty-seven a gram) My man, it's better than cocaine
Now everything will change and this Family will rule the world
And you haters can eat a dick up 'til you hiccup and 'url
A decade on the grind (Uh) nigga, I paid mine
So it's my time to shine and for you to ride the pine
I won't sit back and rap like these dumbass kids

Young shitting on haters, I ain't fucking with y'all
For all my Brownsville neighbors‚Äî""How About Some Hardcore?""
And it just get worser, every time I sign my signature in cursive
Just add another million to these verses
One million, two million, three million, four
And the money's really worthless, I'm pissing you off on purpose
My nephews situated, and my mama is straight
So I'm ready for whatever drama should come my way
And you niggas rapping to me so your drama is fake
You dudes is noodles, I got more ziti to bake
You dudes is cake, I keep two biscuits on the waist
Razor blades under the tongue, I will eat your face
Appetite for destruction, I am starving today
Got a money-hungry lawyer that'll eat the case
And that's just food for thought, don't let it go to waste

Woo! Uhh, uhh
It's The Gift and the Curse
Uhh, uhh, yeah
First they love me then they hate me then they love me again
They love me again (Uhh)
Let's take a trip down
I got y'all

[Verse]
Let's take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain, grey skies, seems at the end of every
Young black life is this line, ""Damn, him already?
Such a good kid,"" got us pourin' Henn' already
Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above
When it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love
So give BIG a hug, tell Aaliyah I said, ""Hi""
'Til the next time I see her, on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him 'cause, in him, we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn
Poor Isis, that's his mama name
Mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?
Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him
Hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him
Isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him
Damn near impossible, only men can raise men
He was his own man, not even him can save him
He put his faith in a .38 in his waist
But when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate
End up dead before 38 and umm
That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world
Ol' girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away
Isis' life just ended on that rainy day
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed
Down at the city morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude
Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew
Angel dust dipped in woo!
She slipped into her own fantasy world
Had herself pregnant by a different dude
But reality bites and this is her life
He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife
It was just this night when moon was full
And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight
Had her soundin' like Lisa Lisa
I wonder if I take you home, will you still love me after this night?
Mike was the hard head from around the way
That she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype
Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
He was a Willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like
It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
But Isis liked this Broadway life
She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red, green and whites
Hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight
She was so turned on that she had to shower twice
How ironic it would be some fight that
Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life
See Mike at 32 was still on the scene
Had a son, 15, that he never saw twice
Sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like
""If that was my son, he would look much different
See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark""
So it's mama's baby, papa's maybe
Mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets (Fuck niggas want?)
Had his old reliable .38 gun in his reach
It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak
He runnin' around like life's a peach
'Til one day, he approached this thug that had a mean mug
And it looked so familiar that he called him ""Young Cuz""
Told him get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (Fuck you)
Instead he pulled out a newer .38 snub
He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (Hold up)
There was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before
It's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' his self more mature
And he took it as a sign from the Almighty Lord
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war
(What's that?) He who hesitates is lost
He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank
The old man didn't think, he just followed his instinct
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas be a father, you're killin' your son
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons

Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker
Some day the cops'll kill a muh'fucker
I don't always wanna be this drug dealing muh'fucker, damn
Wish I could take us all
On this magic carpet ride through the sky
I, used to play the hall and fifth floor
Me and my boys, we all poor, getting high
I, seen the worst of the worst
I deserve every blessing I received, I'm from the dirt
I, planted my seed on unfertile land

And, still I grew
Some how I knew that the sun'll shine through and
Touch my soul, take hold of my hand

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Twenty niggas on the block tryna chase that buck
Nosey neighbors and haters keep they face on stuck
Cops roll up on the pavement, break the dice games up
Moms smoke, kids can't chase the ice cream truck
Girls fighting over rope, the young boys hype things up
Niggas fighting over coke, the young boys light things up
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up
'Member Lil' Eddie draw, man, how he light Mean up?
Then they wonder why we light green up
Back to back steam up, try to relax but I can't, I lean up
Ain't the L or the reefer that steam up (That steam up)
It's my head and I'm stressed to the point I get a fever
Thinking 'bout the block and all the mothers and the kids
That can't leave and how the chinks gotta feed 'em
For the rest of they life
Fucking wings, fried vegetable rice
Gotta be kidding, no breakfast, Cap'n Crunch at night
How the kids eating lunch at night?
In they beds all bunched in tight, no less than three or four
You know how it go, two by the foot, two by the headboard
Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)
That's how I feel for them
We gotta grip of shorties on the block
All they do is smoke weed and drink 40s, cop they lil quarties
Enough to get the latest Roc, newest Glock, old Jordies

Right here's another lil' story 'bout this clique I claimed
Another chapter based on how I get that game
Just hanging round my neighborhood, bang my street
Sit and watch the passerbys play my sweep
Southside, Sunnyside is the blocks I run
South Acres, South Park, niggas all got guns
Over here we got this code Charlie, get that there
We know tomorrow ain't a promise so we get that now
Fuck sitting in the living room, guarding the steps
Working inside a smoke house, starving to death
Serving these niggas flippers, quarter-ounces and jippers
Agents snapping your picture, neighbors plotting to get ya
Situations a critic, I was out here be getting it
Living it like a savage 'cause nigga I gotta have it
They holding back on a motherfucker, I'm in it for the haul dawg
Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all y'all
The Lord be a-willing and the creek don't rise
I'ma be a nigga and these streets gon' rise

It's a word called love
Called looooove
Called looo-oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo-ove

Oh, this must be the way the nigga Pac felt when he made
Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me
Y'all niggas got me feelin' like all eyes on me, me against the world
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit
Thought niggas would appreciate what I did to this game
Being that I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggas would appreciate what I came and did
Since ninety-six, every year
Something must be seriously wrong with the world
I know y'all ain't hating

[Chorus]
(Some people hate) Don't tell me niggas is hating
(Some people hate) Uhh, nah, you know what I think?
(Some people hate) I think...
(I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind

Raw, rough and rugged, when addressing the mass public
My attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it
Got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck being famous, I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter, my success in this game
Is sort of like Pro-jectic Justice
A payment for brushes with police officers
A peace offering from the Gods for the streets I was tossed in
Til I'm deceased in a coffin
I'ma be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon change the numbers
It's the strengthening of chain among us
Please we ain't afraid of none of ya's; who want it with us?
Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon

[Chorus]
(Some people hate) Gyeah, uh, yeah
(Some people hate) Uh, uh, uh
(Some people hate) Yeah! You know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy

[Verse 2]
I guess it's just the penalty of leadership
I guess I'm what niggas wanna be and shit
Or niggas just bored wanna be in shit
'Fore they get to rappin', start believing it, think they Ali and shit
I roll with the punches so I survive
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise, surprise
They try to take me out the game but I's alive
It's like a old Negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
You bastards know me, the one and only
Big homie from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life
It's either that or y'all gon' make me
Put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga

Jealousy is a weak emotion, you gotta overcome that, man
(Some people kill their brothers)
C'mon man, be stronger than that.. you know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) You'll be alright though

[Verse 3]
Au contraire, nigga, I am here 'cause I earned this shit
By riding out when niggas had learners' permit
We bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
I bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out
Turn your six, I laid back in the Maybach
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggas from way back
Niggas wanna clown, but the pound, it don't play that
Get yourself found drowned where the lake at
Run up on 'em notoriously, take that, take that
And then we coming where your wake at
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that
Face facts, fake rap cats
Can't take back what I took back to the Brook, look

Amazin man, got your Elvis soul
I made my money! I don't trouble the law

I drive the gremlins crazy
You wanna know the time?
Better have your shades, see
My nigga please

My nigga, please - you ain't signin' no checks like these

Uhh, yeah, uh-uhh-uh
Uh-huh, uh-uh-uhh, uhh, uhh
I ain't tryin to be rude dude
But give a nigga some space
I ain't tryin to be rude dude
Just, give a nigga some space
Just tryin to talk honey dog
I ain't got time to waste (check it)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Why is you over here lookin' at me
While all these girls up in here?
What you gay? Nigga, Jay straight like Indian hair
Y'all don't want me to spray the semi in here
I mean if you a fan I consider you fam'
But shake a nigga hand, well shit god damn
All that (""Do you remember me dawg?"") Nah I'm drawin' a blank
You got me feelin like a fish, in a fish tank
Just think, if you came to a club
Tryin to find a little hon for some one-night love
'Stead you got another nigga all up in your mug
You make me uncomfortable thug, go thatta-way!
And kill the ice grill holmes
'Cause I keep enough heat to melt that away
I came in some sweats, I came to get met
Tryin' to find a chick that make it hard for me to ""next!""
We exit stage left, hop in her Lexus
Treat me like a baby, mouth on her breast-es
May I suggest that it's
A lot of long-legged chicks in short-ass dresses
Go find you one
Go get your dance on, go grind on one, damn
Go find you one
Go get your dance on, go grind on one

Quick question‚Äîyo, why you over here?
So many hoes in here
My office hours 9 to 5, whyon'tcha call me there

There's so many hoes in here
I understand you got issues but I really don't care
There's so many hoes in here

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Yeah yeah yeah I know you rap and your sister spit too
You been callin' the office and you can't get through
I understand all that, but now ain't the time
I came to the club to get that off my mind
And all you thugs with your war stories startin' to bore me
I ain't tryin' to hear about your guts and glory
I'm tryin' to hear B.I.G. and some cuts from N.O.R.E
And you keep talkin' over the beat like Clue (""Do you remember?"")
Go find somethin' to do
You're a janitor, go find somethin' to screw
Disappear like Copperfield, go cop a feel
Play hide and seek with yourself for real, huh
The chick came dressed up just to get messed up
She got her hair done, just to get it sweated up
Shit I'm tryin' to help her out
Whyon'tcha help me out and be out?
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Quick question‚Äîyo, why you over here?
So many hoes in here

3aLEfntwSTEM4xhv4OJSHR,A Ballad For The Fallen Soldier - Skit,"7 ContributorsLoaded Lux vs. Tsu Surf Lyrics[Round 1: Tsu Surf]
As the river flows, so goes the salmon

The good brother Jay-Z said
""There's a little nigga‚ÄÖsomewhere‚ÄÖright now eatin'‚ÄÖa bowl of Apple Jacks
And in‚ÄÖbetween eatin' the Apple Jacks he writin‚Äô raps and he‚Åüwant‚Åümy‚Åüspot.""
You should've felt‚Åüthat
Johnathan John, John
I‚Åüused to think y'all was battlin' on the roof
All the rumors, niggas jumpin'
Only Mortals bleed when it's combat (Kombat)
You see it's them, and then the others
He probably thinkin', ""Surf. Lil' bro.""
Boy I was watchin' you since I was splittin' lunches.""
Now a days I keep some schemes, wordplay
Them double entendres in abundance
I couldn't wait to get in Johnny Cage to start splittin' punches
Y'all God get nailed to a cross like soon as we cross him
Crucifixion, new razor, gut 'em like a fish or rip Johnny Gills with this New Edition
The difference between this and your last wars? Somethin' super different
You don't tell the truth to who need to hear the truth, you lie to who'll listen
Bein' real don't cost shit
Contradicting yourself cost a price or two
Twice my age, half my st-
Fuck would I take advice from you?
Only thing I ever considered takin'? Maybe a life or two
The pastor wanted me to get a grip
Go to church Lux? The pastor got vices too
But you and all this schizophrenic shit gon' hurt the kids
Grandma said, if a person got too many personalities, deep inside their self it hurt to live
You battled Mook dressin' as a drug dealer
Talked and moved like you do the trap
Then was Huey P versus Hollow, with a message, it was super black
12 rounds, beef and Cal (cow) pop made mistakes (mis-steaks) while movin' packs
But vegan Bruce Leroy versus Ars'- shit confusin' and super wack
You had on six t-shirts versus Clips
And it sound like you really really knew the rat
That's how innocent people get shot when they don't know who they shootin' at
Soooo
Black activist on some trappin' shit
That say that you a lost nigga if you package flip
But on stage with Bloods versus Verb, but on some pastor shit
Against usin' hollows and sippin' Actavis
But last battle used Hollow in a scheme sippin' Actavis
But everybody else a lost nigga
He even put a name to it
You know how many kids watch Hollow? Like all of his battles they bang to it
Y'all had a scheme that made it seem, Nigel was back sippin' lean
Well if the niggas with fame do it, what if a fan slip back in that Juice Wrld?
Man, that'll be plain (plane) stupid
So are you an activist?
Or did that round promote Actavis?
That's when I start fallin' back
Cause Huey P wouldn't tear down a brother if y'all was black
You got a talent, stupid, I wish we all could rap
He call it, ""talkin' to a lost nigga"" I call it whack
What he supposed to do when them nine applications ain't callin' back?
Everybody and got the lux-ury of callin' Smack
Starved til‚Äô one of them jobs call, Johnny that's a sick thing
Before my daughter starve I'm in somebody's shit tryin' to flip things
I can't make a move?
I gotta make somethin' move, you know, shift things
Or hit the ese's, my holmes (Mahomes) got in the Kansas City for 15
Before battle rap was payin'
I did whatever I had to do to be a father
Rest in peace black mamba
One time for 2G's, I let 24 out a chopper
There's kids back home takin' cold showers in my fuckin' hood
Watchin' you on YouTube actin' like you got powers in ya fuckin' hood
For you to be so fuckin' smart Lux, you seem so obsolete
Like you don't know I kill niggas outta respect, boy all my ops elite
You can't feel it in ya bones
You, you wasn't there-
You ain‚Äôt runnin' in these streets, you was doin' what you was 'pose to do
You can't feel it in ya bones with death near, get close to you
Dark room, shattered heart
I'm cryin' cause I wanted blood
Somebody ever try smokin' you?
I broke the bathroom mirror I can‚Äôt
Look at me emotional
When it's time to go it's time to go
I need niggas that's gonna stand us wit' us
You told Hollow, ""Stand up niggas don't lean.""
Lux we leaned on some stand up niggas
Ni-

[Round 1: Loaded Lux]
So for the audience that's joinin' in to watch Loaded Lux be dominant
You know there's more to battle rap when I'm rhymin' in
So I'ma just...space the bars out so you can screen the process of designin' this
Little nigga ain't fought nights (FortNite) I did
You'se a body, tryin' to out perform a computer scientist
Firin'
You gon' have trouble shootin' (troubleshooting) tryin' to plug into a situation you don't really even know why you're in (wirin')
Lyrically you outta touch but you just got the feel for this
Then I came along (a lawn) and mowed (modem) him down
Now let me bring you back online again
There's a message I'm tryin' to send
But with these settings you can't have them type conversations niggas like this able (disable) to comment in
What? You thought I was gonna come in here and positive?
You talk to motherfuckin' much man, that shit obvious
You got issues with it like a lobbyist
Now take a wild guess
Just another occupant, that couldn't cover up without me
Buildin' wit' the pen, ooooh, I'm still on top of this
Like fuck ya couch nigga
And back out on him like an ottoman
This the incompetent fool leadin' the new school?
You couldn't show a nigga the way hall monitorin'
And you got a followin'
How is this the narrative in the press page?
New era? Never!
Nigga you been in this shit longer than a decade
That's all document
What you chompin' at? No gossipin'
Skip the Face Off, rip his face off
Now, big mouth wanna watch his lip, got bustin'
All them cases, and wasn't no million dollar defense, I don't trust it
How you keep gettin' out, I don't get
Roc was just in the mix
Where was this shoot 'em up shit?
Top shotta with the grip, bitch you DJ Mustard
Yeah that solo record you got hit, you still gotta spin nigga
Cause if this is-
And you gettin' points for slidin'
Whatchu playin'? Air Hockey with them sticks?
Now that I think about it, that's makin' a lot of sense
Heard from some dudes you used to roller blade against
You was the skater kid, right?
Shotgun and Ars' told me how you got your name again
Yeah, takin' the street shit a little too out of hand
Oh you Electric wit' it, Slide on 'em
I mean your radius you was rankin' shit
Niggas 2K but you makin' this, I was thinkin' it
How the data fit?
You had me around 98%, that was 2 off, keep it 100, you think I'm sweet, I've got you covered though, I'm raisin' it
To the rim, blackin' when I put the grey thing on Raider stitch
That's Power, die cause you got in the way; Raina script
Im-Mortal in Kombat 'til that time that, heart check from Suge pushed your spirit all the way across the room; Raiden shit
No MTV, look what bein' fused with greatest get
I'm paintin' this picture to prove to all the critical dudes
Whatever one that you choose
I understand it
For the fans you got they vision confused in the original views
Where's the lyrical tools?
And I'm a mental hammer
Slammin' slanders until it chisel, chippin' off until a nigga thought patterns
Damage ya soul, dig in the wounds
You find somebody dope and you rope a rubber band around they arm and and hand them (Arm & Hammer) a syringe and a spoon
All issued with the platoon they click it and it boom
Just cause every line up you lick a (liquor) shot
Bar for bar you ain't even in the saloon, man give me some room
I get it, you bloom, but you just another lovely flower I pick
This dope how you plant it though
Cause now all the rest of papi (poppy) seeds saw you (soil) get grounded for this
We already knew this was a body
It's just the preacher got to say a few words before the ditch
Dearly beloved
We are NOT gathered here today...for bullshit
When a dead man plan that's usually a plot, right?
For the crypt, no
For the Crip, yeah
We came to see you off from the rip (R.I.P.)
Off the script, I never saw you get live but you on Live again
It's funny, I catches the time you and the guy from NWX was chimin' in
Conspirin', tryin' to spin the dialogue with the fake politics
Paint the narrative, pile of tricks for the power shift
You relyin' on lyin' against Lionz gets you laid with your alliances
See how I, pile (pal) it up for you, I mean since now y'all friends
Pause
But we from Harlem dawg
You don't jump on another nigga Wave and ride it in
This lame?
You can't reign (Rain) just cause you cry to win
I'm black Jesus, nothings changed, I'm still turnin' water into wine and men (whining men)
This shit a shame
Smack, what the assignment is?
Get the price I'm askin'
""For every nickle son (Nicholson)"" I'm Jack'ed in
No question
As (axe) I come through the door
Yeah K, these the rooms I do The Shining in
Heeeere's Johnny!
And all his friends
We're not buyin' it
Had to conference him
Ya confidence was sayin' ""Soldier""
That's what you sold us
And they got the one with Beyonce and them
The dance video, the camouflage and the Timbs
""I'm a 'Survivor'""
Watch niggas like this when they dolo
Not Gun Titles and them, nooo nooo
See I catch you when they be (B) solo and then you sure the Destiny Child'll end
""Lord! Why it had to be him?""
He believed in the hype from them
Surf's up
See, now you niggas is just goin' overboard with this shit
Yeah, no
Surf's up
He ain't givin' you the watered down truth
Fuck all that wild views
That don't prove you got the better rhymes
He handin' you fables
Then the plan to get disabled
Oh you signed?
Good, that provide more fans at the table
Watch you get punch drunk
He took shots, then put old Johnny in a Walker with the cane and get-
And you was just lookin' like the man on the label
Y-y-y-you know, on the bottle of Johnnie Walker it's the guy walkin' with the cane on the label
Say you niggas should really stop recording this
As I'm recalling him
Arms out, back pedalin'
I'm tryin' to show my son how to re-walk again
Man, this is already unfortunate
But I'd rather that, then me tellin' his family, ""It's fatal""
His dad wasn't there, I was just standin' in one day at a time
He come into Harlem, me and I.C.E. showin' him how to lay them rhymes
You gotta stand divine
Let me think...Coronavirus event, Popeye chicken sandwiches
Naaah bro, I still got the crazier lines
What up with the state of ya moms, huh?
When you come at the mountain climbin' on Roc(k) line
These niggas make me tickle
When you tag the team but that jazz (Jaz) they rappin' ain't official (O'fficial)
Look, look, look Roc, here's the game plan, nigga I ain't playin' witchu
{Beasley calls time on Lux}

[Loaded Lux]
He gon' Jersey outta this one
I be he would choke
Yo...go 'head go 'head go 'head
Yooo

[Round 2: Tsu Surf]
Mere fuckin' mortal,  you ain't no savage, stop it
I hope this pussy got nine lives
Who I'm kiddin' (kitten) this finna be cat-astrophic
The eyes of the soul usually holeless, you'd hate the view
Who said they'd want him in the grave like Liam Neeson?
Man, they soul will get Taken 2 (too)
I came to talk to Lux to talk to Lux
I can't respect it if it made to me
If anybody else try to pop out I swear to God I'm taking three (Taken 3)
I remember you sayin' word for word I was better than them lions then
Now Mr. Miyagi can't respect Daniel-san made a penthouse out of the Lionz Den
It's like everybody you preach to, you lie to 'em
Fraudin' on these cards like the rules to apply to him
Who you checkin' or savin'? I got a receipt sayin' I account for a lot of 'em
I can't bank on these reality checks or deposit 'em
The only nigga to survive Loaded, Clips and Hollow and a loaded clip with hollows
Brand new double revolvers
Twin spinners, captain of the Lost Niggas, nigga
My friends sinners
My handle Irving, Plaza on my back like Kyrie about, ten winners
Yeah it's cool to be Loaded, but if you point and don't shoot you Ben Simmons
Fuckin' vulture
I hate everything about you and that fake smile
You Loaded Lux the architect of this place? How?
Everybody ain't from the 3-1-3, where I'm from you get shake down
Before we made URL famous, you was only famous cause you ate Miles (8 Mile)
You came to URL when it was hot, nigga you wasn't made wit' us
Before the whips, before the chain, you ain't slave wit' us
Everybody know the backhand big, the fine print say, ""the grave bigger.""
Keep shovelin' for gold pussy, we only respect grave diggers
You got it confused, let's get somethin' straight
You started the game I added the Euro, up to date
Wanna be God? I will send you home, stay in ya fuckin' place
Never say behind your back what I can say in ya fuckin' face
You, Mook, the reason that man sold a couple DVD's in a couple states
Me and my top tier peers, we made the numbers fluctuate
Actin' like you bleedin' in the ring for this culture
You a wrestler, by the time you wanted to play ""King Dictionary"" we was already sellin' out Webster
Arsonal most viewed battler ever, if you do it that's how you 'posed to
Hitman, Con', Clips, they brought TV to the culture
I got 'em thinkin' battlers can make music
Sold out shows, signin' posters
You wasn't with us shootin' in the gym, but come around tryin' to coach us
In weird ass outfits and ya loafers
We caught all the kills and still left somethin' for the vultures
I told Smack he can multiple sums if he subtract the bad cattle
The difference is, he cool
You? We just glad to have you
The bite worse than the hiss, you pay attention to the rattle
I divided blocks for a fraction of what I get for these battles
So what's the problem?
Last nigga tried to give me some work, we robbed him, then shot him
The lost niggas I bodied remain lost 'til the cops find 'em
Can't put me under your Speed Stick
Beat it
The holster where I keep it
Holdin' 30 on a Degree, but somethin' in this arm ain't a Secret
Neither is what I do to you
If DNA can clap the machete, I can spray the Axe, there be Doves at your funeral
Check my resume, I'm certified I got all my stripes
Oh you ain't heard I bodied older (body odor) niggas all my life
Wood grain grip, split his head with mahogany
Dip or catch a Big Bang; astronomy
One shot, two shot, by the time I hit ten, 11th book; Deuteronomy
Alpo
Black Panther, I wish that shit'd stop
Every other battle contradiction is a different prop
I'm fightin' life battles, these battles, not hittin' ops
The judge said my homie would come home when pigs fly
We tried to hit a cop
I can tell by your name where you from
You around it but you don't really know it
My homie died with his gun on his hip and it was loaded
They say anything in battle cause it's battle rap
Call me a ""rat"" in real life and I'm shootin' lead
I'll a leave (Aleve) you where we left the last
We'll peel (pill) on anybody that said ""Tsu the Feds"" (Sudafed)
Why say ""been a drill"" (Benadryl) when you know the drill?
We 'bout stuff
Home makeovers, flip the house up
Lil' niggas, they get high off Percocets and that clout stuff
Just point 'em to the next kill and fed 'em mean (amphetamine) bags to keep they mouth shut
If trappin' took care of the crib, I don't care if niggas agree wit' me
I know the cons, but I be pro fiends (Ibuprofen) then they'll keep feedin' me
That was probably drugged out, sometimes I be stretchin' it
I'm just tryin' to show I can line a pen (Klonopin) with the best of 'em
[Round 2: Loaded Lux]
I won't even spit my third verse
Tell me you got caught up in the hype with this
Tell me you didn't expect this to get to the height that it did
I'll even go for, ""Big bro, you COVID hit, shit got slow
Wasn't no nights gettin' gigs
You know I like to pretend with this life that I live.""
Oh nigga just tell me
And I'll tell you what I might forgive
Damn Surf...and I'm a nigga that's gonna fight for the kids
You know, every time I see you on your Live and you vent
You remind me of when I first met you and you was nothin' to me but a fan of the live event
Still havin' problems with insecurities
You remember the problem...with security
You was a little more shier then
I gave them the Wave

[Lux looks to the crowd]
Yeah nah...he's- he's good. Yeah he's good

Nigga I try to help when I can
It's who I am
You know, I look at life in synchronicity and not serendipity so you're able to see the signs and it's symbolic when
I peep the state society in and now it's when the Wave went to go against the grain?
How ironic, this would explain
Why we in this change of environment
Oh it's all synonymous
The fact that less is more
So you Andre The Giant then, right?
And a big stage ain't nothin' but a WWF cage you put a bunch of fake fighters in
All the Madness is at an Ultimate high again
In spite of it, yeah, I gave you the play guide
Not for you to get around the rest of these little niggas and play God
No more play time
Days are numbers on a Jersey
Nigga who thought he was season is over
It's ya last dance to crossin' Jordan
Say, why is (wise) these niggas with no intelligence think they A.I
It's artificial, whatever he sell you
""You don't know about goin' to jail""
You tryin' to compare goin' in and out of cells to a nigga at a whole 'nother cellular level
The devil a lie!
My mother was in pain
You wanna speak to the inmate, press 9

[Surf]
Classic

[Lux]
I wasn't impressed by it
A nigga throwin' a party at the prison and puttin' his mother on the guest line
And yet y'all ooh'd and aah'd
And I'm confused like, ""Why is this even cool to y'all? To watch a nigga's stressed moms.""
This nigga's a flunky man
You don't drill, you just get caught keepin' steel
You'se a gummy, man
And they labelled the Boy Bad, but really what did he (Diddy) do
You've got to dance Puffy!
You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?
Smack, check ya dawg (dog)
He out here sayin', ""Surf ain't never scared.""
Yeah I hear, you don't tuck your tail at all
Grown man shi-
You really gotta solidify your position
Like, why is niggas even out here thinkin' you might've been snitchin'?
Is it cause ""allegedly"" you turned a life sentence into a light sentence?
Fuck, I gotta put it in subtitles or somethin'?
You gave a light sentence to avoid a life sentence
Well you know they say Ah di Boom was writin' this nigga's lyrics
Ohh, that's the part that got me kinda suspicious
Then you decided to get wit' a label
Under the table, low key, you might as well be signed to the system
When the company heads of it with hedge fundin' invest money into the privatizing of prisons
We ain't gotta guess cousin, of who's side is you wit' then
I look at your message youngin'
Kill niggas
Get high
You got shot
You see the vibe you is sendin'?
Type of rhetoric that's helpin' with multiplying convictions
It's a science to this shit, but right I be forgettin'
""We don't wanna hear that bullshit Shareff""

[Surf]
Not at all. Facts

[Lux]
Right
Then next week you gonna tell me how you rappin' so you can get up out the streets
You know what I'ma mind my business
Well make up your mind then little nigga
How many ""Free Surf"" shirts it's gon' take for you to finally get it
But mind you I get it
You tryin' to protect everything you got in this image
We from the same place
But you wanna come up in here makin' excuses of why you not makin' wiser decisions
And all the while you play ignorant
My son gotta dodge his condition
And I don't see the difference from a nigga like you and a cop puttin' his knee on his neck squeezin' the air outta his existence
Ahhh maaaan!
Not to mention all that police brutality was goin' on
Where was all the sticks that you got?
I bet' not hear another motherfuckin' gun bar from none of y'all gang niggas if it ain't gettin' at S.W.A.T
What?!
Oh, you never heard of it?
You-you say you a gangsta
You say you gotcha gat
You say, ""rat-a-tat-tat...TAT""
I never heard of it
Surf just kill yaself
Rest in peace to Khalid Muhammad
It's like y'all forgot
How you don't look at cops and see ops (C-ops)?
But you ask him it's, ""I'm just tryin' to get to this chicken""
Arroz con pollo
One track at a time, right?
""Yeah holmes""
We just gotta know his loco motives
Next they gon' tell you what ballad we should vote
Nigga you was only at a rally with them folks cause you had an album to promote
All loud, show steppin'
Fuck a march nigga
I get in this ring and do the protesting (pro-testing)
URL called me up talkin' 'bout, ""Lux-""

[Beasley calls time]

Awww man

[Round 3: Tsu Surf]
15 puttin' food on my mother table, shouldn't have been my business
But watchin' my mother struggle, I had to get out and get it
Locked up, detention centers turn into prisons
Judge said I could be locked up with content
""Your honor I don't know what that mean.""
She put it in a sentence
I heard a judge say-
I heard a white judge say, ""It ain't in God's hands. You go to prison when your honor ready.""
Type to go to jail, turn god body for protection and 5% of his commissary
I don't wanna hear 'bout bein' no boss nigga when you the type of nigga I boss
E'ry other battle is ""lost niggas""
I'd rather worry 'bout niggas I lost

{Surf bring it back 9 bars to the top of his round}

15 puttin' food on my mother table, shouldn't have been my business
But watchin' my mother struggle, I had to get out there and get it
Locked up, detention centers turn into prisons
Judge said I could be locked up with content
""Your honor I don't know what that mean.""
She put it in a sentence
If you ain't never been lost then save your two cents, bottom line
I be where the lost niggas at cause there's a couple mothafuckas that I gotta find
Judgin' me cause I'm from a war zone, there's war home, we can't move without 'em
Last Joker we caught on a Dark Knight Heath Ledger, we made a movie out him
Your mother still wanna know what you gonna do wit' ya life
Battlin' once a year for a career ain't the coldest
She only gettin' older
So much power in knowin' I could load this and take a load off her shoulders
I'm learnin' you battle rappers ain't never seen shit
Just write down whatever fit the situation and you scream shit
You really wear suits to these battles
Playin' with these people in these caskets
It was always a battle puttin' on them suits
I hated seein' them people in them caskets
Every time I look in this snake eyes I wanna shoot him in his open eye
Grip tight, trick dice
If we the ones rollin' then Loaded die

{Surf stumbles and starts to bring his round back 25 bars before picking up where he left off}

Can't tell me about bein' no lost nigga when you the type of nigga I boss
E'ry other battle a ""lost niggas""
I'd rather worry 'bout niggas I lost
...My little cuz was playin' ball but he play-play too
The ops caught cuz lackin' after A.A.U
It's like shit went backwards after cuz got popped
They said they heard, ""You! Aye! Aye!"" then never had a shot
We was thinkin' NBA, 6 feet at 17
But he died over C's (seas) you can rush a (Russia) mother to her stroke
Bury that baby six feet at 17
The killer got killed before we got a chance to kill him
What a bother
When you can't even the score you just gotta credit karma
Meditation and mountains how you get up in ya zone?
My last time in them mountains I was wishin' I was home
But his words so intricate, compelling, deep
Boy I'm right out my brain, new Dillinger
I'll Blow Johnny Depp right out his brain
You said, ""Harlem hospital givin' beds out""
That's usually what happen when the hammer dance
Where I'm from you die on the ground or a stretcher in the ambulance
They hidin' we seek 'em, tag him in his head
Hospital bed? Where we play, don't come back until he dead
Loaded alone, I send the goons, go in his home
Cut a leg off, skin his face, open his dome
Try to break the blade off when it go in his bone
Jack knife, Razor's edge, I'm goin' Ramon
And you separate the body, each pallbearer gotta carry a Load of his own
Big shoe
Nobody on the Planet fit in this (Fitness)
I'm cut different
MVP Giannis countin' Euros
The Buck different
DNA on the machine?
You wipe the shit down when you done wit' it
My shooter had the best rounds I ever heard, I felt 'em, but somethin' different
That last kill I caught in real life, I can't understand how his family hated me
I heard they wanted him closer to God, I figured they'd be thankin' me

{Surf cuts his round short}

Jersey

[Round 3: Loaded Lux]
They dropped the ball puttin' you on this card wit' me
This shit declinin'
It's been a hip hop breaching contract with the client
Rappers givin' rappers the license to care about doin' everything else, but rhymin'
You may wanna sue (Tsu)
You just wanna perform
But in what forum
When the crowd can't do it for him...not in this form
I don't know what neighborhood he been through
But this Beloved hood
The block party where street niggas shouldn't be barricading the route
To tell the truth
If I look over the rail and you can't meddle (metal) with me puttin' together bars
Well let's guard, dawg (dog)
You on the fence about it, I was already comin' outta the gate for your roof
Save me the, ""Thanks for the loot!""
Your hospitalable, y'all will get that soon
Ain't that right Surf?
You know all about bein' patient with rooms
Take it you do
Have faith and you grew
But battle rap is the new hustle
The kingpin had to wait on his mule
And I make sure you was nothin' but an 8 Ball on the corner pocket
With the stick tryin' angles (triangle) tryin' not to get chalked through your queue (cue)
We ain't in the same pool
You turned into a bikini model
You see we all had to shoot, you went and got cute
Nigga you PUSSY
I guess anybody with balls [?] but not on queue (Q)
Bishop, what about the Juice?
This an abortion kid
I'm cuttin' you off as I was fast forwardin' through the 'Tube
Lookin' at the dash bored (dashboard) like, ""This can't be the speed I'ma cruise
Shit a crash course
You was the NASCAR and I the fuel
I see what all the gas for, nigga you on fumes
Maybe that's why he asked y'all for the pullover
And I can't rest stop and think
Oh, now I gotta fix the nigga who claim he got all the power tools
Breakin' down soon
Is son (sun) outta his roof?
How else you gonna get out on me kiddie?
He locked in baby
Kiddie? Locked in?
The way Smack set up this child, proof
You can't handle this
Why you think I had to open up the door for you?
This shit's scandalous, man
This 30 I'ma doo rag him, no strings attached when you know it's a wrap, but he couldn't even tie this
Look what cousin combin' the block but wasn't brushin' up on the sides get
Silver linings
You misread the goal and blew it
It was all in ya head that they colored you bad
Well it's a good day for dyin'
I'm still firin'
Beyond the best
You lose battles but win the popularity contest
It's gotta be addressed
This ain't nothin' but a dead man gettin' suited
Whatchu 'bout a gentleman's 30?
Yeah I gotchu
Custom
Up to the neck
Don't ask Surf how he feel about battle raps, he in here with me, ain't he?
Aw man, a nigga love it to death
Boo!
Scary nigga
You gettin bodied losin', just like a ghost, invisible cloak
You can act like you started with SMACK
Niggas know the heart of battle rap, wrap ribbons and bows around your gift and presented it like a host
Your mission a hoax
You trace, copy then paste the blueprint that I wrote
You know why you can do numbers and talk digital scrolls?
It's sorta how the pryamid grows
It's all knowledge
See at the base column it's a lot of people at the bottom
But yeah it gets slimmer as it goes
What you did? Summer Madess 1, right?
Then after that, ""You Gon' Get This Work"" the biggest of quotes
I had the whole industry sendin' me tweets via Twitter with notes
Kendrick and Cole, I even got Jigga to post
Best Flex freestyle EVER!
Comparin' ya I-95 shit is a joke
You wrote a book?
I am the book, nigga
You can't change history bro
The moral of the story is...my body of work nigga will BODY ya work
Stop confusing a bunch of activities with results
You makin' money don't make you a man
You can have millions and ya spirit be broke
But niggas will know
When this same ole' Crip you niggas thought was Rainbow Six
Turns out to be Tekashi at the end of the road, nigga
I am a prisoner revolt
I'm tryin' to crack the cell wall and get to ya soul and dig in the vault
Oh you can get you some votes
Nigga I can give you the volts
From the infinite
Field
Now a nigga feels when I push they inner will (wheel) to the rim when I spokes
Streets ain't give you nothin' back but a hard time little bro
Nigga own up
Shit funky
But you gon' look at me and turn ya nose up
I guess you just gon' keep up this persona
Like the news do with the Corona
Fully Loaded
They tried to jump the gun
First Surf threw, the contective punch
He set up to punt
I got pregnant with joy
I felt the shit he be kickin' is just a bump
I've got another son
Punk you'se a warm up
I've got somethin' else in the oven bun
And it's about to see the daylight (Daylyt)
Yeah baby
You've been pushin' for this
And you gon' get it in the months to come
......Little nigga you still here? Whatchu want?

A newspaper, look out boy, and get ya chips up
Or get a gun, a mask, an escape route
Some ducktape'll make 'em take you to the house
And ma don't give him nothin', unless he's treatin' you special
Soon he'll get desperate, and go down and bless you
And when he come up for air, with a mouth full of hair
Just grab your coach bag and get the fuck outta there, yeah

Look, think big, fuck gettin' your nails done

If you with me, throw the diamond up one time

Niggas, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside

[Verse 1]
Now what the fuck they gon' do with me?
Got money, got broads, got a crew with me
Real as banana clips, I got a zoo with me
Get down or lay down, nigga, to shoot with me
Now how the fuck they gon' deal with me?
I ain't going nowhere, they gotta deal with me
Got the whole BK ready to kill with me
You scared, motherfucker? Keep it real with me, keep it real with me
Now what the fuck they gon' say to me?
Got to clap, ya mean? All day with me, clap, ya mean?
Don't play with me, clap, ya mean?
Stay with me, don't lose me, y'all
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different
I bought it back for a living
Thirty-three O's on a bitch back like Pippen
Three she can keep for herself and distribute
Thirty-six O's and a ki', you do the addition

Thank you, thank you, thank you, please hold your applause
For I just applied logic‚Äîkeys, keys open doors
Now I'm balcony, opera, black tux, binocular
Black Luxe, stop it, I shouldn't be so popular
Name keep poppin' up, face keep poppin' up
On the tube, I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up
How would I know HBO would get a shot of us?
Sittin' so close that we almost got snot on us
Please don't bow in my presence‚Äîhow am I a legend?
I just got ten #1 albums, maybe now eleven?
More hits than a Now 11; that is no reason
To treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes
Thank God, what a guy, as I say my grace!
Who woulda thought by makin' birds migrate for the winter
I be fly all summer? Might I say

I was gon' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales
I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help
And they did a good job, them boys is talented as hell
'Cause not only did they brick, they put a building up as well
Then ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar, then took a smell
'Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills

This is anti-Auto-Tune, death of the ringtone
This ain‚Äôt for iTunes, this ain't for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct (Uh)
This might offend my political connects (Uh)
My raps don‚Äôt have melodies
This should make niggas wanna go and commit felonies (uhh!)
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn (Uhh!)
I know we facing a recession
But the music y'all making gon' make it the Great Depression (uhh!)
All your lack of aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set, men (uhh, uhh!)

This ain't a number one record (uhh!)
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon (uhh!)
I made this just for Flex and... Mister Cee
I want niggas to feel threatened (uhh!)
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light (That's too far, nigga!) (uhh, uhh!)
I might wear black for a year straight (uhh!)
I might bring back Versace shades (uhh!)

[Intro: Rihanna & Jay Z]
Feel it comin' in the air (Yeah)
Hear the screams from everywhere (Yeah)
I'm addicted to the thrill (I'm ready)
It's a dangerous love affair (What's up? Come on)
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now (What's up?)
Only thing that's on my mind (What's up?)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (Ah, what's up?)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (Yeah, what's up? Yeah)
We gon' run this town

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up

Microphone fiend, this the return of the god
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin', ""Fuck the other side! They jealous!""
We got a banquette full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in 'cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like Millionaires' Row

I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I‚Äôm in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life Good Will Hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels""
""Is that a May‚Äî what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels""
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill

Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (D√≠melo)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say ""What up?"" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out (Come on), I could trip a referee (Come on)
Tell by my attitude (Come on) that I'm most definitely from

Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""

Three dice, Cee-lo, Three Card Monte

Or they could step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA (Come on) got you feelin' like a champion (Come on)
The city never sleeps (Come on), better slip you a Ambien

You ready? You ready Hov'?
Let's go! (Hands up!)

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
At the same time re-introduce my wealth
At the same time rejuvenate the game
It's for my old dawg niggas that's used to 'caine
Now what my B-dog said? I respect the game
GD's, Vice Lords, the Crips the same
And I know y'all 'bout to say this off the chain
Tell 'em fake trappin' ass niggas stay out my lane
See I ain't dead or in jail, I can't complain
And when these fake niggas gone, I shall remain
And if you just tunin' in, let me explain
You know I keep that 47, Uday Hussein
These niggas way too far, I played the game
And if you listen hard enough, I say some things
And when that sack got low, I shave them things
And put 'em right back together, I made them things

[Chorus: Jeezy & Jay-Z]
Now put your sets in the air if you represent your clique
Money in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby
Put your hands in the air if you know that you that bitch
Say you looking for the real? Hey, well this is real as it gets

These other boys lyin', I wonder if y'all care
They stories out this world, I wonder if y'all hear
But don't really matter as long as they stay clear
Clear of the real shit we doin' over here
When my nigga get home, I'm gon' send him a Lear
For all the time he been down, get him right up in the air
With a couple of broads, get him right up in the air
Mile high club, get him right up in there
Send my nigga some gear like he never missed a year
By the time you hear this song, he'll be standin' right here
Real nigga shit there

At a snail's pace, I won this race that y‚Äôall trail
Uh, uh, Blueprint's for sale
Followin' my footprints you can't fail
Set sail, I used to duck shots but now I eat quail
I'll probably never see jail
Each tale contains more of the truth
Of the statute allows me to go into detail
Uh, close your eyes, you can smell
Hov's the audio equivalent of braille
That's why they feel me in the favelas in Brazil
And Waterhouse 'cause real recognize real
Rrrah!

[Verse 4: Jeezy]
You know me, I don't need no introductions
Call me, make a lil' somethin' out of nothin'
Anywhere you go, we the topic of discussion
Damn, that's gotta be disgusting
Ugh, shit make you wanna throw up
This is big boy music, this should make you wanna grow up
Flows like syrup, it just make me wanna pour up
And is it just me or this makes you wanna roll up
A big fat one, then unpack one
Then unwrap one, peel back one
They use to call me Jizzle with the stamp in the middle
And you can tell the color when it's damp in the middle
Wassup!

T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y‚Äôall remind me of us in early '92 (Uh-huh)
Outkast landed, 3-thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ovay', ayy
[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & Jay-Z]
Every day, a star is born
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day, a star is born (Uh-huh, Jay)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
And I am one of one
Can‚Äôt you see just how long my run?
My reign, Lulu's son-shine
Been a star since I was ducking one-time
One time, give it up for him
December 4th, a star was born
Clap for him! He went from moving that corner
To this corner office, it's so enormous
Hey!
Prez' Carter watching her get her Monica on all day
Hey, got so many different monikers, but only one Jay
They come, they go
Some real, some faux
Some friends, some hoes
But, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov'
[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & Jay-Z]
Every day a star is born (And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born (And you say New York City! Uh-huh, yeah)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
[Verse 4: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far-away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad daylight‚Äîgo figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real lifesaver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him!
Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick, thought he wrote the rap for him‚Äîno, sir!
The flow cold as the shoulders of gold-digging hoes when a broke nigga 'proaches
Told you I‚Äôm focused, man
I‚Äôll let you motherfuckers soak it in, and clap for 'em!

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams, Jay-Z, & J. Cole]
Every day, a star is born (And you say New York City!)
Yeah, hey, and clap for 'em!
Hey, hey, and clap for 'em!
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em!
I'm here now! Fayettenam

If Hov's a Blackberry Bold, then shorty is a Sidekick
She used to have a man; I used to have a side-chick
Shorty got wind; I had to blow the chick off
She got rid of him; they both took the shit hard
Shorty played the piano; me, I played with white keys
Shorty from the South‚Äîoh, I think she like me
Shorty like Pac; me, Big Poppa
She screaming, ""Hit 'em up!"" I'm screaming ""Who shot ya?""
I'm on that red wine; shorty like white
Same shit, different toilet; we both getting nice
Me, I'm from the Apple, which means I'm a Mac
She's a PC: She lives in my lap

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyonc√©]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Whether black or white, we both like Mike
We both like Jordans, we both Phil's Knight
I finish my breakfast, shorty's out to lunch
Yeah we both eating, it's better than brunch
Shorty like Pepsi, me I'm the coke man
Body like a Coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can
Started at the window, end up at the wall
The Yin to my Yang, I skeet skeet off
In a salt and pepper 'Bach, shorty like to front
The Bonnie to my Clyde, both riding shotgun
Both covered in gold like C3P0
James and Florida Evans, let the good times roll

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Thought shorty was the truth, found out she was a cheater
We were supposed to take over, I caught her bumping ""Ether""
I thought shorty liked Mike, found out she liked Prince
Thought she was Adrian, it's been rocky ever since
My dollars was down, she left me for some Euros
Took my whole flavor, I call her Coke Zero
We were co-MVP's like Kobe and Shaq
Left me for the Heat, we were winning back to back
Said I party too much, shorty got fed up
Shorty got Britney, shaved her whole head up
We used to make out, kissing each other's face off
Fell for the Ponzi scheme, damn shorty just made off

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyonc√©]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard

A man I worked for had one of the biggest in New York
He didn't own his own company, a White man owned it, so they owned him
Nobody owns me though
Your gangster is not defined (Your gangster is not defined)
Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist
But more how your genes stand up to their expectations
""Never forgetting where we came from""
Your gangster, your gangster
Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch
But rather how many rocks you move while owning watch
Gangsters, hustlers, republicans and democrats, pimps and hoes
Conservatives, labour
The seller, the buyer, the product, the producer
""See you are what you are in this world""
The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern the gangsterment
Gangsterment, gangsterment
Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws
And create brand new words, gangster mentality
Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white
Mastered by the black, and absorbed by the fiends
Taxed by the governmentality, governmentality (Governmentality)
Charted by Forbes, if you believe in JAY-Z
Then you too can be a gangster (Then you too can be a gangster)
By any means necessary, by owning that dream
I mean it's a long walk to freedom
But, while deep, deep, deep inside the bush
The war on terror screams, damn it feels good
Damn it feels good to be a gangster, haha
To be a gangster, swagger is not a must, it's a liability
A clich√©, a bad suit, cut the bullshit (Cut the bullshit)

Meets the‚Åübusiness mind of‚ÅüMotown's Berry Gordy
Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry, my jewelry's so gaudy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauris
America, meet the gangster, Shawn Corey
""Hey, Young World,"" wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes, and you can pretend you're m–µ
I'm cut from the cloth of the Kenn–µdys
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed Black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence
As the incense burn
And the turntables turn and that Al Green plays
I see my mother's afro
As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's
And my papa just left the house
In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm her nerves
As I observe, this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store, we can never be sure
So all we can do is pray

Because of your strength
While I walked upon thee
For God is my defense
Pray for me!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
As I head to my homeroom
I observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground
I hear a car go, ""Vroom""
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle
I ask, ""Why you laugh?"" They say, ""You're too little""
""One day, you'll understand when you become a man
About things you have to get you""
Fast-forward, freeze-frame on my pistol
Fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
Around here, it's the shit that you just do
I just left school
The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had their guns drawn, screaming, ""Just move!"" (""Don't move!"")
""Or is there something else you suggest we can do?""
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like, ""Huh?""
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt, he calls paying dues
Now, when the rules is blurred‚Äî
As they is and were‚Äîwhat am I to do?
But pray? Pray the Lord forgive me
Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through
Pray
[Break: Beyonc√©]
Deliver me in thy righteousness
And cause me to escape
And climb thine air unto me
Save me thine Lord (pray for me!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Geah... Anywhere there's oppression
The drug profession flourishes like beverages, refreshing
Ahh! Sweet taste of sin
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg
What came first? Moving chickens or the egg?
This is why I be so fresh
I'm tryna beat life 'cause I can't cheat death
Treat shame with shamelessness
Aim stainlesses at anuses
You know the game this is?
Move coke like Pepsi, don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
I'm not an angel, I'm sure
But every night before I lay, I drop my knees to the floor
And I pray

[Outro: Beyonc√©]
The name shall endure forever
The name shall be continued as long as the sun
Pray for me!
Men shall be blessed in Him
All nations shall call Him blessed
In Your name, I pray
Pray for me!

Uhh, uhh!
This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Bimmers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I‚Äôm just a lazy boy
Day dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Uh, uhhhh!
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
It's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No!
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus, I‚Äôm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, it‚Äôs all in the stars
Like Tony La Russa on how you play your Cards
'Cause y‚Äôall ain't fucking with me! The ironies are
At all costs better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles it‚Äôs a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again

And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming

Guess what I'ma call h–µr? Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you
'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much, I bought extra
So much so that dinner's now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul

Liver bad, he wouldn't live long, that snatched my dad back
Guidance? I never had that, streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all
Burnt it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at
Flash back, not having much, not having that
Had to get some challah bread so you can holla back and
Holla at my Jewish lawyer to enjoy the fruit of letting my cash stack
And just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Own boss, own your masters, slaves
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon' feed we?
If I need it, I'ma get it however, God help me

Her fear, her youngest son be a victim of homicide
But I gotta get you outta here momma, or I'ma die

And either way, you lose me, Mama, so let loose of me
I got the rein, our direction will soon change
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game
Hustle 'caine, hustle clothes, or hustle music
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick

Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in

If I would have grew up to be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same (same, same...)
But since I grew up through the game
And my influence is the same
And my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed (ashamed...)
And though I wish I could separate the two things
I cannot so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearing th–µ coast up
Tight coupes like I'm wearing th–µ roadster
For any coupe, bear-hugging the holster

Shall we dance with the devil for a beat

Hehe
Y'all niggas got me really confused out there
I make ""Big Pimpin'"" or""Give It 2 Me,"" one of those, y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought-provoking shit, y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one
Follow!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block, then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged, then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
""That's him!""‚ÄîI'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount
'Cause I been doing this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada baggin' up at the Ramada
Table full of powder, A/C broke
'Bout to take another shower, on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the fight
You might see me anywhere, a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no sixes on Sprees
Laid-back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me

They're all actors
Lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themselves
Don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures
It's mostly backwards
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song, you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa!
This ain't B.R., no
It's S.C., CEO, the next Lyor
No, the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel‚Äîgo!

Ugh, take off the cuffs, unlock the gate
It's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate

Tell a trick, get these nuts, eat dick like food
Now see if I care if this verse get aired
Even if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah
I'm so raunchy, bitch, get off me
Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I missed the part when it stopped being 'bout Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit?
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Are you saying what I'm spitting is worse than these celebretantes showin' they kitten? You kidding?
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me

Then ask: ""Why is life worth living?""
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den
Take everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in

When I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like:
""Sorry, God, I lied, but give me one more try"" (try)
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is
Can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night, see how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?

Under your breath like you knew this day was coming (fallin')

Then it gotta be more; y'all left your paws
Footprints on the game, hood ain't been the same
Feeling ain't been in music, hooks ain't been the same
But I'm doing what I can, man, tryna follow y'all down memory lane, man
Big, you'd be ashamed to see New York gang bang
Pac, you'd feel the same thing, they use your name in vain
But I guess that's the issue
And it proves how much niggas really miss you
[Outro: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
Pun we missing you, Big L we missing you
Left Eye we missing you, Jay we missing you
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, (Yea) the list goes on
The world is missing you, the hood is missing you
(Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you) Know I mean?
Miss y'all (I miss you)
This goes, to the memory of all our fallen soldiers
Soldiers and soldiettes
All across the world (I miss you)
We gon' hold y'all down
Y'all living in our memories forever
Never gon' let y'all go

[Bridge: Aaliyah] + (Jay-Z)
I can't be no more (We not remembering your death, though)
Since you went away I don't really feel like talking (We celebrating your life, know I mean?)
No one here to love me, baby do you understand me? (Yes, yes)
I can't do a thing without you (Yes)
(Damn, we missing you)

[Hook: Aaliyah]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes

Deliver me from my enemies, oh God
Defend me from all that rise up against me
Deliver me from the work of iniquity
And save me from the Bloody Men

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Look, mind state of a gangster from the 40s
Meets the business mind of Motown's Berry Gordy
Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry, my jewelry's so gaudy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauris
America, meet the gangster Shawn Corey
""Hey, Young World,"" wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes and you can pretend you're me
I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedys
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed Black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence
As the incense burn
And the turntables turn and that Al Green plays
I see my mother's afro
As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's
And my papa just left the house
In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm her nerves
As I observe, this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store, we can never be sure
So all we can do is pray

Because of your strength
While I walked upon thee
For God is my defense
Pray for me!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
As I head to my homeroom
I observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground
I hear a car go, ""Vroom""
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle
I ask, ""Why you laugh?"" They say, ""You're too little""
""One day, you'll understand when you become a man
About things you have to get you""
Fast-forward, freeze-frame on my pistol
Fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
Around here, it's the shit that you just do
I just left school
The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had their guns drawn, screaming, ""Just move!"" (""Don't move!"")
""Or is there something else you suggest we can do?""
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like, ""Huh?""
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt, he calls paying dues
Now, when the rules is blurred‚Äî
As they is and were‚Äîwhat am I to do?
But pray? Pray the Lord forgive me
Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through
Pray
[Break: Beyonc√©]
Deliver me in thy righteousness
And cause me to escape
And climb thine air unto me
Save me thine Lord
Pray for me!

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Geah... Anywhere there's oppression
The drug profession flourishes like beverages, refreshing
Ahh! Sweet taste of sin
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg
What came first? Moving chickens or the egg?
This is why I be so fresh
I'm tryna beat life 'cause I can't cheat death
Treat shame with shamelessness
Aim stainlesses at anuses
You know the game this is?
Move coke like Pepsi, don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
I'm not an angel, I'm sure
But every night before I lay, I drop my knees to the floor
And I pray
[Outro: Beyonc√©]
The name shall endure forever
The name shall be continued as long as the sun
Pray for me!
Men shall be blessed in Him
All nations shall call Him blessed
In Your name, I pray

Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all, baby

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & JAY-Z]
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
But there's always‚Äî that's all, that's all, baby (Uh, uh)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Bimmers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Daydreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama, forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas is starving
Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snid-ow the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clid-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
And it's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah, got a connect? No
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, it's all in the stars
It's like Tony La Russa on how you play your cards
'Cause y'all ain't fucking with me, the ironies are
At all costs, better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles, it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up, Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins

Step one in this process, scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince 'em that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow 'cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
Now in the game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well‚Äî hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself

You could see from behind, you could redefine

Like a mama, you birth me; Brooklyn, you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley
They said you'd murk me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello, Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'ma call her? Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you
'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much, I bought extra
So much so that dinner's now turned into breakfast

Hello, Brooklyn, what's your story?
She said she eating on the run, but she ain't Nore'

And I'ma leave it like this‚Äîlike this, like that
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Have you seen her?
And when she tell you something, you better believe her
She told me she like my New Orleans demeanor
And so, I said, ""Goodbye, Katrina""

""Most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work, family, never forgetting where we came from.""

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Poor me, Dad was gone, finally got my dad back
Liver bad, he wouldn't live long, that snatched my dad back
Guidance? I never had that, streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all
Burnt it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at
Flash back, not having much, not having that
Had to get some challah bread so you can holla back and
Holla at my Jewish lawyer to enjoy the fruit of letting my cash stack
And just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Own boss, own your masters, slaves
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon' feed we?
If I need it, I'ma get it however, God help me

[Refrain: Jay-Z]
And I don't need no hook for this shit

[Verse 2]
I'm so fa sho', it's no fa√ßade
""Stay out of trouble,"" Mama said as Mama sighed
Her fear, her youngest son be a victim of homicide
But I gotta get you out of here momma, or I'ma die
Inside
And either way, you lose me, Mama, so let loose of me
I got the rein, our direction will soon change
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game
Hustle 'caine, hustle clothes, or hustle music
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick
Skinny nigga, toothpick, but, but I do lift
Weight like I'm using 'roids
Rolls-Royce, keep my movements smooth while maneuvering
Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in
Choices we make trying to escape, 'scape

[Verse 1]
Sweeeet... and still there's pain (pain, pain, pain...)
If I would have grew up to be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same (same, same...)
But since I grew up through the game
And my influence is the same
And my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed (ashamed...)
And though I wish I could separate the two things
I cannot so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearing the coast up
Tight coupes like I'm wearing the roadster
For any coupe, bear-hugging the holster

[Chorus]

And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)

Ordered some Patreezy, while talking to this breezy
Brushing off my three-piece, I make this look too easy
So tall and lanky, my suit, it should thank me

Mixed with Lucky Lefty, gangster effortlessly
Papa was a rolling stone, it's in my an-ces-try
I'm in a whole 'nother league, niggas never catch me
And I sport fly shit, I should win the ESPY

Hehe
Y'all niggas got me really confused out there

I make some thought-provoking shit, y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one
Follow!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block, then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged, then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
""That's him!""‚ÄîI'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount
'Cause I been doing this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada baggin' up at the Ramada
Table full of powder, A/C broke
'Bout to take another shower, on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the fight
You might see me anywhere, a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me

They're all actors
Lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themselves
Don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures
It's mostly backwards
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song, you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa!
This ain't B.R., no
It's S.C., CEO, the next Lyor
No, the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel‚Äîgo!

Ugh, take off the cuffs, unlock the gate
It's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate

Now see if I care if this verse get aired
Even if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah
I'm so raunchy, bitch, get off me
Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I missed the part when it stopped being 'bout Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit?
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Are you saying what I'm spitting is worse than these celebretantes showin' they kitten? You kidding?
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'

Suede in the rain, I'm sorta kinda the same

Y'all ain't give me forty acres and a mule
So I got my Glock 40 now I'm cool
And if Al Sharpton is speaking for me
Somebody give him the word and tell him I don't approve

What do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
'Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big
I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious

I'm way too important to be talking about extorting
Asking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin
Broad daylight I'll off your on-switch
You're not too bright, goodnight, long kiss
Bye bye, my reply... ""BLAH, BLAH""

Truth be told I had more fun when I was piss-poor
I'm pissed off, and this what success is all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out
All of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out
I mean, I like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu?
Hold up, let me move my bowels
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys
(Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!)
I got watches I ain't seen in months
Apartment at the Trump I only slept in once
Niggas said Hova was over, such dummies
Even if I fell I'll land on a bunch of money
Y'all ain't got nothing for me

Nas, let that bitch breathe!

[Verse 3: Nas]
Success, McLaren, women staring
My villain appearance
Sacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello
Camaro driven, I climax from paper
Then ask: ""Why is life worth living?""
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den
Take everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in
Up your catalog, dog, mine's worth too much

American dream, I'm living the life still
Way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining
40 below Timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friend's gone
I seen bad days, still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on
I hear his voice in my mind like, nigga live on
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
I'm give it to my sons
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh
Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame
A list of hits next to all my names
I came

(Woo!) uh-huh (geah)
I want the sky baby
I want the sky baby

[Verse 2]
If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose on the house
And auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the Beamer
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardinia
In Ibiza, I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
Billie Jean, the goddamn boy ain't mine
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Rose gold, Ros√© flow, I'm okay though
What don't kill me makes stronger than before so
Here we go and I'm not Domino
When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw
I might break but I don't fold, 'til I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah, that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture, ture
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
My name will be viewed as such
Here's to the man who refused to give up
I want the sky nigga, chuuurch

7mfjI5W7kW4owTUbuCUBrw,The Prelude,"70 ContributorsThe Prelude Lyrics[Intro: Pain In Da Ass]
You know, you've got this fantasy in yo' head about
Gettin' out of the life and setting the corporate world on its ear
What the fuck you gonna do except hustle?
Besides pimpin', you really ain't got the stomach for that

[Verse: Jay-Z]
The game's fucked up, nigga's beats is bangin', nigga, your hooks did it
Your lyrics didn't‚Äîyour gangsta look did it
So I would write it if y'all could get it
Bein' intricate'll get you wood, critic
On the internet, they like, ""You should spit it""
I'm like, ""You should buy it, nigga, that's good business"" Haha
Forget this rap shit, I need a new hustle
A little bit of everything, the new, improved Russell
I say that reluctantly, 'cause I do struggle
As you see, I can't leave, so I do love you
But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper
In fact, you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper
Back when crack was what these pills are
I was a real star
Complete with real cars, no video ones
You can come and set up a camera, let the video run
And my real life complete with real ice
VVS boulders all invisibly set
Head and shoulders, my invisible neck
You see, Hova wasn't digital yet
Before Steve Jobs made the iPod
Was getting head jobs, we call that ""interneck""
Back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette
With a automatic weapon I was rappin' with a TEC
Fresh like Mannie be, chain like anti-freeze
Shoebox full of cash, dealer-man hand me keys
Pantries full of Arm & Hammer
Don't take Nancy Drew to see what it do, I'm a damn G (Ugh)
Just sent a million dollars through a hands-free
That's big money talk‚Äîcan you answer me?
Before the answer was a three
I was down in Georgetown with a Hoya chick, lawyer chick
Sure, he's rich now 'cause he saw the shit, all this shit
That's why they call him Hov, 'cause he came before all this shit
Bought a six, quarter seven, skipped on them quarter eights
Bought a nine for nonstop Glock work all the time (Woo!)
Guess who's back
Since this is a New Era, got a fresh, new hat
Ten-year veteran, I've been set
I've been through with this bullshit game, but I never can
I used to think rappin' at 38 was ill
But last year alone, I grossed 38 mil'
I know I ain't quite 38, but still
The flow so special, got a 38 feel
The real is back

You are tuned in
To the greatest
Young H-O-V
Let's go get 'em again, Just
(Oh my God, HOV)

[Verse 1]
Pops sped off, left mom with a bundle of
Joy, ya boy smacked dab in the jungle
Took tunnel vision, but he would soon become a mogul
But first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo
Don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood
First niggas hating on me, it's all good
I'm buying things like my shit don't stink, Gucci links and Gucci gooses
Watching too many movies, bulletproof this
Had some nerve, like pulling tooth'ses
When you're 16, coming through roofless
Yea your boy ""ruthless"", like Ice Cube was
Turn the whole city on, I'm the new plug
So if this is your first time hearing this
You're about to experience someone so cold
A journey seldom seen, the American dream
From the bottom to the top of the globe they call me Hov

[Chorus]
They gunning for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Now I'm knee deep in the concrete
Like a street's made a quicksand, it's beyond deep
I got a ""chemical romance"", two left feet
So now I dance with the devil, please G-O-D
Save me from the ""black parade"", release me
My life like Grand Theft Auto, PSP
I'm in that Volvo, puffing on that la-la
Ducking from the po-po, every time I drive by
Say hi to the bad guy, all my momma's friends was like
""Mmm, mmm, mmm"" would you just look at him
So sorry dear momma for your embarrassment
But give me a couple years and pray I'll never sin again
Got all these rival dealers trying to do me in
And all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them I am (I am)
I'm feeling like the world's against me Lord
Call me crazy, but strangely I love the odds

[Chorus]
They gunning for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov)

[Verse 3]
Now these baby ballers, toy rappers
Callin out my name to bring the boy backwards
Shooting air-balls at the basket
What you call money, I pay more in taxes
I got crowned king down in Africa
Out in Nigeria, do you have any idea
Sold out shows out in Seoul, Korea
Jo'burg, Dublin, Tanzania
Lunch with Mandela, dinner with Cavalli
Still got time to give water out to everybody
Everybody, fall back
Y'all rapping, I'm reenacting
CNN, you see it's accurate
ESPN, see me in action
Monday night's, when the half ends
When you 10 years in, holla back then
[Chorus]
They gunning for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov)

I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P
Without the boy H.O.V
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, I'm ready
When kingdom come I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Now everywhere I go they like HOV come back
Up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and yeah glory to God
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I, take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth, Superman is alive

I hear ""hurry up Hov'"" when I'm out in the public
'Cause niggas like: ""but you love it; you be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas""
Had to dust off the Hammer dance, can't touch this
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
'Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinkin'
I thought dude's remark was rude okay
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Ros√©
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel 'em from the bottom
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
Peter Park', Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts
[Chorus]
The King of New York, New York
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, uh huh
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

[Verse 3]
Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
Guess what New York, New York - we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South
Bout it, bout it, Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homie Bun B
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
I repeat, sing along with me
I run the streets, the streets don't run we
Ladies saying ""Where you been Superman?""
When niggas spending ten million in media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear
When you need me just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah!

The King of New York, New York
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

I'm just getting better with time, I'm like Opus One
Young, no two alike like a snowflake
Okay, show me what you got babe
Words is slurring, engine purring

Mami in the zone like the homie two-three
Jordan or James, makes no difference
We all ballin' the same
Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recordin'
Nigga, you might want to fall back from recordin'
Shit, what you write is not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave they may applaud him
But misery, I will assure them

Uh, uh (You feel me?)
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so? Make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though, I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one

I don't think it's meant to be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth to be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z]
Lose, one, let go to get one (One, one, one)
Get one, lose some to win some
One, one, one, oh yeah, she lost one

My nephew died in the car I bought
So under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it
