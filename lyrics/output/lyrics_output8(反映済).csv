I can't express myself, don't know how to start
That's why I'm double cupped up, I go to Mars
Shawty was with me in the bando from the start
Now we in the Phantom, lookin' at the stars
When all this money came, these hoes played on me
I remained the same nigga, so please don't change on me
A lot of these hoes round a nigga, they be too fake
'Cause a young nigga been hoppin' out that new Wraith

[Verse 1]
All these problems got me drownin' in my codeine
Double up, the birds got me trappin' out them four wings
24/7, I just want you to be honest with me
You protected cause I keep the 9 under me
All them late night conversations in the loft
Didn't had to tell you, you knew we was gonna ball
But I've been havin' to explain to these hoes, gotta get off me
VVS diamonds in your ring, no Charles Barkley (Ayy)
I just got a number one rule, shawty don't lie to me
If you want a bad bitch in the threesome, we can find her
I'ma keep you flooded and on fleek in that designer
You know we be chasin' that bag, I'm right behind her

[Chorus]
I can't express myself, don't know how to start

Stayed loyal to these niggas, looked around and they ain’t here
Cut yourself out the circle, nigga tell me how it feel

Had to cut my main bitch off, she wasn’t down for real
Tried to infiltrate the circle, he out of bounds for real
A lot of these niggas ain't down for real

[Verse 1]
Would you put down on my books if I was trapped behind that wall?
Just get trapped up in the jam, see how many niggas call
That's why I don't fuck with niggas, only bad bitches
Where was you at, nigga, when I was doin’ bad, nigga?
Now these niggas flood around, 'cause I got diamonds on my neck
Only fuck with loyal niggas, told my dawg to cut the check
I cut that bitch if she ain't comin' correct
'Cause I got too many bitches to even stress
Tell my dawg to get that TEC, like Ron Artest (Brrt, brrt)
These niggas trap and then they ball for like half of the game
Made a profit with his dawg, then spent half on a chain

I got to pour me a four inside another liter
Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was ducking them people
Ducking them birds sending out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I'm dripping water nigga, Aquafina
Damn that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I got to leave her

Young nigga pullin' up inside the Bentley truck
I just be poppin' shit like hot grease

'Bout to call the plug gotta cop three
Looked up to Pablo Escobar, Money Meech, and Chapo
That's my top three
Bitch I was serving the sidewalk
Then I copped the drop hopped in the streets
You can’t name a young nigga that’s hot as me
All my niggas do murders and robberies
Got about 20 racks in the Robin Jeans
Niggas thinking I won off the lottery
When I hop in the push start with the pound
Niggas know that it ain't no stopping me
Outta town champ like Mayweather
Got a new crib off the boxing ring
Put the new Forgiatos on the Jeep
Run up 30 in a week

Irritatin' that bitch, you so aggravatin'
Fuck you thought, that I lost?

I told my big bro we ain't takin' losses
I got some secret money in the coffin
Smokin' the Candy Shop, it got me coughin'
Bitch, it's so hot like I turned on defroster
I'm fresh off the nitrous, ain't mess up a bit-it
How you say that I'm soft when I'm always revealin' you?
Got sixteen hoes, yeah, guess who's the villain now?
He call sixteen hoes, shit, I guess he a dunzo
Now she be on two drums, on your bongo

Stand on my money, I'm tall as Mutombo
Come to my block, yeah, it look like a gunshow
Trap out apartments, it's only a front door
Puttin' on for my block 'fore I could leave, fronto
Put my arms in my hoodie, this shit look like a poncho
If I stand on the money, then I'm tall like Hunxho
Look, I ain't tryna tussle, end of discussion
My shooter with me got bodies like he Russian
Fast money, slow money, I don't care, I ain't rushin'
My block hot, this shit like an oven
This shit like an oven, this shit, it be bustin'
