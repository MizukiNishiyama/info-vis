I wanna take you overseas, and stop by in Paris

And watch you taste the cheese

Take you to Beauvais, and get you smelling sweet

And love what you je suis, I love you, mon cheri

And if you feel the need, to dip and take a breather

Just know that I will wait, or that I'd never leave

I'm givin' you space, givin' you cover, uh-huh

Givin' you true love and abundance, uh-huh

Givin' and takin' because we're not a fling

Givin' me faith that it's not another



All the things I knew, all the plans I blew

All the men I shoot

Mm, boy, I can't wait to get next to you

I don't want to close my eyes

Nobody wants to fall (Fall)

After they did it all (All)

I wonder if I left my body there, would I

Die right in my sleep (Sleep)

But in reality (Tea)

It could feel like anything is possible

When I hear you speak, it really drives it deep

Woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night

It’s getting under my skin, baby

Take me home in the bugatti, ay

Hope you like a little tears, put it on his tea

That way you have a matcha, ay

Jump in bed without my bonnet (My bonnet)

Take a minute for the finer things (Ya)

I don’t even want to sleep

You doin’ some weed, blow it in my china bang

I be having hella dreams

Picking up the sheets feeling like a tidal wave

Hit me if you want it right away

If he hit me with the warning signs

Show up, hit him with apologies

Kicks on him with a pile of J’s

Bricks on him with a dick on him

Put a fit on him with the Prada shades

Pics on him and I ride away

How much do you want it? Twice a day

Four times on a holiday

Can you come through and your dreams come true

And trust me you won’t ever fall asleep



I know what you mean

You don’t fuck with randoms (And I hope you)

We just love to dream

In my fantasy when you woke up, oh

It’s not you, baby, it’s just me

I don’t believe what I just lost



I don't want to close my eyes

Nobody wants to fall (Fall)

After they did it all (All)

I wonder if I left my body there, would I

Die right in my sleep (Sleep)

But in reality (Tea)

It could feel like anything is possible

When I hear you speak, it really drives it deep

Woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night

It’s getting under my skin, baby

I look a little like Nashe, ay

You look a little exhausted, ay (Ya)

We should say no to the party, ay (Huh)

Take me home in the bugatti, ay

Hope you like a little tears, put it on his tea

That way you have a matcha, ay

Jump in bed without my bonnet (My bonnet)

Take a minute for the finer things (Ya)

I don’t even want to sleep

You doin’ some weed, blow it in my china bang

I be having hella dreams

Picking up the sheets feeling like a tidal wave

Hit me if you want it right away

If he hit me with the warning signs

Show up, hit him with apologies

Kicks on him with a pile of J’s

Bricks on him with a dick on him

Put a fit on him with the Prada shades

Pics on him and I ride away

How much do you want it? Twice a day

Four times on a holiday

Can you come through and your dreams come true

And trust me you won’t ever fall asleep



I know what you mean

You don’t fuck with randoms (And I hope you)

I got everything, everything but real love (And I hope you)
