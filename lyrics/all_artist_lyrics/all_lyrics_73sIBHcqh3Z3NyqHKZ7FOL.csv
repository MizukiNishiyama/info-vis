It's a new verse with my old flow

It's a new world and an old one

I was 17 back in '01

Now I’m forty-teen, havin' no fun

Man, I shake some on a livestream

In the summertime, buy this ice cream

But it melt fast, close your eyes and enjoy it and it might last

Have a role in a movie but it's tight cast

He don't drink Chance talkin' with a shot glass

It be like that

Hey, I'm a soldier

When I die, say I did it for the culture

But I live below your means, that's a pro tip

'Cause the streets pay a n* like a slow trip

I'm with my son, watching Bluey like we both Crip

They be scared to try, saying that they underground

Made him hunker down, saying he a prepper now

Had a crazy arm, picked him in the second round

Tore his AC hiking on the second down

Made a comeback but ain't nobody checkin' now

He ain't stick around, yeah



Summer's always comin' (Summer's always comin')

All I wanna do is get high, get high

But the weather's always changing

I'm just tryna save

My life (My life)

My life (My life)

My life (My life)

My life (My life)



When a girl can't get thicker (Like that)

And the house can't get bigger (Like that)

When you high, but you drink liquor

Feel like life go a lot quicker

How he lame but he that—

Be in the minor leagues, but I'm pro-black

I bet he hate his mom, how you know that?

You got a podcast 'cuz you can't rap (Like that)

He on some fresh 'n' fit shit, talking body counts

I count a body everytime I'm on tracks

Like that, ayy



Summer's always comin'

All I wanna do is get high, get high, get high (All I wanna do it get high)

I'm just tryna save my life

Everyone

Always says

That it's never gonna end

Every summer

Hopes and prays

Five star dreaming, then we would be living
Like we should be
I am not a pilot
Look at how we're flying
'Round the things that we decided

Like my peace and quiet

But the kids do not agree

And you'd swear with your degree

That'd you'd be smarter than me

Junior year I got straight Cs

Still got held back

I grew my hair back

No hang time

No hairline

No more swimming by myself



Steps beach, all I wanna do is

Saturday stepping with you

Steps beach, all I wanna do is

Saturday stepping with you



You were never one to pacify me

Rather feel ashamed than be unhappy

When it's all said it done I want you and the moonlight

Didn't you learn to walk this beach alone?

Mitchell put books on hold, but now you hold my hand

It takes some time to get there, hope you understand

That it won't be long



I was stopping shopping, had to get a run in

Rode my bike instead of driving

Easy to forgive when there's milk and pastries

Even when we argue, I'm in love with you

Even when you saucy at the barbecue

Better than better now

How 'bout another round?



Only another mile

85 but it feel like 200

Stare me down, like you gon' do something

We go home and we don't do nothing

Baby's screaming out, is it 1 AM? Let him crawl in bed

Waking up do it all again



Steps beach, all I wanna do is

Saturday stepping with you

Steps beach, all I wanna do is

Saturday stepping with you



I don't care which way we're heading home now

As long as it's two forward and one back

When it's all said and done I want you every lifetime

Every day we make moments in the sand

Every day we know all this will be washed away

When do we start forever if it's not today?

So it won't be long"

Talking dirty, you don't wash her mouth with olive soap

Now my hater want a job, but he ain't make the cut

Got my shorts above my knees, I'm feeling like a slut

Got my slammys right behind me if you wanna jug

Talking shit but when I see 'em they like ""Where my hug?""

I be stomping, pointing at me, she like ""There my thug""

Had to hold her back, she wilding, saying



Lemme talk my shit, ooh I'm on fire

If they said we friends they a liar

Pop shit, hoe, talk shit, huh huh, hold up, right



I love all my opps

The bitch done seen me whipping chicken

Almost called the cops

I might just throw her out the drop

I kicked the hoochie out the hummer

Almost killed the thot. Huh huh



On 5th ave with the cannon

I got 50 baby mammas in Atlanta

All the hoes screaming this a fucking anthem



Passing hoes no hands I'm cruising

Pop shit all day they snoozing

If you broke hoe you got the cooties

All my friends all dead like Uzi



Two chains on me I'm different

I can fuck up a check and go missing

When I walk in, I feel attention

Shitting on bitches I'm leaving 'em pissed



Bad hoes go loco

Body too tea, bitch hot like a throat coat

I ain't fucking with nobody, this a coupe

Why would I need me a photo?

Chocolate bitch, I be on toxic shit

He eat me up like coco

Let 'em catch up

Harvest the love you grow me each year

Without your love I wouldn't be here

Tears in my eyes

Boys who was telling me lies

Daddy took me to the side

Told me it's okay to cry

I felt so helpless inside



Can you feel me?



One more time



Love is a gift to the ones who didn't make it

I lost my dad and couldn't take it

I saw his face, I couldn't shake it

Baring my soul, completely naked

When you're with me you're whoever you are

They wanna speak, but don't know who you are

Back when they used to say, Danny

I had the heat like Miami

I ain't show up to the Grammys

I'd rather be with my family

He call for me, not the nanny



You just a stranger

Can't give nobody candy

You fell off you, you need a band-aid

I have more fun on my play dates

I got the drive, without the Mercedes

I never try, I know I'm enough

We slept in it. Not the whole night, but just enough time.

Magic happened, nothing was born luckily. It's up to me, but then we left.

The times have changed. The pleasures that I feel.

They say you never say never, it's real.

Shots from a redbone

Talking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones

Baby I'm just living right, and you can say I'm dead wrong

But can you disagree with that , versace on me yeah

Gold on the V-neck I'm passing every G check

Didn't fuck her for a month and never had a regret

It was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West

And we was just chill, I didn't really need sex

But really is we fucking yo

Never serious so I make everything a fucking joke

She be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke

Then we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke

See she just graduated got a new job

Took that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new Saab

Got that boyfriend that she living with and don't smoke no more

But yo it's cool I liked her when I knew her back before like



It's those summer days

Never fade away

It just stays the same

In my mind, no no

It's those summer days

Never fade away

Never fear the change

And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was, had stars on it as well
It looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess

I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them

so we could see what the waves look like

I'll be waiting here on the sand

I remember that first night you were wearing

a power ranger black T-shirt

So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother

Not as pure, so insecure

The times have changed

But really we just looked up at the stars

For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars

The world was ours it was, yours

It was mine

The time flew by like it was prime time

and I'm inside of

Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be

with me on this beautiful night

Maybe we can make things right

Maybe we can do it without any spite

It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end

So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends



Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him

If we met bet it would be awkward break out the sudafed

Cause the flow cold, like it's so cold

I was smoking smoking John Lennon where my Yoko?

This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet

Verbal maniac, imma show you the illest get my cousin to kill it

Had a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out

Got the top down in the back we could fall out

We could fall out, nigga we could fall out

Your girlfriend push a prius she giving me that genius

Mensa, we that Tony Danza

Wine on the rug man you know that shit expensive

I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka

Vape so good and the pot like lobster

Nigga imma monster, fuck it I'm a monstar

Man, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car

That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard

Turn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are

We are becoming god

We are becoming god

We are becoming god

We are becoming god

We are becoming god

We are becoming god

We are becoming god

We are becoming god

We are becoming god

We are becoming god



I guess this ending's the best for me

But I can't leave you behind

You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind



Goddamn, Goddamn Goddamn

Yo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit

But, does that even matter?

You know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man, juxta fucking position

My nigga Jaden Smith dropping jewels and niggas

don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith but

It's all about packaging right?

Real shit though, good and bad is all relative man

It really is, a lot of niggas is sheep

We don't even know what we like anymore

we just know what the most hype is shit

Do you really like that shit you like?

Or you like the way they gave it to you?

You know what I'm saying? Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing

Dave Chapelle said that, the one that taste 

he best was the one that was paying him the most at the time

That's all that happens with us man, we some weak niggas man all of us

Followers, sheeps, plural made that shit up

Apology ain't no real word my nigga

We know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules

that don't even fucking exist man

Funny thing is man is like, as a futurist, and I can call myself a futurist

Nobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone

So does it even matter?

Yes it does"

Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura, acting blacker

Than a Bernie Mac

We were so Jay Z and Beyonce, my aunt say ""keep the sex game picante""

The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on

To make me try and forget that there was something wrong

Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on

We popped pills at the Coachella

Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try

So let's try



Whoa

But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me

And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?

Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino

Saw I was rich, now they fucking with 'Bino

Brown leather bag, the vacation Messina

The boat in the harbor, I rule the marina

10K for the drinks, now they say I'm insane

It's been that for a minute, now Hedi Slimane

I been black, lucrative, since Danity Kane

Who came back for a minute, now everything changed

High as a kite, lime in the light

Y'all niggas might whine every night

I ain't invite all these people to my mothafuckin' house

Get the fuck out of my house!"

Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?
Can't sleep...

3 a.m., stare at the ceiling, murder the feeling

Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse

So appropriate, cornucopia, so be it, say I'm over it

Playing Lil Durk, ""Dis Ain't What U Want""

Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk

Pass a Fatburger through Atwater village

Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me

Park by the bridge, sit on the hood

Look at the cars, stare at my hands, look at the moon

I can't find it, it's gone, what's wrong?

Didn't respond when I texted you last night, you alright, yeah?



Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away

I'm a murderer, what can I say?

Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away

I'm a murderer, what does that change?



Man, there's a star bound to a body inside of me

20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees

Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry

And half of an apple pie, when I'm laughing, I'm satisfied

When I'm dying, I'm still alive, strange position

I'm in a good mood, so good I'mma kill that spider

The kinda things that they told me, alone don't mean

That you lonely, alone means you finally get it admit it

Go home, lock up the door, fold up the clothes

Watch cartoons for an hour, turn off the lights

Look at the recluse, look at the recluse

Look at the recluse, look at the rec...



Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away

I'm a murderer, what can I say?

Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away

I'm a murderer, what does that change?"

There were so many pretty people, so many pretty faces. 
I talked to some birds, I fell in love again, and none of this ever ended. 
Everything just kept going, and going, and going. 
And even when you laughed, you cried. 
And even when you were sad, you were really happy. 

Cause you were here. And I got to meet every star, every planet, everything that made me. 

And we all kissed, and became the same. 

We became the same. We became the same""



Who would have thought this, we almost lost it

When you lie inside darkness, it's hard to see

And we sleep in tradition, keep 'em off in the distance

To tell you that I haven't been



We are all cold water

Why try at all? Why bother?



Just hold me close, my darling

Just hold me close, my darling

Just hold me close, my darling

Just hold me close, my darling



Who would have dreamed this? You couldn't mean this

It would be some type of meanness to where you are

Cause I don't know where to go and no one else seems to know



We are all knights fallen

Why try at all? Dark calling

So we're left alone, no one left to call upon

Be still now, broken bones, as I travel on



Just hold me close, my darling

Just hold me close, my darling

Just hold me close, my darling

Just hold me close, my darling"

It's crazy how the world look different

It's crazy how the girls look different, the colors and the sounds so vivid

You never catch your boy po-pimpin'

Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least for sure

And they say there's no way

I should stay with someone like you, but I tell them no

There's no way I could stray

Gotta stay with someone like you

That I am ready to go, heartbeat
A heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak

I can't speak



[Verse 1]

I know what your boy like

Skinny tie and a cuff tight

He go and make breakfast

You walk around naked

I might just text you

Turn your phone over, when it's all over

No settling down, my text go to your screen

You know better than that

I come around when you least expect me

I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty

You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me

I need to be alone like the way you left me

You start calling, you start crying

I come over, I'm inside you

I can't find you

The girl that I once had

But the sex that we have, isn't half bad

The text say that ""It's not fair""

That's code for ""He's not here""

And I'mma flirt with this new girl

And I'mma call if it don't work

So we fuck, till we come, to conclusions

All the things that we thought we was losing

I'm ghost and you know this

That's why we broke up in the first place

It's late night Thursday

I know that you heard me

But you don't want the same thing

Well two can play that game

So I'm chilling with my girlfriend

But she not my real girlfriend

She got a key to my place but

She's not my real girlfriend

Stupid, so dummy

Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'

I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me

And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred

And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate

She on time, but she late for they first date

Cause he went and tried out all new condoms

Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?

Right? Wrong

Askin' him if she gonna play games

With the super smash brothers, but none of them you

I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through

Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two

I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?

Uh, you were crazy

I got a heart, but the artichoke

Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light

[Verse 3]

So we're done? This the real shit?

We used to hold hands like field trips

I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick

I read his post on your wall and I feel sick

He ain't cool, he ball and all that

But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps

You coulda wait to date

I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate

I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate

You know that I'm the best when I'm a-ffection-ate

I'm the best that you had, face it

J and Keyshia are related, racist

I give you money, then you burn it, like you made off

She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off

I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""

That we dated like raps about Bin Laden

Ayo, fuck this

Are we dating? Are we fucking?

Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?

I give you money, then you burn it, like you made off

She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off

I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""

That we dated like raps about Bin Laden

Told me I should just quit: ""first of all, you talk white!

Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet""

Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect

I put in work, ask Ludwig

Put my soul on the track like shoes did

Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness

Shoutout to Gambino, girls, my dick is in the building

I know you hate me cause your little cousin play me

I like black girls who nerdy, but when they dance they be sayin' ""Owww""

Sorry for who followed me

Chillin' with a Filipino, at your local Jollibee

Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy

So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me

I don't talk soft, that's that other guy

I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
Hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want
Used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights

Putting on a stone face

He's saving up so we can get our own place

In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me

They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me

Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced

But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants

And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out

They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about

Cause hood shit and black shit is super different

So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition

Mom and dad wouldn't listen

They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that

All their friends in NY deal crack

It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em

But when you leave the hood they think that you look down on 'em

The truth is we still struggle on a different plane

7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same

Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit

But all they get now is, ""Can your son read this script?""

Yeah

Dad lost his job

Mama worked at Mrs. Winner's

Gun pulled in her face

She still made dinner

?Donald watch the meter

So they don't turn the lights off""

Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school

And I hate it there

They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair

And my uncle on that stuff that got my Grandma shook

Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book

He's supposed to pay 'em back

He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero

So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow

Like that would do somethin'

But she's got six kids, she's gotta do somethin'

She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin

And he mad cause his father ain't around

He lookin' at me now, like

""Why you so fuckin lucky?

I had a father too

But he ain't around so I'mma take it out on you""

We used to say ""I love you""

Now we only think that shit

It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with

Street took you over

I want my cousin back

The world sayin' what you are because you're young and black

Don't believe 'em

You're still that kid that kept the older boys from teasin'

For some reason

Skateboardin' down at Washington Square

Lookin' for quarters

Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, ugh

I'm so broke man

Scholarship apology

Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'

Girls like, ""we love you, we go to LSU

You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you""

This rap stuff is magic

I used to get called ""Oreo"" and ""Faggot""

I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at

Oh you got a mixtape? That's fantastic

But everybody thought it was jokes though

They half right, the joke is

I got flow so don't act like

You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be

I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he can't be

I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante

Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy

[Verse 2]

It's hard to make HOV the footsteps you followin'

Especially when your niggas look like Carlton

The pretty girls usin' skin so soft

Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off

Man you act too soft

Fuck you! I'm from the projects

My mom was just workin' to give me options

No live shows, cause I can't find sponsors

For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert

Yeah so, whatcha gonna do man?

You won't speak to the hood, man

If I was given one chance I think I could, man

These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it

Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed

All I do is make the stuff I wanna write

Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite

Now I'm firefly like a burning kite

And yousa fake fuck like a fleshlight

Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy

Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?

Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough

Now text me pics sayin', ""You could tear this up""

I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry

But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me

Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be

Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully

Listening to ""Sky is the Limit"" on my Walkman

Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can

Dope-boy swag

I always wanted that

But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ash

But no love for the son of a commuter

Who was a radio head and okay at them computers

At the post office

It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins

All my people need throat lozenge

My fear is dead

Ambition drove the hearse

But niggas got my feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church

Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough

We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?

The black experience is blackened serious

Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us

White kids get to wear whatever hat they want

When it comes to black kids one size fits all

[Break]

We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga

You hear me?

We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga

We the baddest nigga, we the baddest



[Verse 2]

The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's

The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls

They only see you how they wanna see you

'Til you make them see you in some other way

I'm trippin' off the other day

Cause God knows what these white kids sayin'

Dude you're not not racist cause The Wire's in your Netflix cue

Subtle racism

It's hard to pin it cause you'd only understand

If you were me for just a minute

This one kid said somethin' that was really bad

He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad

I think that's kinda sad

Mostly cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that

If you're a father, you should stick around if you could

Cause even if you're bad at it, you get Tiger Woods

MJ

We warriors, we all need senseis

Change everything that we've done so far

I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R

I mean just the way that we see each other

I won't stop until they say, ""James Franco is the white Donald Glover""

Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness

Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice

Aimin' for the throne, Jay and Ye said to watch that

They ask me what I'm doin', I say I'm stealin' rock back

I'm a black star in a black car with a black card

They wanna knock me out

They try a nigga

Realest motherfucker in the game, like Tron nigga

Forget these white girls

I need some variation

Especially if she very Asian

She got an ugly friend? Roll solo

Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset?

Can we try something new and not be suspect?

I don't really know, we fucked up bad

You don't wanna see my dudes when they get mad

I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me

That'll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee

And laugh while they masturbate all over your beaten body

Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode

Somethin' for these black kids to call they own

She stay down like that new coat that I bought her

And the fly rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water

And I'm lookin' at her butt

Thats that 20/20 hindsight

My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson: 5 Mikes

Donald Glover, no relation

Always workin', no vacation

They couldn't feel me, novacation

Murder versus the only motive was motivation

Money equals freedom

Though I'm fly I'm ill I'm running shit

3-points, field goal

Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell

Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian Bale

Yeah, they starin' at me jealous cause I do shows bigger

But your looks don't help, like an old gold digger

Uncool, but lyrically I'm a stone cold killer

So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas

Yeah, now that's the line of the century

Niggas missed it, too busy

They lyin' 'bout penitentiary

Man, you ain't been there

Nigga you been scared

And I'm still living single like Synclaire

Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate

When I wasn't white enough to use your pool when I was 8

Stone Mountain you raised me well

I'm stared at by Confederates but hard as hell

Tight jeans penny loafers, but I still drink a Bodine

Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides

I'm just a kid who blowing up with my father's name

And every black ""you're not black enough""

Is a white ""you're all the same""

DOOM Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes

Cuz its oreos, twinkies, coconuts, delicious

I said I want a full house

They said, ""You got it dude!""

People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long

Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'

And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins

How'd it happen? Honesty did it

See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit

Yeah I bodied the limits and I get at them fakers

I am what I am: everything I wanna be

[Outro]

This is on a bus back from camp. I'm thirteen and so are you. Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble. It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That's you. And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us. We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles. I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you, but I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me. You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer, content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on. A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh, is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh, but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be. A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her, whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet



Back in the real world we don't go to the same school, and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood, we won't go to the same high school. So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something. And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something. The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep. We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know. And then I'm like, ?Can I tell you something?? And all of a sudden I'm telling you. And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway. And there's no expression on it. And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said ?yes? or ?no? yet. And regrettably I end up using the word ?destiny.? I don't remember in what context. Doesn't matter. Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, ?okay.? I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to spoil the moment, but there's nowhere to go because we're are on a bus. So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am



I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore. The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on. I turn and you're not there. Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore. We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church. The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now, your bags and things piled high in the trunk. The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus, just as one of them reaches my row. It used to be our row, on our way off. It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head. Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise. She stops and looks down at me. And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face, but I can see her smile. And she says one word: ?destiny.? Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus. I didn't know you were friends with them



I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over. So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts. This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad, this is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not, I'm just saying it's what I learned. I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them. But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you. Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose. I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus. I still haven't"

Hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want
Used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights

Putting on a stone face

He's saving up so we can get our own place

In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me

They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me

Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced

But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants

And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out

They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about

Cause hood shit and black shit is super different

So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition

Mom and dad wouldn't listen

They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that

All their friends in NY deal crack

It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em

But when you leave the hood they think that you look down on 'em

The truth is we still struggle on a different plane

7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same

Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit

But all they get now is, ""Can your son read this script?""

Yeah

Dad lost his job

Mama worked at Mrs. Winner's

Gun pulled in her face

She still made dinner

?Donald watch the meter

So they don't turn the lights off""

Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school

And I hate it there

They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair

And my uncle on that stuff that got my Grandma shook

Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book

He's supposed to pay 'em back

He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero

So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow

Like that would do somethin'

But she's got six kids, she's gotta do somethin'

She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin

And he mad cause his father ain't around

He lookin' at me now, like

""Why you so fuckin lucky?

I had a father too

But he ain't around so I'mma take it out on you""

We used to say ""I love you""

Now we only think that shit

It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with

Street took you over

I want my cousin back

The world sayin' what you are because you're young and black

Don't believe 'em

You're still that kid that kept the older boys from teasin'

I used to get called ""Oreo"" and ""Faggot""

I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at

Oh you got a mixtape? That's fantastic

But everybody thought it was jokes though

They half right, the joke is

I got flow so don't act like

You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be

You won't speak to the hood, man

If I was given one chance I think I could, man

Now I'm firefly like a burning kite

And yousa fake fuck like a fleshlight

Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy

Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?

Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough

Now text me pics sayin', ""You could tear this up""

I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
A heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak

I can't speak



[Verse 1]

I know what your boy like

Skinny tie and a cuff tight

He go and make breakfast

You walk around naked

I might just text you

Turn your phone over, when it's all over

No settling down, my text go to your screen

You know better than that

I come around when you least expect me

I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty

You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me

I need to be alone like the way you left me

You start calling, you start crying

I come over, I'm inside you

I can't find you

The girl that I once had

But the sex that we have, isn't half bad

The text say that ""It's not fair""

That's code for ""He's not here""

And I'mma flirt with this new girl

And I'mma call if it don't work

So we fuck, till we come, to conclusions

All the things that we thought we was losing

I'm ghost and you know this

That's why we broke up in the first place

Cause



[Hook x2]



[Verse 2]

It's late night Thursday

I know that you heard me

But you don't want the same thing

Well two can play that game

So I'm chilling with my girlfriend

But she not my real girlfriend

She got a key to my place but

She's not my real girlfriend

Stupid, so dummy

Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'

I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me

And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred

And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate

She on time, but she late for they first date

Cause he went and tried out all new condoms

Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?

Right? Wrong

Askin' him if she gonna play games

With the super smash brothers, but none of them you

I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through

Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two

I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?

Uh, you were crazy

I got a heart, but the artichoke

Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light



[Hook x2]



[Verse 3]

So we're done? This the real shit?

We used to hold hands like field trips

I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick

I read his post on your wall and I feel sick

He ain't cool, he ball and all that

But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps

You coulda wait to date

I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate

I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate

You know that I'm the best when I'm a-ffection-ate

I'm the best that you had, face it

J and Keyshia are related, racist

I give you money, then you burn it, like you made off

She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off

I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""

That we dated like raps about Bin Laden

Ayo, fuck this

Are we dating? Are we fucking?

Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?

I wish we never fucked, and I mean that



But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it's fuckin' awesome"

Who ain't been heard

The only white rapper who's allowed to say the n-word

I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card

Now I got some street cred

Use it 'til it's maxed out

I got a girl on my arm dude, show respect

Something crazy, an Asian, Virginia Tech

She too fine

I do dimes

If not that, I'm walking out with 2 fives

Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet

Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect

Ballin' since '83

Half of 'em say gay

Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-baby's-say

I'm a problem

I'm lame as fuck homie

But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me

Fuck the cool kids

Not Chuck Inglish, but people who think

That hatin on me makes them distinguished

Like, ""What is this nigga doin rap is for real blacks

I hate that fucking faggot man he think that we feel that""

Or

""I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown

So I'm allowed

To say what all his raps are about""

You better shut your mouth

Before I fuck it

You really hate my lyrics?

Or Kid Cudi's? Nigga

Nigga got signed, its an anomily

No cosine, trigonometry

""Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!""

I'm real black I survive when the pressure on

Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her

Clash of the titans

Baby, your tits is titular

Listenin to some KISS FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj

Super Bass, super face inside a garage

It's not a massage

Spa rap with a happy ending

Old niggas wanna assassinate me

It's a shame

These kids was supposed to save rap

Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap

He dont give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?

Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach

Comin' on that paint back

[Verse 1]

Anyway

A New York nine's an everywhere-else six

Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks

I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend

He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on West End

He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids

Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig

Most hoes poke holes in Trojans

Most people don't fuckin' hit the lotto but my folks did

I'm a mess

That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true

Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you

When I'm depressed you're someone I run to

But, I guess meet me at Pianos

And cross-fadin' off of Nanos

Ugh, on that hipster shit

And you's a hipster, bitch

Yo, but not in the lame way

Like, you ain't livin' out in BK

Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay

Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ

Like, she listenin' to old Freeway

Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different

Right, that's why your friends need wristbands?

Fuck you

And can I have this dance?

[Verse 2]

We could pretend if you want to, like

We in love and started datin' after art school

Cause either way we both lyin' more than half of the time

Except for when I'm home workin' on your graphic design

Everytime we see each other I'm takin' you home

Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stalone

Yellow 9/11 Persian girl in the back car

But me writin' a verse the only way they buyin' a bar

White boys used to trip and send me over a gin

But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend

She got ironic tattoos on her back

That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats

Watchin' lames handle they fame

They bang any broad with bangs

In a band with an animal name

Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson

Anallin' anyone is the plan for the evening

I'm kidding, stop

Girl cryin' on Ludlow

She still look good though

Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?

Movie ass, not a 10 but a Super 8

You ain't see me at the show, I was super great

Hotel penthouse, go on and let it roominate

Did everything I could, then I kept goin'

[Verse 1]

You such a fuckin' lame

It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade

My momma said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down

Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found

Not bad for a family of foster child

Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now

But them niggas saw through me

Are you serious? What is this?

Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis

Listening to ""Sky is the Limit"" on my Walkman

Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can

Dope-boy swag

I always wanted that

But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ash

But no love for the son of a commuter

Who was a radio head and okay at them computers

At the post office

It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins

All my people need throat lozenge

My fear is dead

Ambition drove the hearse

But niggas got my feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church

Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough

We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?

The black experience is blackened serious

Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us

White kids get to wear whatever hat they want

When it comes to black kids one size fits all

The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's

The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls

They only see you how they wanna see you

'Til you make them see you in some other way

I'm trippin' off the other day

Cause God knows what these white kids sayin'

Dude you're not not racist cause The Wire's in your Netflix cue

Subtle racism

It's hard to pin it cause you'd only understand

If you were me for just a minute

This one kid said somethin' that was really bad

He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad

I think that's kinda sad

Mostly cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that

If you're a father, you should stick around if you could

Cause even if you're bad at it, you get Tiger Woods

MJ

We warriors, we all need senseis

Change everything that we've done so far

I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R

I mean just the way that we see each other

I won't stop until they say, ""James Franco is the white Donald Glover""

Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness

Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice

Aimin' for the throne, Jay and Ye said to watch that

They ask me what I'm doin', I say I'm stealin' rock back

Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset?

Can we try something new and not be suspect?

I don't really know, we fucked up bad

You don't wanna see my dudes when they get mad

I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me

That'll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee

On stage with my family in front of me

I am what I am: everything I wanna be

[Outro]

This is on a bus back from camp. I'm thirteen and so are you. Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble. It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That's you. And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us. We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles. I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you, but I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me. You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer, content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on. A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh, is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh, but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be. A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her, whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet



Back in the real world we don't go to the same school, and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood, we won't go to the same high school. So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something. And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something. The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep. We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know. And then I'm like, ?Can I tell you something?? And all of a sudden I'm telling you. And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway. And there's no expression on it. And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said ?yes? or ?no? yet. And regrettably I end up using the word ?destiny.? I don't remember in what context. Doesn't matter. Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, ?okay.? I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to spoil the moment, but there's nowhere to go because we're are on a bus. So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am



I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore. The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on. I turn and you're not there. Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore. We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church. The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now, your bags and things piled high in the trunk. The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus, just as one of them reaches my row. It used to be our row, on our way off. It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head. Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise. She stops and looks down at me. And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face, but I can see her smile. And she says one word: ?destiny.? Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus. I didn't know you were friends with them



I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over. So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts. This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad, this is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not, I'm just saying it's what I learned. I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them. But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you. Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose. I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus. I still haven't"

Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough

You get sloppy drunk, I stay whiskey neat

My clique should be cancelled, Freaks and Geeks"

But I'm not goin' back
Not goin' back, baby
Please tell me you don't want me to fail
'Cause I'm not goin' back

Not goin' back



I coulda been a tragedy

That's why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me

'Cause they ain't have the smarts or the heart

Ain't you read the fuckin' book? Things fall apart

I was never gonna stay the same

All I ever really wanted was to change the game

Spent the year kickin' ass and takin' names

Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne

Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in

Callin' the new Will Smith, that's Jaden

Callin' me a faggot when I'm rappin', that's hatin'

I need to slow down, what the fuck is y'all sayin'?

Step inside the party, y'all niggas is mood killers

My lifestyle simple, live easy and Bruce Willis

I'm the boss, Michael Scott, y'all bitches is just Phyllis

Set the world on fire, y'all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?

That's why these fuckin' MCs want their asses back

Don't you know that I'm a rapist? Ask a track

Whiskey-sippin', wanna drink the whole bottle

But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model

Fuckin' hate me, that's what I'm used to

Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil

God damn, man, there's gotta be a better way

Than pill-poppin' all these drugs so I can stay awake

Like I'm Jessie in this bitch, I'm so excited

There's a party at the top, you ain't invited

But it's lame, and all the bitches is fake

You think about your old girl and how breakin' up's a mistake

Black dudes assume I'm closeted or kinda gay

White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey

I Am Donald is a full-time job

These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off



It seems like they all want me to fail

But I'm not goin' back

Not goin' back, baby



Please tell me you don't want me to fail

'Cause I'm not goin' back

Not goin' ba-ack



Dirty girls love my dick, they're cockroaches

Jewish girls eat my meat, it's not kosher

Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee

Got nothin' against the sistas, I just don't think they're into me

I am not a thug, AKA what they pretend to be

I am just myself, AKA my worst enemy

Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fuckin' knife

I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight

It's cool, though, it's all good

You want a dude who keep it real, and stay hood

I'm sorry, babe, but I act me

I don't act black, whatever that be

I'm just happy these girls seem into me now

Yeah, they lookin' for some In N Out, animal style

With this lettuce, cheese, bread, makin' sandwiches

That's why you niggas fail like all of your parents' marriages

Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song

When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show

She said to write her somethin' nice on the next track

But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap

Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb

Believe me, it was bad, we're better off, you're welcome

I worked hard on that song like day and night

That whole song, made this one verse crazy, right?

I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that

Like that bullshit you talked before Culdesac

'I didn't know he had it in 'I'm! '

Couldn't see me as Spiderman, but now I'm spittin' venom

Now you payin' attention, pick your fuckin' face up

When I wanna be a superhero I just wake up

Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz

I refuse to go back to not likin' who I was

Because



Fake love, these fake dreams

These fake sounds

All the things that we felt

Your voice was screaming too loud

I know what you're ready to be

But it isn't with me

So I'm ready to leave you alone



I don't really wanna fight like this

I don't ever wanna lose your kiss

All I ever wanted was someone to hold on to



I just wanna be your girl

Everything you haven't heard, plus

I just wanna be with you



(With you) With you

(With you) With you

(With you) I just wanna be with you



(With you) With you

(With you) With you

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh"

I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
A heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak

I can't speak



[Verse 1]

I know what your boy like

Skinny tie and a cuff tight

He go and make breakfast

You walk around naked

I might just text you

Turn your phone over, when it's all over

No settling down, my text go to your screen

You know better than that

I come around when you least expect me

I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty

You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me

I need to be alone like the way you left me

You start calling, you start crying

I come over, I'm inside you

I can't find you

The girl that I once had

But the sex that we have, isn't half bad

The text say that ""It's not fair""

That's code for ""He's not here""

And I'mma flirt with this new girl

And I'mma call if it don't work

So we fuck, till we come, to conclusions

All the things that we thought we was losing

I'm ghost and you know this

That's why we broke up in the first place

Cause



[Hook x2]



[Verse 2]

It's late night Thursday

I know that you heard me

But you don't want the same thing

Well two can play that game

So I'm chilling with my girlfriend

But she not my real girlfriend

She got a key to my place but

She's not my real girlfriend

Stupid, so dummy

Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'

I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me

And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred

And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate

She on time, but she late for they first date

Cause he went and tried out all new condoms

Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?

Right? Wrong

Askin' him if she gonna play games

With the super smash brothers, but none of them you

I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through

Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two

I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?

Uh, you were crazy

I got a heart, but the artichoke

Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light



[Hook x2]



[Verse 3]

So we're done? This the real shit?

We used to hold hands like field trips

I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick

I read his post on your wall and I feel sick

He ain't cool, he ball and all that

But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps

You coulda wait to date

I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate

I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate

You know that I'm the best when I'm a-ffection-ate

I'm the best that you had, face it

J and Keyshia are related, racist

I give you money, then you burn it, like you made off

She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off

I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""

That we dated like raps about Bin Laden

Ayo, fuck this

Are we dating? Are we fucking?

Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?

I wish we never fucked, and I mean that



But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it's fuckin' awesome"
