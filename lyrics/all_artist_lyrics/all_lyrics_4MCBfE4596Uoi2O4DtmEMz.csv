Thе Devil told me, ""Good show, break a lеg"" (Break a leg)

All these painkillers like I got a pair of broken legs (Broken legs)

All these Percs I pop, you'd thought I was plannin' to break my neck

Grindin' man, I'm hungry for this shit like I ain't ate yet

You wish that you could have what I could have, you could just say that

If you ain't my lil' bitch, then, bitch, them convos, you can save that

These niggas think they invincible 'til they see them bullet holes in they Maybach

You pop some ecstasy first, it gets progressively worse

Try your best to reverse unsuccessfully flirtin' with certain death and revertin' to your promethazine urge

The fuckin' devil he lurks, lose your best friend he smirks

Wake up and everything hurts and as you spiral downward listen

I know just how it is when

You start slow then before you notice it now you're mixin'

Oxy's without prescription

Cough medicine, valium with 'em but ain't that how addiction

Sort of works they call it lean 'cause you gravitate and lean towards the perp

The blessing or the curse of fame 'cause now you can afford the syrup

Percocet and Percoden but that ain't what you meant when you said that you're in it for the perks

Develop a habit out of that

Need a Xanax now to rap

So you pop it before you record a verse

Your buzz wear down

Like a rabbit out a hat

Makes you wanna pull your hair out

Fentanyl, Oxy

Demerol, them are all what possibly got Shock G, Roxy

Codone and lean is probably what got Lil Peep and ODB

So many who OD be way too young to go see me

I was lucky my escape was narrow and do

Not think I take it for granted that I'm still here synthetic heroin you

Tried to kill me then you murdered Jarad didn't you

Piece of shit thanks to you now we lost Gangsta Boo and Pimp C, Prince and Michael mixing Nyquil

With prescription Vic's addiction's like a fucking vicious cycle

Juice we will forever miss you

To the younger generation I ain't lecturing you but man just be careful when you

Think I need a change

All girls are the same

They're rotting my brain, love

Think I need a change

Before I go insane, love



Ten minutes, she tell me it would take ten minutes

To break my heart, oh no she didn't

Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow

Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow

And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind

I know I been trippin', I'm still wasting my time

All the time given, am I dyin? Am I livin'?

It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'



Now I am insane

Demons in my brain, love

Peace I can't obtain

Cause all these girls the same, love

Now I am insane

Demons in my brain, love

Peace I can't obtain

Cause all these girls the same, love"

It's to the point where I love and I hate you

I know that you want me dead

I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing

Thinking of you in my bed

You were my everything

Thoughts of a wedding ring

Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)

I didn't want it to end

I watch it blow in the wind

I should've listened to my friends

Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

I was tangled up in your drastic ways

Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes

I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak



You made my heart break

You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)

You made my heart break

You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)

You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)

You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)

You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)

Crying, I'm nauseous

I hear that so often

I sometimes get lost in my head

I'm so in love with that girl (Yeah)

I got the juice in this world (Woah)

She don't believe in loyalty, but want diamonds and pearls

Fuck that, I had to man up

Tried to boost my confidence and froze my hand up

I'm still hot, turn that fan on

This shit had me depressed, I almost died off Xan' punch (Yeah)

She said that she love me, but she sucked that boy up (Oh)

You got somethin' to say, go 'head now, boy just speak up (Woah)

Tryna break me down because they can't defeat us (No)

I'm a baker now, like that girl Anita

Should've listened to my boy, he said, ""Don't keep her""

Nowadays, I love you so much, I can't leave ya

Can't take back the love that I gave you

It's to the point where I love and I hate you

Maybe it's because my girlfriend is the plug

Cocaine strums like guitar chords

She loves drugs, she goes hardcore

She's hidin' from the truth, it's under the rug

Maybe it's because the lies, they fill the room

You see the ghost on her front porch

You see the blood at her front door

Lookin' at the things that we couldn't afford

Fantasies became reality, but only for one of us

You know, like everything was not only mellow, but didn't feel any pain
It just didn't–, it just kind of numbed things
I don't know at what point exactly it started to be a problem
I just remember likin' it more and more
People try to tell me that I had a problem

I would say ""Get that fuckin' person out of here, I can't believe they said that shit to me, they know nothin' about my fuckin' life, are they out of their fuckin' mind?""

I'm not out there shootin' heroin, I'm not out there fuckin', you know, puttin' coke up my nose, I'm not smokin' crack

You'rе struggling with the argument of ""Do you have a problеm, or do you not have a problem? Can you control it, or can you not?""

And I literally thought I could control it

You're taking things that people are giving you that, you don't even know what the fuck they are

They look like a pill, and they look– they're shaped like something that you take, so you take it, you know?

Xanax, Valium, tomato-tomato

You know what I mean? It's th-the same thing, it's all in the same family, fuck it, take it

Had I had gotten to the hospital about two hours later, I would've died

My organs were shutting down, my liver, kidneys, everything

They were gonna have to put me on dialysis, they didn't think I was gonna make it

My bottom was gonna be death, within a month, I had relapsed

And shot right back up to the same amount of pills that I was taking

I remember just walking around my house and thinking every single day, like ""I'm gonna fucking die"", like, I'm-I'm looking at my kids, and I need to be here for this

Coming off of everything, I literally was up twenty-four hours a day for three weeks straight

And I mean not sleeping, not even nodding off for a fucking minute

Like, I was literally just up, like, looking at the TV

I had to regain motor skills, I had to regain talking skills

It's been a-a learning process, like, it's been, I'm growing

I just couldn't believe that anybody could ever be naturally happy, or naturally function, or be just enjoying life in general, without being on something

So, I would say that t-to anybody that i-it does get better, you know? It just– it does"

They say living's harder than dying, I'm willing to gamble that

It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses

Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person

Take three more, I swear it's worth it

But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse

I remember losing little bro, he laying in the dirt

Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse

And to be so young

He like mastered that so fucking quickly

It's really sad man, that, that

You know who the best freestyler I've ever seen is?

Yeah?

Juice WRLD

Juice, yeah

Have you ever seen his freestyles?

Yeah

They're, they're so, they're never-ending

He can do it for like an hour

And he makes total sense the entire time

And is actually really, like good, like intricate flow patterns

He, like to me, he was the best freestyler I've ever seen

And he was like the best hitmak- he was like

I really feel like he was the most talented, eh, like songwriter in music

If, I can't imagine there just goin' in there and doin' one-

Juice did that, my friend, Benny worked with Juice

And he would say, he would go in the booth

Go three minutes over the beat, and it be a hit

And then he said, ""Okay, another one""

And then he'd go three minutes over the beat

And it be a different hit

And then he'd be like, ""Just pick whatever version you want""

He would tell Benny to cut it up?

No, not even cut it up, just like pick

What hit do you want?

He freestyled- the whole song is freestyled

Ugh

Hits

Ugh

Like smash hits

How, how, how?

I sit in my room for six months and write a verse

This guy goes in there and it's four minutes and it's a smash



I think, like, what

What Juice was to our generation, bro

And the impact he had on us is what Biggie did for New York, for real

Like, I really think, um, what, he had that Biggie, Pac effect

Wait until the drugs fade out

Hate making love when I'm faded

That's because I wanna feel it

Girl, you give me the best feelin'

Yes, girl you're the best, take away stress, love me to death

Even when I'm a mess

I am the better one

I won't let you forget me



Did this shit in the past but I want it to last

You were made outta plastic (fake)

I was tangled up in your drastic ways

Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?



Easier said than done

I thought you were the one

The devil trying to test me I'm failing, Inhaling

All that heartbreak, that was a year ago

Wanted you back, so bad, but that's



Long gone, long gone, long gone

Long gone, long gone, long gone

Long gone, long gone, long gone

Long gone



What you don't seem to understand is

You really took my love for granted

You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish



Haven't been in love in a long while

Wait until my next girl finds out

Then I'm scared we gone break up and fall out

Drownin' in my thoughts baby looking for a lighthouse

Ain't no sleep I been feeling like a night owl

Music turnt up, neighbours telling me to pipe down

Oh the other hand, I think I found my future wife

But she not here with me so it get lonely at night , aye



I hope, her love doesn't go away

I hope this ain't a phase

One more heartbreak and I'll be
