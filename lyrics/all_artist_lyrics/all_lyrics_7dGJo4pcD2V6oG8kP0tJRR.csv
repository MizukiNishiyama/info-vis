With balls in his durag, he sags, fearin' no man
He stands, pen in his hand like Edward Scissorhands
Will slice competition and just goes about his business
Anyone who knows about him knows about his shindig

Shenanigans, and all his whacky antics in the papers

Shank is danglin', the baby tangled in a blanket, stranglin'

I'm hangin' him over the railing by the ankles on some gangster shit

Child endangerment, dark brain arcane but it Mark Twainin' it

You aren't tamin' it, sharp pain in the heart

Aimin' a bar chain but it carve names in it

Start sprayin' and start ravin' 'em, you starve, ravin' it

You're at arm's length, you're in harm's way of it

'Bout to show your ass why I'm still a pain in it

You wanna know how I do it? I can't explain this shit

Mechanic's brain with a pinch of Big Daddy Kane in it

But I can show you the ropes 'til you get the hang of it

Elephant's eye, this of the tough element

Of intelligent hoodlum, arrested development

Cellar dwellers and wise intelligence, it's elementary

Through hell I went, accelerate from lack of melanin

Failin' in school, smart eloquent

Help me to rebel against shit, so well and bent

So eloquently, yet, I was irrelevant

Soon as I quit givin' a fuck and started to sell a bit

Now just travel inside the mind of a hater

'Cause I don't see no fans, all I see's a bunch of complainers

""Kendrick's album was cool but it didn't have any bangers""

""Wayne's album or Ye's, couldn't tell you which one was lamer""

""Joyner's album was corny, Shady's new shit is way worse""

""Everything is either too tame or there's too much anger""

""I didn't like the beef so I hated Might Delete Later""

You nerdy pricks would find somethin' wrong with 36 Chambers

So what they do for the greats? Pick the part of Picasso and make excuses to hate

So you can wait for your flowers until you're blue in the face, stupid

You ain't gonna get 'em until your funeral, wait (Hm)"

Long time no see (Ah)
Thought you got rid of my ass, huh? (Let me go, you sick fuck)
Alright, here's what we're gonna do (Piece of shit)
You take this (No)
Or I put a bullet between your fucking eyes (I don't wanna)

Here (Fuck no)

Then we'll split it (No)



Half an Ativan, I'm drivin' straight at a van

In a black Sedan, fast as I can

In Pakistan gettin' chased by a pack of Stans

You know how I roll, bitch (What?), I'm an avalanche

This my shit, I'm gonna spit it how I wanna spit it

Whoever gets offended, suck a dick and fuck a critic

'Bout to get retarded on this motherfuckin' shit, it

""You can't say retarded,"" shut up, midget (The fuck?)

And I've been tryna break the habit of sayin' any R words

But I'm still an addict, so it's getting harder (Ah)

Been callin' bitches ""hoеs"" since a kindergartner

This is Jimmy Cartеr, now I'm kitty-cornered (What?)

Sittin' in PC court with a shitty lawyer (Shit), like damn



You got an addiction, man (Ah)

I know you can't get rid of me forever

'Cause you know that I'm prescription, man

Goddamn, I miss you, Slim (Woo)

You got an addiction, man

I know you can't get rid of me forever

'Cause you know that I'm prescription, man

Next time, I'll be in your vein (Yeah)



Was just a kid from Detroit who knew how to destroy the booth

And had a point to prove (Yeah), and I'm missin' (What?)

Venomous, still I poison youth, sentences (Yeah)

I'm pennin' are just to toy with you

Which is a joy to do, Slim is just (What?)

A lyricist here to voice his true sentiments (Yeah), got the women pissed

And it seems like men are just (What?) off growing a huge clitoris (Pussies)

Yeah, I probably annoyed a few feminists

I reminisce on them blowing a fuse over my points of views

Still I'm devoid of two shits to give (Yeah)

My thinkin' is primitive

But when it comes to givin' it to anybody, boy, is Bruce generous (Marshall)

And I'm 'bout as much of boy as Bruce Jenner is (Damn)

'Cause I'm not a boy, I'm a man, bitch, man-bitch (Ha-ha)

My speech is free as his choice to choose gender is (Man)

This shit is like opioid abuse, isn't it? (Yup)



You got an addiction, man

I know you can't get rid of me forever

'Cause you know that I'm prescription, man

Goddamn, I miss you, Slim (Woo, uh)

You got an addiction, man

I know you can't get rid of me forever

'Cause you know that I'm prescription, man

Next time, I'll be in your veins



There's times when I lay down to sleep I argue with myself

Am I the only one who thinks it's weird? Do I need help?

Just a little bit, no, a lot of it, I really, really gotta quit

Something's wrong with me, my God, old habits die hard



Look at you

What's the matter with you people?

You're sad that people are mean?

Well, I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal arts college campus

**** you, you're all pricks



Mom shaming, dad shaming (Ah), yeah

Fat shaming (What?), man-splaining, blah (Pfft)

Cry babies attack Shady, wah

Mad 'cause they can't tame me (Get it)

Here come the censors (Look out), like the Avengers

And they assemble like Prince and then turn

A word like ""ginger"" into the N-word

All these pronouns (Ah) I can't remember (Damn)

They or them, theirs? (Who?) His or him, hers? (Ah)

Into them girls who bought tits to get attention

Then get hit on by ugly men who are (Creep)

Not in your league, so you pretend you're a victim

And me-too 'em (Ah), outraged, how fake? (What?)

Nowadays, some gals, they (What?) just clout-chase (Yeah)

Look at me with sour grapes and your brow raised

Bitch, you ain't about head (What?), about face (Woo)

Little white, middle-age, upper-middle-class

With a glass of wine and your cigarette

Bitch, get off the internet (Yeah)

You ain't even fed your kids dinner yet (Still)

Parental discretion, mental aggression, my head's a Smith & Wesson

You're messin' with a lethal weapon, like an evil stepdad

I got an infrared like the ginger stepkid who pissed the bed

I do this shit in jest and it's just a messin' up with your head

And if men wanna wear lipstick and women's underwear

Who cares? Their shit is their business, now bear witness

Beware, bitches, the Blair Witch on you scared bitches

I'm surreptitious (What?) on square business

Just attacked my therapist with a pair of scissors like ""Merry Christmas""

Dressed as a Hare Krishna, terrorist with a hair trigger (Woo)

But with these buttons I'm always pushing (Yeah), pain I'm always inflicting (What?)

Protestors outside the Shady offices livid (Yeah)

It'll make you think that you had the game on lock 'til they pick it (Trick it)

Only way for me to explain it is I'm conflicted (What?)

Walkin' on eggshells, like if I take it too far, is this it? (Yeah)

Part of me gets it and wants to say I'm sorry and fix it (I'm so—)

So all my statements are basically contradictive (What?)

Like using the F-word for gay is wrong and offensive (What?)

And insensitive as if me sayin' the R-word isn't (Wait)

Wait a minute, which R-word? Rape or retarded, midget? (Not cool, guys)

Would this rhyme be okay if South Park had did it? (Okay, screw you guys)

Would it make you less angry if Cartman spit it? (Goddammit)

And as far as what I just stated, regarding midgets

You'll probably think I'll just say that I'm playin', I'm not, I meant it (Yeah)

Swear to God I see one of them little fuckers come at me

I'll pick it up by its legs and drop it and kick it

""Marshall, you're wicked, face it, you are addicted"" (I know)

But they gon' do me the same as DaBaby with all of this shit (Why?)

Chappelle and Colin, they're callin' Shady misogynistic

While raisin' three daughters, two graduated from college with honor

Summa cum laude, my sense of humor is probably twisted

It's painfully obvious-tic



You got an addiction, man

I know you can't get rid of me forever

'Cause you know that I'm prescription, man

Goddamn, I miss you Slim (Woo, hey)

You got an addiction, man

I know you can't get rid of me forever

'Cause you know that I'm prescription, man

Next time, I'll be in your veins (Haha)



I'm just playin', little people, you know I love you"

Everybody on the dance floor, come on
That means you too, Chris
Haha
Well, it's Friday night, no date for the prom

Just got caught jackin' off by your mom

Suspended from school for settin' off the alarm

Kim Jong keep screamin' he gon' drop the bomb

But anyway, every day is the same old shiddit

Room lookin' like a tornado hit it

Try to explain, your parents, they don't get it

Time to hit you with a funky dope rhythm

Let it roll, if you ready, we gon' start the show

Everybody in the world, all across the globe

You can feel it in your head down to your toes

Dance until you're wheelchair bound, here we go

Yеah, horseback, little do-si-do

Little bit of soul mixеd with some rodeo

Everybody in the world's gonna laugh to this

Shit, I'll probably end up crippled after this, come on



Clap your hands and stomp your feet

Everybody join together

Can you feel the funky beat?

Everywhere you see people laughing and

Dancing in the street

On the count of three, everybody do

The Christopher Reeves

One, two, three, follow me



Superman, Batman, Spider-Man

Slipped, fell, landed in a garbage can

Shit, hell, damn it, I can hardly stand

But I get it crackin' like no one in the party can

Give me a beat, I'll show you all a brand new dance

All I need is a stretcher and an ambulance

Now stand back, kids, don't try this at home

Chi-boom, kick-boom, ooh, ah-oh

It's a brand new craze and it's sweepin' the nation

Anything else is a cheap imitation

Just make sure that you videotape it

You can only do it once 'fore the people go apeshit

It's a crowd favorite, a party pleaser

It's better than shake of a grand mal seizure

So next time that you see grandma, tease her

And roll up with a fresh set of wheels all greased up



Clap your hands and stomp your feet

Everybody join together

Can you feel the funky beat?

Everywhere you see people laughing and

Dancing in the street

On the count of three, everybody do

The Christopher Reeves

One, two, three, follow me



If your arms, legs, feet, and your hands are numb

You've fallen and you can't get up

It's a brand new dance, this is my Chris anthem, I'm

Givin' Chris Reeves his chrysanthemums



I'ma have everybody jumpin' to this

Caitlyn Jenner in the front row pumpin' her fists

With a simple little twist and a flick of the wrist

A little snap of the neck and a slip of the disc

You just pull up a chair and grab a seat

And clap your hands and stomp your feet

Or stomp your hands and clap your feet

Flop around 'til you lookin' like a slab of meat

You put your left foot back, your right in front

Tip your head back, let it touch your butt

'Til you feel a lil' pop, like what the fuck?

Motherfuck, fuck a duck, what the fuck? I'm stuck

So, party people, are you with me? What's the deal?

If you real, grab your chair up by the wheel

If you wanna feel just like the Man of Steel

Windmillin' on a million banana peels, come on



Clap your hands and stomp your feet

Everybody join together

Can you feel the funky beat?

Everywhere you see people laughing and

Dancing in the street

On the count of three, everybody do

The Christopher Reeves

One, two, three, follow me



Woo

Good morning, Eminem

Or Marshall, as others have informed me

Christopher Reeves here

You had better not talk behind my back

Or I will kick your ass the minute I'm out of this chair

Watch yourself, Marshall

I'm watching you

By the way, I think I just gave Skylar Gray Hepatitis A (Ew)

But when it's sink-or-swim, I just say, ""It's not me, it's him"" (Sorry)

There's a demon who's deep within

Shit can get a lot worse, these are my first thoughts, Johnny Walker, this my third shot (Yeah)

And I don't stop 'til the shots heard, pops for blocks, got the Mossberg cocked (What?)

Couple choppers, two Glocks, a 2Pac shirt, doctors, and boxers dropped

Lookin' awkward as I walk into Oxford (Stop, the fuck?)

So much ammunition, I sweat lead

And just bought you a new bedspread for your deathbed (Haha)

And I just got it made like Special Ed said

Word to Redman, I'm a meth-head

Used to get fed pet meds by my redneck stepdad

'Til I beat his ass to death with a cassette deck (Ah)

So much bloodshed that when he bled from his head gash (Yeah)

It's kinda like I'm a bookworm (Huh?)

'Cause I ain't stoppin' 'til everything gets read

Call this sex ed with a splash of necrophilia (What?)

'Cause when I say that I'm really the evilest, I'm fuckin' deadass (I'm fuckin' deadass, haha)

Maybe what I need now more than likely's a psych eval'

We squashed the beef like a hamburger patty, or should I say gigantic turd?

'Cause I put that shit to bed like Amber Heard at a Mattress Firm (Slut)



But if this is what he'd do to his mom (Pfft)

Imagine what he'd do to you (Haha), I'm a lunatic armed

And if it's you I used to clip on, for you to respond is ludicrous

Ma, look at what your uterus spawned: Lucifer



This must be a cold day in Hell (Hell)

Tell me what have we done? (Whoa)

Take me out of my misery

I bought Heaven when it was up for sale

And now I need a refund, bae (Yeah)



So whether you friend or you are foe (Whoa)

Far as bars go, even fuckin' retards know (Yeah)

That as far as smoke with me, I don't think it'd be smart, so (Oh)

Might as well go lookin' for smoke with Lamar, bro (Yeah), but, Marshall

You're gettin' more perverse every time you record a verse, and

It's like you came from 2000, stepped out a portal cursin'

Hurlin' horrible slurs towards the world, and

Why can't you make fun of people behind their backs like a normal person?

But when you reach these heights, freedom of speech dies (What?)

With every line that I recite, them PC police try

To throw me in jail with no bail like a peace prize

For all of them years (What?), they reduced me to tears (Yeah)

Tried to shrink me to pea-sized, only to see my (What?)

Self-esteem rise, now these are my replies (Mm)

They made me eat shit (Shit), I fed it back to 'em three times (Yeah)

Stepfather's the only (What?) one I ever been beat by (Haha)

Squeeze mics like Burmese pythons (Yeah), here's for each time (What?)

You sleep on the flow (What?), ho, you hear these strings climb (Yeah)

You reap what you sow (So what?), so first I must weave rhymes (Yeah)

So seamlessly, then I'ma leave eyes in a state of disbelief

My genius is a trait, so the gap's in our genes, right? (Haha, the gap)

At least, that's what it seems like

And I'm Lucifer and Dre is the producer for the Antichrist"

They're putting words in my mouth like alphabet soup

Got the most content on the continent

And constant compliments give me confidence (I'ma)

Across the common sense and incompetence (Uh)

Incognizant, the conflict's are consequence

Of accomplishments that conference through compeitish

Why does it feel like I'm always being tortured?

The bad apple spoils the whole orchard

Used to read comic books to learn more words

'Cause deep down I'm a dork, just a core nerd

Meaning nerds are the core, 'til I'm cornered

Then I'm the coroner

What shot is this? First, second, it's your third

Vision is more blurred

Speech is more slurred

Can't evеn form words

It's like a dream up inside of a drеam

I'm trapped and it's worse than I could've imagined, it's madness

Can't wake up, try my damnedest, but old habits are coming back

And now transgenders attack us, frontwards and backwards

They laughin', throwin midgets at us (Ha)

This ain't no dream now, huh? See what I mean now?

You see how they tryna make me out to be some kind of mean vile obscene, foul prick

I kick one freestyle 'bout beating down a special needs child and these people freak out

Told you we'd get slaughtered for saying ""Retarded""

Aw, Marshall's gaining a conscience (Fuck you)

Fuck, this may come as a shock

I have you astonished regardless

Here's the thing about retarded people

What?

They don't fucking know they're retarded

Well, okay, you wanna fat shame, bitch

Two can play that game

You wanna judge people? (Yeah)

Matter of fact, ain't you the same one who hated bullies calling you bad names? (Yep)

Then you turn around and did the exact same (So?)

Just immature, literally

You're still mentally thirteen

And still thirsty for some controversy

You still picking on Christopher Reeves

Yeah, but you're me

And we're a team

So that means, we're in cahoots

That's conspiracy to commit murder

Lyrically, so clearly, you're the accessory, like jewelry

You ain't the judge or the jury, you're just as guilty

You rip on paraplegics, man, seriously?

Oh, bitch, it's a joke

No, it's not, it's embarrassing (What?)

I know, it's a scary scene

They're coming with everything

Little people are trolling me (Ha)

They saying they've had it up to here with me (What?)

Oh, hilarity (Come on)

Nah, do your thing

Fuck deaf people, yeah

Well, between me and you

I've think they've had it up to here with me too

What the fuck?

Sorry I'm not perfect as you, Marshall

Punching down on little people (Yeah), not cool

You just sound like a dick, wait, nah, fool (What?)

When I say, ""Fuck midgets,"" I mean Ja Rule (Oh)

That's why your satire backfires (Yeah)

Flat tires, no longer that guy you were prior to this, yeah

And I scare you 'cause (Why?)

I'm who you used to be (Who?)

The you who didn't crumble under the scrutiny (What?)

When it was you and me (Yeah)

I gave you power to use me as an excuse to be evil (I know)

You created me to say everything you didn't have the balls to say (Yep)

What you were thinking but in a more diabolic way

You fed me pills and a bottle of alcohol a day (Okay)

Made me too strong for you and lost control of me (You're right)

I took over you totally

You were socially awkward 'til you molded me (Yeah)

You was a loner and nobody

'Cause of me, you didn't take shit from nobody

Now look at you (What?)

Now you just a punk (Man), little scaredy cat (Word)

Got you shook like Shakira's ass (Yeah)

To look at your reflection staring back, bitch

It's just a mirror, relax

Man, you're so full of shit, you need MiraLAX

Open your mouth and shit flies out, just lies

You thinkin' you can rip my ass, undo these zipties

You can just undo my feet and keep my hands tied

'Cause like an avalanche, I'd still win by a landside

Okay, your hands and feet, I let 'em both go

Yeah, fuck now, ho, give me that gun, no, don't

Rear naked choke hold, let me go, yo

Here, take it, bozo (Yeah)

Weird bait, you homo (You ready?)

No, don't shoot (Here we go)

Bro, no, no

Now say you're sorry and you didn't mean any of it

I'm sorry, Marshalls a pussy, he's Dre and Jimmy's puppet

Sorry he gives a fuck, but pretends he doesn't

God, you piece of shit, that does it (Uh-oh)

Yeah, bitch, this is for him

Christopher, MGK, Nick, and for Limp Bizkit and them

Midgets and Ben— (Man, please)

'Zino, in addition to him

So to Jamar and Ja Rule and to all my feuds including ma (What?)

I'm welcoming you to my (No, no)

Last hoorah, I bid you goodbye (Come on, man, don't do this) murder suicide

Killshot, booyaka, cock sucker

Coupe de grace, motherfucker



Oh, what the fuck?

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Yeah?

Paul, your not gonna fucking believe this bro

I had this dream, it was fucking crazy

It was like, the old me came back and the new me

And took over my brain and had me saying all this fucked up shit

About little people and Caitlyn Jenner and

PC Police were chasing me

And fucking Gen Z was tryna kill me

And quadriplegics

And Christopher Reeves

And I was saying all this fucked up shit

To see some shit that'd make you faint like you're fakin' a jab (Pussy)

Bitch, you wish you had a life like mine (Yeah)

You just fantasize the shit you write, you guys like lying (Yeah)

Everything you ever been through multiplied by nine (What?)

Ain't even half the shit I went through by the time I was five (Like, what?)

Saw my uncle get stabbed, took a knife right in the abs (Yeah)

And all he was tryna do was get my tricycle back, yeah

The one that Boogie, Malcolm and Isaac just jacked

After they jumped me and stomped me (Boom) and hit me twice with a bat (Ugh)

Was five and a half, second time I survived an attack

Two twins, they call themselves the bulldogs (Hrr), white kids and fat

I was too frightened to scrap (Ha), I didn't fight or hit back

And you wonder why is it that? I treat a mic like a gat

Fully loaded, but I pull it, a bullet from out a barrel the size (Brr) of a derringer flies

That's how I would characterize lyrics

But America, I could see the fear in your eyes

You saw my terrible side, the blonde hair and blue eyes

Now, the writing is on the wall like graffiti still

If you're havin' trouble reading, will make it simple, he's Ezekiel

Easy name to remember (Why?)

'Cause his rap name is the same as like ten minutes on stage is for me (Oh), easy mill

Or should I say measly mill? (Haha)

Yeah, 'cause as sure as Ma used to feed me

Sleeping pills to keep me (Yeah), sleepy still, it was creepy

'Cause indeed, she (What?) could've easily Casey Anthony'd me (Yeah)

These rappers, I'm above 'em, but punchin' down ain't beneath me (Nope)

Cold as the wind chill factor, but the fact is I don't know when to chill

But every time I come out, they expect me to fuckin' reinvent the wheel

Rappers get praised for spittin' bars with less than the tenth of skill

Imbecile on the ledge like a Benzo pill on a windowsill

Now cancelled ain't the word for me

You need a term that's probably stronger than dirty laundry (Hell)

This controversy got me in the worst of quandaries

Feel like the Earth's axis, the world's turnin' on me

Like them cops in Akron, Ohio with Jayland Walker

Ain't caught this much flak in a while (Nah) since back as a child (Damn)

And all I did was say like one thing bad then it spiraled

Saw you crackin' a smile (Haha), and relapsed into my old ways

Back into vile (Yup)

Guess there ain't no civilizin' a savage, and I don't (No)

Give a fuck if you hate me worse than these track on Revival (Huh)

Bitch, I'm back like a spinal (Yeah), get it crackin' like chiros

It's the coup de grâce, I'm cooler than removin' claws from a cougar's paws and throwin' it back in the wild (Fuck)

But you tamin' me? Ain't gonna happen, and I'll

Live on planet denial (Ha) for the rest of my life

But you be a stan 'til I die, though (Ha)"

The truth is, I think what scares me the most is not being able to say all the things I wanna say to you when I'm no longer here
So this song is for Hailie, for when that day comes
Where's Hailie? Where's she at?
This ain't Hailie
Who is it?

It's a monster



I've been waiting all night for the sunrise

To take away the dark sky

You're the dad monster and them are the baby monsters and I'm the mom monster

Oh

All it takes is a new day sometimes

To get me in a better state of mind

Give me a kiss, monster, give me a kiss

Love you

I love you



If I could just fall asleep

I'd be lost in a dream

But right now, it's misery

And I just have to remember



That when a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever

The pieces will grow back together

And in time, I'll be fine

The tears are temporary



Yeah, so Hailie Jade, I wrote you this song

To help you cope with life now that I'm gone

How should I start? Just wanna say

Look after Alaina, Stevie, and Uncle Nate

And, sweetie, be strong, I know I was your rock

And I still am, saying goodbye is just not

Ever easy, why you crying? Just stop

Hailie, baby, dry your eye, this is not

Forever



That when a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever

The pieces will grow back together

And in time, I'll be fine

The tears are temporary



Daddy (Ooh)

What? (Ooh)

I used to have this when I was a little kid (Ooh)

Baby, are you okay? (Ooh)



Yeah, and you will get over me and move on

You can play me on repeat on a song

But don't you dare shed a tear, what I tell you?

""Straighten up, little soldier,"" them times when I held you

Jade, it'll be okay, baby, I'm here, Hay

I'm watchin' you right now, baby girl, I vow

I will protect you, tour guardian angel

As hard as this may feel, as parting is painful

And, darling, the rain will, drive you insane still

You will remain strong, Hailie, just hang on

It won't be too long, I need you to move on

And remember, it will get better

'Cause times heals and when a



When a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever

The pieces will grow back together

And in time, I'll be fine

The tears are temporary

The bad days will start to get better

And we'll be laughin' together

And tonight, when I cry

The tears are temporary



I know this big girl (Ooh)

And she's really pretty (Ooh)

You know what her name is?

Hailie (Ooh)

Hailie, how did you know? (Ooh)



Yeah, and if there's days when you wanna lock yourself in your room and cry

Just think about how when you were little, how you and I

Back and forth to the studio, we used to drive

You strapped in the backseat 'cause you were my

Little sidekick, yeah, sweetie, I know this hurts

Bean, I'm wishing your pain away

Remember this, Hailie Jade

There's gonna be rainy days

I promise you'll get through 'em and make it regardless

Fuck it, Jade, I'll be honest

I knew that you was gonna take this the hardest

Sweetie, get up, I know that is is breaking your heart, it's

The hardest thing I ever wrote (Daddy)

Hailie, sweetheart, it's okay for you to let me go

Baby, I promise you that when a—



When a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever

The pieces will grow back together

And in time, I'll be fine

The tears are temporary

The bad days will start to get better

And we'll be laughin' together

And tonight when I cry

The tears are temporary



What's your favorite song? (Ooh)

My favorite song right now (Ooh)

Mine and your favorite song, but

I like this part

That's your favorite part, dad? (Ooh)



You're taping me, bitch

I got you on tape cussin'

Can you hear?

Yeah

No, bitch

No what?

No, I said, I said no, bitch

Okay, no cussin'"

Yeah
I'ma just lay back on this one
Let me apologize in advance (I like that)
Fuck it, forgive me (Alright)
Fuck it, I don't mean to sound (You ready?) arrogant (Fuck it, yeah) but



Yeah, my head up in the sky again

But even that, my stacks are higher than

Money pile like Tony Stark's, that's how much I earn, man

Girl, my head is small, I feel incredible as the Hulk

Meaning I'm trying to smash

So come get in line like Santa and climb up inside my lap

While I devise a plan

Won't be talkin' about Purell when Santa ties your hands

And I am an

Industrial-strength heightened brand

Frying pan

Rap is something that I've just had the skillet for some timing, am

An artist who can draw a crowd like a diagram

Like drawing breath from your diaphragm

I've achieved every aspiration that I have had

Got a diamond plaque or two or three or four

But that don't change my attitude, I got a bad one



I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one



Yeah

One minute, you're here, next minute, you're gone, don't sit there and scoff

Lil' bitch, you can knock the shit about me being immature off

It isn't my fault, the liquor is often twisting my thoughts

You said you're looking for miniature golf

I thought you said looking for men to jerk off

Your mouth is a hole (What?), that means my dick is engulfed

Sick as a dog with croup cough (What?)

Biggie is gone and Tupac (Yeah)

And I'm still alive and you not the woo, dog

So who died and made you God?

Anything can set my mood off, attitude, I've always had one

My temper is like the bitch I just scooped up, I got a bad one



I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one



Yeah, this whole sub-genre with all these corny white rappers, I'm not a fan of it

It ain't my fault, but like sock puppets, I had a hand in it

This thousand bucks in my hand is just like what Candace did

When she turned her back on her own race 'cause I have abandoned it

One of the greatest who did it, look what I came up through

You never made it to the level that I made it to

So similar to a dinner table, I ate at you (Sorry)

Haters, I made a few

But like when Three Stacks just plays the flute

I ain't got shit to say to you (Nah)

And me offending you's nothing new (Nah)

Fuck it, it's what I love to do

This is subterfuge, just to screw with you

And yeah, this much is true

This sounds like something that Puff would do

At the party with Aaron Hall 'cause I just love to fuck with you (Woah)

A line of blush, foundation kit

'Cause it's you I make upset

Brain is dead, space cadet

Like when Ye forgets to take his meds

So when they get mad or angry at

A statement that I may have said

I just say, ""Man, I didn't say that shit, Shady did""

'Cause all I do is write the rhymes and then wait for that beat to play, spit 'em

Trigger finger, make like a green beret like he would get a submachine to spray with 'em

I should go back to those sleeping aids

Because I'm so stuck in my evil ways

Then I'm fucked either way

The people still seem to think they want the old me 'til they get him

Got 'em up in arms like monkey bars

The fucking bomb with the puffy on

I'm blowing up for Kid Cudi's car

In front of his house where all his buddies are

Just another day at the office, but it seems like Marsh's fucking job is done

Mission accomplished, people off this stunt

And pissed a billion people off at once (Yeah)

But I gotta keep going Tyson on Kelly (What?)

I bodied him twice and already

That little motherfucker's back throwing subs (Like what?) like a food fight at the deli

And that is why E got the attitude he got like Liza Minnelli

My male ego

Is the size of the belly on Jelly Roll

And bitch, I got a bad one



I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one"

Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat

White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope

No español, I'm allergic to rojo and legally blind, all I'm seein' is ""go""

D to the A, there and back, if we ride with the Drac', can't smoke from the T to the O

Upped in the bitch, you can keep what you owe

Granny told me, ""Boy, you reap what you sow""

Do the most, we over-even the score

Said he on the run, glued his feet to the floor

Up in my Tesla, I'm rollin' up 'Ishers, I stopped at Valero, think I should quit smokin'

Life is a gamble and I'm playin' slots, pull it down, close my eyes and I pray I win tokens

All Wock', no pop, how we drive, you can come and take a baby sip, still taste that it's potent

One of one, sittin' 'round the stars, double R, finna race, hit the Wraith, like a spaceship it's floatin'

All this drip, think I am below sea level

Cut your own wrist off with that weak bezel

Ride around with the Iron Giant, make 'em eat metal

Watch unc' break a rock down to three pebbles

Bam-bam, down three, hit the grand slam

Four pockets full, fully switched, go wham-wham

Pants cramp, pull it out, I'm countin' 'til my hands cramp

Wrote ""DSM"" on the beach, now the sand stamped



Boy

Ayy, ayy



They wanna bleed me and lead me to act like they need me, but fuck it, I do it alone (Woah)

She wanna touch me and rub me and go back to hubby, he probably could smell my cologne (Damn)

I was immersed in the Murcié, I show 'em no mercy, I really was watchin' the throne (For real)

Niggas ain't turnin' me down, when my baby asleep only time that I'm watchin' my tone, look (Shh)

We don't want chips with a chip on our shoulder

If he Obi-Wan, then I gotta be Yoda

Don't need no promoter, we pull up, they know us

I'm the Ayatollah snatching your controller

I don't give a fuck about you when I'm focused

Fuck all the drugs you take, I'm takin' over

I paid attention, don't need no payola

Can't take 'way from me, you just need to take cover (Frr)

I can paint a picture like I made the stencil

Fuck your whole image, I'm with Cole Bennett

I don't know what the fuck they done told niggas

I put all of my heart and my soul in it

I met you in person, you so different

I can't listen to you for a whole minute

Took a blood test, ain't no ho in it

Watch your motherfuckin' mouth 'fore I go in it

They like, ""No, he didn't,"" got 'em more invested

If it's one thing I make, I make no exceptions

I got new addresses, I got no reception

I got love and hate comin' from both directions

Bitch, I come from the D where they BMFing

Where they movin' them keys like a chord progression

Bitch, I'm omnipresent, I got no reflection

Made a livin' off bars, I need no correction (No)

Grindin' shit out, gotta stay patient

While you outside, we on staycation

Locked the fuck in, ain't no playin' for real 'less you playmakin'

I take the chances you hate takin'

Fuck it, dog, I'ma go Wes Craven

I'm at the safe, fuck a safe haven

Y'all thought you were sick, you were misdiagnosed (Nope)

I'm dope and you'll never have this high a dose (Nope, yeah)

Now my estates in the buildin', and bitch, I done slept on more floors than the Empire State ('Pire State) Building

I got so many stories, but I hate ceilings (Haha)

Ain't feelin' your top five favorite rappers (Woo)

So I know they 'bout to be pissed at me (Why?)

But this, to me, is a mystery

How rappers I've already ripped could be (What?)

Higher up on a list than me (Ha)

Yet here I sit on your list though at five (Hm), which still is fine

But just know inside, to me, that shit's hilarious, so when I (Haha)

Get dissed though and by a pioneer

Who was one of the reasons why I am here

They tell me I should just let that shit go and slide (Why?)

""Melle Mel shouldn't get no reply"" (Why?)

""That man is a legend,"" bitch, so am I (Haha, yeah)

And anyone else who thinks it'd be wise and easy as pie

To beat me and tries, can treat me just like poison (What?), they can eat me and die (Hehe)

Middle finger stuck up, but I never conceded

When have I ever retreated? (Never) You never seen it

Every dream that I ever dreamt, I exceeded

Cement my legacy, I definitely did controversy, I always fed on, I need it

Treat it like a truck, hit it head-on, I meet it (Krrk)

I get on a beat and it's like that ""Eye of the Tiger"" song is playin' on my head on repeat

I been knocked down so many times, can't count (Ugh)

Sometimes, shit does not pan out

That's just the way that the card hand's dealt

Jon Manziel, odd man out (What?)

But heavyweight, word to Scott Van Pelt

I can't help but feel like a victim of child abuse

'Cause I am 'bout to get that goddamn belt (Now strap, man)

Way beyond crazy, Shady gone, but hey, maybe, I am the goat

Didn't walk you down the aisle

I've been starin' at that video of Hailie

Almost daily of her playin' a guitar

In hopes maybe that'll give me the power to fight

But the addict in me's a coward, he told me that I can't do it

Had a second chance, blew it

It's like I'm stuck inside an alternate reality, but I know (What?)

I'll turn it around and be able to

Walk her and Lainie one day

To the altar as proud as can be

Right now, I'm just weak

As I fall further down in this deep hole

And farther in the ground that I sink

As they lower me in my coffin, I feel the tears all fallin' down on my cheek



I'm a lost cause

Baby, don't waste your time on me

I'm so damaged beyond repair

Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams

Lately, it's been goin', goin', goin', goin', goin' down
Come see how heavy it get, I done seen way to much stress as a jit
Death in this section was present, we preppin' for war, so we feel like we better equipped
Brodie got demons he keep to his self, probably won't ever know, 'cause he never gon' snitch

We preppin' for war, so we feel like we better equipped

Brodie got demons he keep to his-self, probably won't ever know, 'cause he never gon' snitch

Hella resentment from lettin' it sit, I say ""I got him,"" I'm never gon' miss

I done put way too much prep into this, back on your bumper how I'm wreckin' this bitch

I keep on talkin' 'bout healin' that's never gon' happen, you know that I'm steppin' on shit

I say the feelin' I get from me killin' a rapper just show me that Heaven exist

Shootin' 'til ain't nothin' left in the clip, shootin' 'til I get respect in this bitch

I might just go get a TEC in this bitch, I might just go at the ref in this bitch

Guessing you think this shit new to me, huh? Guess you ain't know what's fuelin' me, huh?

I just had enemies shoot at me, tell me, just what could this industry do to me, huh?

Helpin' the hood and the homies and plus the community think that it's two of me, huh?

Know where I go when it's over, I run out of gas, they gon' say that they through with me, huh? Aw, shit

When all this shit gon' get better? Bitches just fuckin' whoever

Nigga just sayin' whatever, niggas' gon' fold under pressure, honestly I ain't no better

I had to hop out the hole and got cold as a shoulder, I turned my emotion into sweater

I had to garner the power to work on my soul, I ain't tryna be broken forever

I see the smoke, and start runnin' into it, shawty you losin' is so therapeutic

I kinda think that you want it to happen, got put in a corner, you forced me to do it

You gotta tell me that bein' a rapper is hangin' with rappers, and I ain't into it

I'm with the shit, and I'm ready to prove it, waitin' on Marshall to say I can do it

This shit goin' down, down, down, down, dow-dow-dow-dow



If I run out of fuel, I won't

What the fuck y'all gon' do if I don't

Run out of fuel? (Down, down, down, down, dow-dow-dow-dow—)

That scares the fuck out of you



Look, I was slept on and left for dead

Sweat, wept, and bled for a game that barely kept me fed

Ain't want the fame, just a spec of cred

Nowadays I take a check instead

The pen been steps ahead

If you mention him, them boys wet the bed

Get on a track with GRIP and get knocked out like yo' daddy did

Whatever Deebo said to Craig, we can go head to head

Niggas play hard on the app

At they mama crib hatin' on bars in a rap

From niggas that still starve in the trap

Clap back and it's, ""GRIP, you're takin' it too far, just relax""

These words I discard on the wax

Shit deeper than the cars and the racks

The fashion and gas, so when a star interacts

Got the soul of a field nigga with scars on his back

So pardon me if part of me feel a itch to click

Pitch a fit, blitz a bitch, split ya shit

GRIP in the kitchen with instant grits

Flick the wrist, they wish he'd miss, he's six for six

Go back through the discog'

It's obvious I'm the godliest, yeah, I'm sonnin' y'all

I took the summer off

Just to let them get they mumbles off about blocks that they ain't spun at all

The uninvolved underdog

Summoned from a drunken slumber to pummel y'all, but they don't wanna brawl

This shit ain't even fun no more

I mean, don't nobody wanna come outside

They like, ""You should do a song with so and so

Or maybe such and such,"" this shit done, I tried

They must not got it in their arsenal or metacarpal

To pick the pen up and out-ink the man

Hm, but then again I'm partial

It really took Marshall just for me to get a feature? Damn

I know rap's what I started with

But when your target market's lethargic to the bars you spit

It's harder to put your heart in it

But come too far to quit, now I'm on to guitars and shit

So don't find it jarrin' if I switch the whole style up

Want the old GRIP? Go get the old album

Any genre, same outcome

I'm on that bitch with a stick like Malcolm

Buck, buck, buck, buck

Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck



If I run out of fuel, I won't

What the fuck y'all gon' do if I don't

Run out of fuel? (Down, down, down, down, dow-dow-dow-dow—)

That scares the fuck out of you



I was up to my waist in debt, better yet, face and neck, tryna chase a check

Sweat, labor for minimal as wages get, just tryna get me a dub like a blank cassette (Yeah)

I worked for peanuts 'til the day I met Dre and that gave me a little Raisinet

Now nothing is close to disgusting as what I grossed, so this must mean what I wrote makes me the

Illest rapper there is, was, or ever will be

That's the real reason I still squeeze and I fill these bars with so much vitriol

These voices in my head convince me, I bet that Ted Kaczynski'll feel me

'Cause I serial kill beats like it's real keys

My peripheral sees everything, you was POVs to rap G-O-D

From Little Caesars to filled arenas, I made it big, word to Lil' Cease

""Fuel"" remix, so who'll be picked next, who's name gonna be next up?

Notorious B.I.G.'s death was the domino effects of 2Pac's murder

Like facial tissue, who's card should I clean next? Puff's?

'Til he's in police handcuffs, guilty, will he step up?

Like gee, never turned himself in, who knows all the murders there'll have been

Or me mixed up, prepare for me to not choose none of my words carefully

I've been comparable to Ivan The Terrible, I'll take a paraplegic

And I'll slam his wheelchair on the cement at physical therapy treatment

Then laugh hysterically, these wimps are like Slim's hair when he bleached it

Y'all need to lighten up, I give a fuck, I don't care in the least bit

Kiss every square inch of my white rear end, I guarantee that

My elevator's stuck somewhere between two levels emcee's won't ever see

I spit bars so barbarically, a fuckin' parakeet wouldn't dare repeat

I'll never be runnin' out of steam or kerosene



If I run out of fuel, I won't

What the fuck y'all gon' do if I don't

Run out of fuel? (Down, down, down, down, dow-dow-dow-dow—)

That scares the fuck out of you"

Two months my dad was outie (Bye), blew up, he bragged about me (Haha)

Talk about seizin' the moment (What?), it's like I have the Lawry's (Yeah)

I got jumped at Checkers (Rally's), but across the board, the game had to crown me (Yeah)

Man, I swear this shit is a trip (Trip), similar to a family outing (When I look)

When I look back at how these kid-kids in my class would clown me

Said I'm just a huge waste, well, that must make these rappers belts

Because now they all feel so small that they won't even wrap around me

Expect me to give in like a sinkhole (What?)

Stink, ho? Bitch, no, I don't think so

Like Cool J, back to Cali (What am I, nuts?)

Borderline nuts, but I have no boundaries

If you get in my way, I'ma bury ya

Like a barricade around this area

They call me the grand canal be-

Cause I'll be damned if rap ain't damned without me

Keep it a grand like a damn finale

Coup de grâce as I shot to superstardom

Who'd have thought what my medulla-oblongata screwed-up thoughts could do to toddlers?

But I grew up on ramen noodles, combination of post trauma due to mama

Got me off my rocker, human lama, but everything is not hakuna matata (Nah)

But I pour my heart into the ink in these letters

I tear you apart as I piece it together

How am I so sick if I keep getting better?

Bitch, you ain't fuckin' with me at this ever

You got no cheese and no cheddar

You need some yeast, at least get your bread up

I hit your bitch up like Pac, told her to please keep her head up (Head up, head up)

'Cause she was suckin' my dick in the Jeep when we met up

I show up like you just said speak of the devil

The devil is speaking, ""Now shut up,"" now shut up (Shh)

I'm tryin' to take rappers heads off (What?)

I'm out for blood like the Red Cross (Bitch)

Turn your GPS off and get lost (Right)

This TEC is not for no TED Talk (Brrt)

But every word that come from my lip bomb like I'm ChapStick

Seedy as a motherfuckin' compact disc, bombastic

I'm ahead of my time and my watch fast, bitch

I'm strapped, safety off that bitch

Hop back with this Papermate

The pen'll be the only thing I'm not cappin'

Better quit your goddamn jaw-jackin' (Yeah)

Used to write my raps on napkins (What?)

Too much paper, now I'm stackin'

And you can't take it like dog aspirin (Haha)

Ain't alcohol, but I'm strong as it

If rap was liquor, this song has it (Yeah)

So if you don't wanna get wasted

With balls in his durag, he sags, fearin' no man
He stands, pen in his hand like Edward Scissorhands
Will slice competition and just goes about his business
Anyone who knows about him knows about his shindig

Shenanigans, and all his whacky antics in the papers

Shank is danglin', the baby tangled in a blanket, stranglin'

I'm hangin' him over the railing by the ankles on some gangster shit

Child endangerment, dark brain arcane but it Mark Twainin' it

You aren't tamin' it, sharp pain in the heart

Aimin' a bar chain but it carve names in it

Start sprayin' and start ravin' 'em, you starve, ravin' it

You're at arm's length, you're in harm's way of it

'Bout to show your ass why I'm still a pain in it

You wanna know how I do it? I can't explain this shit

Mechanic's brain with a pinch of Big Daddy Kane in it

But I can show you the ropes 'til you get the hang of it

Elephant's eye, this of the tough element

Of intelligent hoodlum, arrested development

Cellar dwellers and wise intelligence, it's elementary

Through hell I went, accelerate from lack of melanin

Failin' in school, smart eloquent

Help me to rebel against shit, so well and bent

So eloquently, yet, I was irrelevant

Soon as I quit givin' a fuck and started to sell a bit

Now just travel inside the mind of a hater

'Cause I don't see no fans, all I see's a bunch of complainers

""Kendrick's album was cool but it didn't have any bangers""

""Wayne's album or Ye's, couldn't tell you which one was lamer""

""Joyner's album was corny, Shady's new shit is way worse""

""Everything is either too tame or there's too much anger""

""I didn't like the beef so I hated Might Delete Later""

You nerdy pricks would find somethin' wrong with 36 Chambers

So what they do for the greats? Pick the part of Picasso and make excuses to hate

So you can wait for your flowers until you're blue in the face, stupid

You ain't gonna get 'em until your funeral, wait (Hm)"

Whoever gets offended, suck a dick and fuck a critic

'Bout to get retarded on this motherfuckin' shit, it

""You can't say retarded,"" shut up, midget (The fuck?)

And I've been tryna break the habit of sayin' any R words

But I'm still an addict, so it's getting harder (Ah)

Been callin' bitches ""hoеs"" since a kindergartner

This is Jimmy Cartеr, now I'm kitty-cornered (What?)

Sittin' in PC court with a shitty lawyer (Shit), like damn

Was just a kid from Detroit who knew how to destroy the booth

And had a point to prove (Yeah), and I'm missin' (What?)

Venomous, still I poison youth, sentences (Yeah)

I'm pennin' are just to toy with you

Which is a joy to do, Slim is just (What?)

A lyricist here to voice his true sentiments (Yeah), got the women pissed

And it seems like men are just (What?) off growing a huge clitoris (Pussies)

Yeah, I probably annoyed a few feminists

I reminisce on them blowing a fuse over my points of views

Still I'm devoid of two shits to give (Yeah)

My thinkin' is primitive

But when it comes to givin' it to anybody, boy, is Bruce generous (Marshall)

And I'm 'bout as much of boy as Bruce Jenner is (Damn)

'Cause I'm not a boy, I'm a man, bitch, man-bitch (Ha-ha)

My speech is free as his choice to choose gender is (Man)

This shit is like opioid abuse, isn't it? (Yup)

There's times when I lay down to sleep I argue with myself

Am I the only one who thinks it's weird? Do I need help?

Just a little bit, no, a lot of it, I really, really gotta quit

Something's wrong with me, my God, old habits die hard



Look at you

What's the matter with you people?

You're sad that people are mean?

Well, I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal arts college campus

**** you, you're all pricks



Mom shaming, dad shaming (Ah), yeah

Fat shaming (What?), man-splaining, blah (Pfft)

Cry babies attack Shady, wah

Mad 'cause they can't tame me (Get it)

Here come the censors (Look out), like the Avengers

And they assemble like Prince and then turn

A word like ""ginger"" into the N-word

All these pronouns (Ah) I can't remember (Damn)

They or them, theirs? (Who?) His or him, hers? (Ah)

Into them girls who bought tits to get attention

Then get hit on by ugly men who are (Creep)

Not in your league, so you pretend you're a victim

And me-too 'em (Ah), outraged, how fake? (What?)

Nowadays, some gals, they (What?) just clout-chase (Yeah)

Look at me with sour grapes and your brow raised

Bitch, you ain't about head (What?), about face (Woo)

Little white, middle-age, upper-middle-class

With a glass of wine and your cigarette

Bitch, get off the internet (Yeah)

You ain't even fed your kids dinner yet (Still)

Parental discretion, mental aggression, my head's a Smith & Wesson

You're messin' with a lethal weapon, like an evil stepdad

I got an infrared like the ginger stepkid who pissed the bed

I do this shit in jest and it's just a messin' up with your head

And if men wanna wear lipstick and women's underwear

Who cares? Their shit is their business, now bear witness

Beware, bitches, the Blair Witch on you scared bitches

I'm surreptitious (What?) on square business

Just attacked my therapist with a pair of scissors like ""Merry Christmas""

Dressed as a Hare Krishna, terrorist with a hair trigger (Woo)

But with these buttons I'm always pushing (Yeah), pain I'm always inflicting (What?)

Protestors outside the Shady offices livid (Yeah)

It'll make you think that you had the game on lock 'til they pick it (Trick it)

Only way for me to explain it is I'm conflicted (What?)

Walkin' on eggshells, like if I take it too far, is this it? (Yeah)

Part of me gets it and wants to say I'm sorry and fix it (I'm so—)

So all my statements are basically contradictive (What?)

Like using the F-word for gay is wrong and offensive (What?)

And insensitive as if me sayin' the R-word isn't (Wait)

Wait a minute, which R-word? Rape or retarded, midget? (Not cool, guys)

Would this rhyme be okay if South Park had did it? (Okay, screw you guys)

Would it make you less angry if Cartman spit it? (Goddammit)

And as far as what I just stated, regarding midgets

You'll probably think I'll just say that I'm playin', I'm not, I meant it (Yeah)

Swear to God I see one of them little fuckers come at me

I'll pick it up by its legs and drop it and kick it

""Marshall, you're wicked, face it, you are addicted"" (I know)

But they gon' do me the same as DaBaby with all of this shit (Why?)

Chappelle and Colin, they're callin' Shady misogynistic

While raisin' three daughters, two graduated from college with honor

Summa cum laude, my sense of humor is probably twisted

It's painfully obvious-tic



You got an addiction, man

I know you can't get rid of me forever

I ain’t been out the house in a minute 'cause I ain’t wit' it if the money is miniature

I been mindin' my business, I'm business-mindin’

'Cause them niggas spinnin' shit and still sinnin' in the City of God and it's sinister

Try to pray and repent in a synagoguе or a mosque, a temple, a church

Thеm brown skin's seen many niggas hurtin'

And murder's a common courtesy, for certainly

My nigga doin' four plus eight without a court date

Talked the other day, he say he doin' okay

He good, he gainin' weight, then got a sharp shank

He made, he say they played, they gotta partake

Homie got a heart full of hate and a face full of war paint

Eyes all red, full of rage and it's hard to escape from a dark place

I don't condone gun violence at schools (Nah)

But I can't get these voices out my head (Hey, let's go, one, two)

They're putting words in my mouth like alphabet soup

Got the most content on the continent

And constant compliments give me confidence (I'ma)

Across the common sense and incompetence (Uh)

Incognizant, the conflict's are consequence

Of accomplishments that conference through compeitish

Through conscious, I conjure that

Nobodies sixteen's are touching

Clutchin' the nine millimeter, tuckin' the heat

Got the toaster like an English muffin

But it's in a holster, I proceed to bust it

Fuck around and get popped like Halyna Hutchins

Like I'm Alec Baldwin, what I mean is buckin' you down, coup de grâce then

Right between the fuckin'

Then I'm the coroner

What shot is this? First, second, it's your third

Vision is more blurred

Speech is more slurred

Can't evеn form words

It's like a dream up inside of a drеam

I'm trapped and it's worse than I could've imagined, it's madness

Can't wake up, try my damnedest, but old habits are coming back

And now transgenders attack us, frontwards and backwards

They laughin', throwin midgets at us (Ha)

This ain't no dream now, huh? See what I mean now?

You see how they tryna make me out to be some kind of mean vile obscene, foul prick

I kick one freestyle 'bout beating down a special needs child and these people freak out

Told you we'd get slaughtered for saying ""Retarded""

Aw, Marshall's gaining a conscience (Fuck you)

Fuck, this may come as a shock

I have you astonished regardless

Here's the thing about retarded people

What?

They don't fucking know they're retarded

Well, okay, you wanna fat shame, bitch

Two can play that game

You wanna judge people? (Yeah)

Matter of fact, ain't you the same one who hated bullies calling you bad names? (Yep)

Then you turn around and did the exact same (So?)

Just immature, literally

You're still mentally thirteen

And still thirsty for some controversy

You still picking on Christopher Reeves

Yeah, but you're me

And we're a team

So that means, we're in cahoots

That's conspiracy to commit murder

Lyrically, so clearly, you're the accessory, like jewelry

You ain't the judge or the jury, you're just as guilty

You rip on paraplegics, man, seriously?

Oh, bitch, it's a joke

No, it's not, it's embarrassing (What?)

Like David Carradine found with a pair of jeans at his ankles and belt around his larynx

I know, it's a scary scene

They're coming with everything

Little people are trolling me (Ha)

They saying they've had it up to here with me (What?)

Oh, hilarity (Come on)

Nah, do your thing

Fuck deaf people, yeah

Well, between me and you

I've think they've had it up to here with me too

What the fuck?

Sorry I'm not perfect as you, Marshall

Punching down on little people (Yeah), not cool

You just sound like a dick, wait, nah, fool (What?)

When I say, ""Fuck midgets,"" I mean Ja Rule (Oh)

And I know that Chris Reeves song was recorded in 2004 for Encore (Yeah)

Fuck'd you take it off for?

'Cause he died

Man that motherfucker did that bullshit on purpose to ruin the song for us

Man, I never seen a bigger pussy than you

Bitch, look at all the shit the media's puttin' me through (What?)

'Cause of all the fuck shit that you pushed me to do (Me?)

Should've knew when I found you, you were just too good to be true

That's how we end up in these quagmires

You said you had my back, liar

But I helped you get your stacks higher (Yeah)

That's diamond sales like sapphires

Rap buyers, admires pack lines of admirers

Now they say you lack ire

That's why your satire backfires (Yeah)

Flat tires, no longer that guy you were prior to this, yeah

And I scare you 'cause (Why?)

I'm who you used to be (Who?)

The you who didn't crumble under the scrutiny (What?)

When it was you and me (Yeah)

I gave you power to use me as an excuse to be evil (I know)

You created me to say everything you didn't have the balls to say (Yep)

What you were thinking but in a more diabolic way

You fed me pills and a bottle of alcohol a day (Okay)

Made me too strong for you and lost control of me (You're right)

I took over you totally

You were socially awkward 'til you molded me (Yeah)

You was a loner and nobody

'Cause of me, you didn't take shit from nobody

Now look at you (What?)

Now you just a punk (Man), little scaredy cat (Word)

Got you shook like Shakira's ass (Yeah)

To look at your reflection staring back, bitch

It's just a mirror, relax

Man, you're so full of shit, you need MiraLAX

Open your mouth and shit flies out, just lies

You thinkin' you can rip my ass, undo these zipties

You can just undo my feet and keep my hands tied

'Cause like an avalanche, I'd still win by a landside

Oh, you think so, bitch? Yeah, I know so

Okay, your hands and feet, I let 'em both go

Yeah, fuck now, ho, give me that gun, no, don't

Rear naked choke hold, let me go, yo

Here, take it, bozo (Yeah)

Weird bait, you homo (You ready?)

No, don't shoot (Here we go)

Bro, no, no

Now say you're sorry and you didn't mean any of it

I'm sorry, Marshalls a pussy, he's Dre and Jimmy's puppet

Sorry he gives a fuck, but pretends he doesn't

God, you piece of shit, that does it (Uh-oh)

Yeah, bitch, this is for him

Christopher, MGK, Nick, and for Limp Bizkit and them

Midgets and Ben— (Man, please)

'Zino, in addition to him

Will Smith and to Canibus, if you're listening, this is the end (Okay, okay, I'll stop)

So to Jamar and Ja Rule and to all my feuds including ma (What?)

I'm welcoming you to my (No, no)

Last hoorah, I bid you goodbye (Come on, man, don't do this) murder suicide

Killshot, booyaka, cock sucker

Coupe de grace, motherfucker



Oh, what the fuck?

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Yeah?

Paul, your not gonna fucking believe this bro

I had this dream, it was fucking crazy

It was like, the old me came back and the new me

And took over my brain and had me saying all this fucked up shit

About little people and Caitlyn Jenner and

PC Police were chasing me

And fucking Gen Z was tryna kill me

And quadriplegics

And Christopher Reeves

And I was saying all this fucked up shit

And I couldn't stop saying it

And then I wake and it was like I was still dreaming

Fuck you

Wait

Haha"

Know it's all just a test, but I can't pass up this hunger
There's still a hole in my chest and I'm tryna strap it with numbers
All you hoes got your checks, but I'm a queen when I run up
Cross a king with my hunters, shootin' threes in abundance
Rookie Gs, I can thug us, he points to me, shut the fuck up

Annihilation's what we love, steady hittin', gettin' dodged

Just wait 'til we get the guns out

Kwarenta-singko na kalibre o nuwebe, 'kaw na bahala

Sa dinami-rami mong mali, utak mo lang may tama

Sa kitid mo mag-isip, pare, 'la ka man lang nabanat

Naglalim-laliman, ang sarap mong ilublob sa dagat

'Di kailangang magpatunay sa sinuman na nakikinig

'Di masasalag ng sintido o ng iyong bibig

Picture this, I might be a hero to your little kid

Or a villain, either way, I'm the fuckin' head



I'm the head honcho, money comе from my flow

Que hubole blanco, then gеt the bread pronto (Uh-huh)

Yeah, I'm the head honcho, money come from my flow (Yeah)

Que hubole blanco (Uh), then get the bread pronto (Look, I got)



Got loose strips, two grip, that's the shit I'm smooth with

I'm the new kid that these fathers can't fool with

Send my new slips as tighly than how these boots fit

I got that new drip, that drowned titanical cruise ships

Don't you dip and dabble too close

Just watch us from the distance, I don't fuck with all that glucose

You fall and need assistance, I could do the same, but who knows

I'd rather say, ""Good riddance,"" Jack the Ripper rippin' paroles

Annihilate with persistence to try to say something different

But while today, I'm just spittin' to rhyme while makin' a livin'

But mama say that I'm different, she proud of how I do business

I'd kinda resemble Hitman that got away from the killin'



I'm the head honcho, money come from my flow

Que hubole blanco, then get the bread pronto

Yeah, I'm the head honcho, they call me the boss, though

You can call me Marshall, then get the bread pronto (Yo)



You don't relate to me, guess you never been angry or sad (Hm)

Or maybe just have never had to ever face adversity

Take any ass whippings, I basically had

To see some shit that'd make you faint like you're fakin' a jab (Pussy)

Bitch, you wish you had a life like mine (Yeah)

You just fantasize the shit you write, you guys like lying (Yeah)

Everything you ever been through multiplied by nine (What?)

Ain't even half the shit I went through by the time I was five (Like, what?)

Saw my uncle get stabbed, took a knife right in the abs (Yeah)

And all he was tryna do was get my tricycle back, yeah

The one that Boogie, Malcolm and Isaac just jacked

After they jumped me and stomped me (Boom) and hit me twice with a bat (Ugh)

Was five and a half, second time I survived an attack

Two twins, they call themselves the bulldogs (Hrr), white kids and fat

I was too frightened to scrap (Ha), I didn't fight or hit back

And you wonder why is it that? I treat a mic like a gat

Fully loaded, but I pull it, a bullet from out a barrel the size (Brr) of a derringer flies

That's how I would characterize lyrics

But America, I could see the fear in your eyes

You saw my terrible side, the blonde hair and blue eyes

Now, the writing is on the wall like graffiti still

If you're havin' trouble reading, will make it simple, he's Ezekiel

Easy name to remember (Why?)

'Cause his rap name is the same as like ten minutes on stage is for me (Oh), easy mill

Or should I say measly mill? (Haha)

Yeah, 'cause as sure as Ma used to feed me

Sleeping pills to keep me (Yeah), sleepy still, it was creepy

'Cause indeed, she (What?) could've easily Casey Anthony'd me (Yeah)

These rappers, I'm above 'em, but punchin' down ain't beneath me (Nope)

Cold as the wind chill factor, but the fact is I don't know when to chill

But every time I come out, they expect me to fuckin' reinvent the wheel

Rappers get praised for spittin' bars with less than the tenth of skill

Imbecile on the ledge like a Benzo pill on a windowsill

Now cancelled ain't the word for me

You need a term that's probably stronger than dirty laundry (Hell)

This controversy got me in the worst of quandaries

Feel like the Earth's axis, the world's turnin' on me

Like them cops in Akron, Ohio with Jayland Walker

Ain't caught this much flak in a while (Nah) since back as a child (Damn)

And all I did was say like one thing bad then it spiraled

Saw you crackin' a smile (Haha), and relapsed into my old ways

Back into vile (Yup)

Guess there ain't no civilizin' a savage, and I don't (No)

Give a fuck if you hate me worse than these track on Revival (Huh)

Bitch, I'm back like a spinal (Yeah), get it crackin' like chiros

It's the coup de grâce, I'm cooler than removin' claws from a cougar's paws and throwin' it back in the wild (Fuck)

But you tamin' me? Ain't gonna happen, and I'll

Live on planet denial (Ha) for the rest of my life

But you be a stan 'til I die, though (Ha)"

The truth is, I think what scares me the most is not being able to say all the things I wanna say to you when I'm no longer here
So this song is for Hailie, for when that day comes
Where's Hailie? Where's she at?
This ain't Hailie
Who is it?

It's a monster



I've been waiting all night for the sunrise

To take away the dark sky

You're the dad monster and them are the baby monsters and I'm the mom monster

Oh

All it takes is a new day sometimes

To get me in a better state of mind

Give me a kiss, monster, give me a kiss

Love you

I love you



If I could just fall asleep

I'd be lost in a dream

But right now, it's misery

And I just have to remember



That when a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever

The pieces will grow back together

And in time, I'll be fine

The tears are temporary



Yeah, so Hailie Jade, I wrote you this song

To help you cope with life now that I'm gone

How should I start? Just wanna say

Look after Alaina, Stevie, and Uncle Nate

And, sweetie, be strong, I know I was your rock

And I still am, saying goodbye is just not

Ever easy, why you crying? Just stop

Hailie, baby, dry your eye, this is not

Forever



That when a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever

The pieces will grow back together

And in time, I'll be fine

The tears are temporary



Daddy (Ooh)

What? (Ooh)

I used to have this when I was a little kid (Ooh)

Baby, are you okay? (Ooh)



Yeah, and you will get over me and move on

You can play me on repeat on a song

But don't you dare shed a tear, what I tell you?

""Straighten up, little soldier,"" them times when I held you

Jade, it'll be okay, baby, I'm here, Hay

I'm watchin' you right now, baby girl, I vow

I will protect you, tour guardian angel

As hard as this may feel, as parting is painful

And, darling, the rain will, drive you insane still

You will remain strong, Hailie, just hang on

It won't be too long, I need you to move on

And remember, it will get better

'Cause times heals and when a



When a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever

The pieces will grow back together

And in time, I'll be fine

The tears are temporary

The bad days will start to get better

And we'll be laughin' together

And tonight, when I cry

The tears are temporary



I know this big girl (Ooh)

And she's really pretty (Ooh)

You know what her name is?

Hailie (Ooh)

Hailie, how did you know? (Ooh)



Yeah, and if there's days when you wanna lock yourself in your room and cry

Just think about how when you were little, how you and I

Back and forth to the studio, we used to drive

You strapped in the backseat 'cause you were my

Little sidekick, yeah, sweetie, I know this hurts

Bean, I'm wishing your pain away

Remember this, Hailie Jade

There's gonna be rainy days

I promise you'll get through 'em and make it regardless

Fuck it, Jade, I'll be honest

I knew that you was gonna take this the hardest

Sweetie, get up, I know that is is breaking your heart, it's

The hardest thing I ever wrote (Daddy)

Hailie, sweetheart, it's okay for you to let me go

Baby, I promise you that when a—



When a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever

The bad days will start to get better

And we'll be laughin' together

The tears are temporary



What's your favorite song? (Ooh)

My favorite song right now (Ooh)

Mine and your favorite song, but

I like this part

That's your favorite part, dad? (Ooh)



You're taping me, bitch

I got you on tape cussin'

Can you hear?

Yeah

No, bitch

No what?

No, I said, I said no, bitch

Okay, no cussin'"

I'ma just lay back on this one
Let me apologize in advance (I like that)
Fuck it, forgive me (Alright)
Fuck it, I don't mean to sound (You ready?) arrogant (Fuck it, yeah) but



Yeah, my head up in the sky again

But even that, my stacks are higher than

Money pile like Tony Stark's, that's how much I earn, man

Girl, my head is small, I feel incredible as the Hulk

Meaning I'm trying to smash

So come get in line like Santa and climb up inside my lap

While I devise a plan

Won't be talkin' about Purell when Santa ties your hands

And I am an

Industrial-strength heightened brand

Frying pan

Rap is something that I've just had the skillet for some timing, am

An artist who can draw a crowd like a diagram

Like drawing breath from your diaphragm

I've achieved every aspiration that I have had

Got a diamond plaque or two or three or four

But that don't change my attitude, I got a bad one



I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one



Yeah

One minute, you're here, next minute, you're gone, don't sit there and scoff

Lil' bitch, you can knock the shit about me being immature off

It isn't my fault, the liquor is often twisting my thoughts

You said you're looking for miniature golf

I thought you said looking for men to jerk off

Your mouth is a hole (What?), that means my dick is engulfed

Sick as a dog with croup cough (What?)

Biggie is gone and Tupac (Yeah)

And I'm still alive and you not the woo, dog

So who died and made you God?

Anything can set my mood off, attitude, I've always had one

My temper is like the bitch I just scooped up, I got a bad one



I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one



Yeah, this whole sub-genre with all these corny white rappers, I'm not a fan of it

It ain't my fault, but like sock puppets, I had a hand in it

This thousand bucks in my hand is just like what Candace did

When she turned her back on her own race 'cause I have abandoned it

One of the greatest who did it, look what I came up through

You never made it to the level that I made it to

So similar to a dinner table, I ate at you (Sorry)

Haters, I made a few

But like when Three Stacks just plays the flute

I ain't got shit to say to you (Nah)

And me offending you's nothing new (Nah)

Fuck it, it's what I love to do

This is subterfuge, just to screw with you

And yeah, this much is true

This sounds like something that Puff would do

At the party with Aaron Hall 'cause I just love to fuck with you (Woah)

A line of blush, foundation kit

'Cause it's you I make upset

Brain is dead, space cadet

Like when Ye forgets to take his meds

So when they get mad or angry at

A statement that I may have said

I just say, ""Man, I didn't say that shit, Shady did""

'Cause all I do is write the rhymes and then wait for that beat to play, spit 'em

Trigger finger, make like a green beret like he would get a submachine to spray with 'em

I should go back to those sleeping aids

Because I'm so stuck in my evil ways

Then I'm fucked either way

The people still seem to think they want the old me 'til they get him

Got 'em up in arms like monkey bars

The fucking bomb with the puffy on

I'm blowing up for Kid Cudi's car

In front of his house where all his buddies are

Just another day at the office, but it seems like Marsh's fucking job is done

Mission accomplished, people off this stunt

And pissed a billion people off at once (Yeah)

But I gotta keep going Tyson on Kelly (What?)

I bodied him twice and already

That little motherfucker's back throwing subs (Like what?) like a food fight at the deli

And that is why E got the attitude he got like Liza Minnelli

My male ego

Is the size of the belly on Jelly Roll

And bitch, I got a bad one



I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one

She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum

You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond

I just Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one"

Somebody save me

Me from myself

Another pill as I start to spiral

Message to my daughters

I don't even deserve the father title

Hailie, I'm so sorry

I know I wasn't there for your first guitar recital

Didn't walk you down the aisle

Missed the birth of your first child

Your first podcast, lookin' down, sweetie

I'm so proud of how you turned out

Sorry that I chose drugs and put 'em above you

Sorry that I didn't love you enough to

Give 'em up, how the fuck do

I not love you more than a pill?

Lookin' up to the ceilin' from this floor wonder will



Somebody save me

Me from myself

I've spent so long livin' in hell

They say my lifestyle is bad for my health

It's the only thing that seems to help



Alaina, sorry that you had to hear me fall in the bathroom

Sorry that I missed your gradu—, wait, Nate, I should just congratulate you

On bein' a dad to Carter and Liam, look at you

Little bro, sorry I left you

Sorry that I'll never get to

Hold or hug my little nephews

Stevie, I'm sorry, I missed you

Grow up and I didn't get to

Be the dad I wanted to be to you

Things I wanted to see you do

This is my song from me to you

Sorry I gave up, but I'm just so defeated

God, what the fuck do you want me to do?

I've been starin' at that video of Hailie

Almost daily of her playin' a guitar

In hopes maybe that'll give me the power to fight

But the addict in me's a coward, he told me that I can't do it

Had a second chance, blew it

It's like I'm stuck inside an alternate reality, but I know (What?)

I'll turn it around and be able to

Walk her and Lainie one day

To the altar as proud as can be

Right now, I'm just weak

As I fall further down in this deep hole

And farther in the ground that I sink

As they lower me in my coffin, I feel the tears all fallin' down on my cheek



I'm a lost cause

Baby, don't waste your time on me

I'm so damaged beyond repair

Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams

I'm a lost cause

Baby, don't waste your time on me

I'm so damaged beyond repair

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search

Maybe I needed to grow up a little first

Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt

But I am coming for closure

Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for

The way that you turned your back on me

Just when I may have needed you most

Oh, you thought it was over

You can just close the chapter

And go about your life, like it was nothing

You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine

I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha

'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered

Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice

Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: ""let it go, fuck this""

Heart is saying: ""I will once I bury this bitch alive

Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset""



[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]

I flee the scene like it was my last ride

You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time

You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good

And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy



[Verse 2]

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch

To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit

Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?

Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch

Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit

Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!

You left our family in shambles

You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed

Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten

And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long

That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya

You're wrong and that shit was rotten

And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go!

Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?

Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to

Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing

Letters, you don't respond to 'em

Fuck it, I'm coming to see you

And gee who better to talk to than you?

The cause of my problems

My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you

Poof, then I'm gone



[Hook]

I flee the scene like it was my last ride

[Verse 3]

I've been driving around your side of this town

Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now

Finally I found your new address, park in your drive

Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life

And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva

My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house

See, it's sad it came to this point

Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya

But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology

Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek

So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window

Like I reach my full potential, I peaked

Continue to peep, still bent low

Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo

Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch

Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this

You don't plan for intruders before hand?

Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?

Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung

Like you picked up an axe up and then swung

Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk

By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?

Now who's a faggot, you punk?

And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck

It's just me, you and the music now, Slim

I hope you hear it we are in a car right now

Wait, here comes my favorite lyric

I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die

And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP

Just to try to get people to buy

How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun

Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done

Eminem killed by M&M

Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials

I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it

Since you love you're city so much

I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here

Two more exits, town is quite near

I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear

That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea

As cops appear in my driver side mirror

(Oh, God, Police!! Ah!)

Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least

New plan Stan

Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car

Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you

Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can swim good!

Now say you hate homos again!



[Verse 4]

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend

I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in

I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen

Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin

No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in

When they say all of this is approaching its end

But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again

Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds

Toilets clogged, Yeah cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up

But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas

After the track is demolished

I am your lack of a conscience

I'm the ringing in your ears

I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils

Eating your vocal chords after your concerts

I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged

Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow

I'm the bullies you hate, that you became

With every faggot you slaughtered

Coming back on you every woman you insult

That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters

I represent everything, you take for granted

Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade

And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone

Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name

Cameras are off

Sad, but it happens to all of them

I'm the hindsight to say, I told you so!

Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow

I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow

If you don't stop after they call you the

Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits

When it's time to walk away

I'm every guilt trip

The baggage you had

But as you gather up all your possessions

If there's anything you have left to say

Unless it makes an impact don't bother

So before you rest your case

Better make sure you're packing a wallop

So one last time, I'm back

Before it fades into black and it's all over

Behold the final chapter in the saga

Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle

Twice the magic that started it all

Tragic portrait of an artist tortured

Trapped in his own drawings

Tap into thoughts

Blacker and darker than anything imaginable

Here goes a wild stab in the dark

As we pick up the last Mathers left off"

(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco

It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun

Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum

About to explode all over the canvas

Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm



(Your music usually has them)

(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't

Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)



A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining

But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and

Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting

(puke) Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk

Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog

Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on, (oh..)

Its on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small

(It says) Ever since I drove a 79 Lincoln with white walls

Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to DIE HARD

So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card

Hip hop ain't dying on my watch



But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams

Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, I don't care, don't have two shits to give

Let me take you by the hand, to promise land, and threaten everyone

Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

Nah, (Whats your name?) Marshall

(Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder

(Is he rich like me?) Haha

(Has he taken, any time, to show to show you what you need to live?)



[Verse 2]

No, If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad

I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad

Uh, The epitome and the prime example of what happens

When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and

Makes you want to get up and start dancing

Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, To be rapping

Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank

Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, I'm in the style department

With a pile in my car, ripping the isle apart

With great power comes absolutely no responsiblity, for content

Completely, despondent, and conde-scen-ding

The king of nonsense and contro-versy in on, a

Beat killing spree, your honor, I must, plea

Guil-ty, cause I sparked a, Revolution

Rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap

To take it to the next level, boost it

But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it

(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?

Cuz I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns

That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?

But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper

Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch

Cause its the



[Hook]

It's the time of the season, when hate runs high

And this time, give it to you easy, when I take back what's mine

With pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan

My job here isn't done, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing



(What's your name?) Shady

(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder

(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha

(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)



[Verse 3]

So yeah dad let's walk

Let's have us a father and son talk

But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block

Without me knocking your block off

This is all your fault

Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas

I appeal to all those walks of like

Whoever had strife

Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like

Cause I related to the struggles of [young] America

When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles

Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again

It's a stare ruckle, I chuckle

Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles

Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckleheads

The sound of my hustle says don't knock

The doors broken, it won't lock

It might just fly open, get cold cocked

You critics come pay me a visit

Misery loves company, please stay a minute

Kryptonite to a hypocrite

Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it

Too busy getting stoned in your glass house

To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out

Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers

So spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out

A completely brain dead Rainman

Doing a bankhead in a restraint chair

So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare

Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than

All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef

Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah

Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look

For a fucking reason for it that ain't there

But I still am a CRIMINAL

Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals

The last Mathers LP that went diamond

This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald

When will the madness end, how can it when

There's no method the pad and pen

The only message that I have to sing is:

Dad, I'm back at it again

And this thought just popped in my head and I thought

Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)

I would feel so (so) much (much) better x3

Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink

Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think

Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go

Cause I told em I'm only driving drunk cause that bitch drove me to drink

I'm back on my fuck ho's

But a whole new hatred for blondes, but bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby come on

Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement

And I am channeling my anger through every single station it's on

Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say he-art cause you ripped it in two pa-arts

And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you are?

Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off

And pick myself up off the carpet

But I'll never say the L-word again

Cuz you told me, you love me, forever

So bad in my fucking life but fuck it there's other fish in the sea



And I'mma have a whale of a time

Being a single sailor for the night

Bitch on a scale of 1 to 10, shit

I must be the holy grailer

Catch this ho I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name (great)

I might hit the club on a chica's tail, uh

Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back and hammer the nailer

These bitches tryna get atached with the failer

And latch him to the tail of my bumper to scratch them with the back of my trailer

Like I'm itchin' to get hitched

Yeah I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit

I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch

Bitch you complain when you listen to this

But you still throw yourself at me

That's what I call pitchin' a bitch

That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight

Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul

But my dick's on strike so all that love shit is null and void

Bitch I'm a droid, I void cupid stupid wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed

Oi oi oi man oh man you boy boy boys

Getting sick at these girls girls girls

Oink oink oink you fucking pigs

All you good boys doink doink doink

This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

[Verse 1]

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared

I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there

From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends

It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, f*ck an acronym

Cut the f*cking act like you're happy, I'm f*cking back again

With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?

It ain't over 'til I say it's over  enough when I say enough

Throw me to the wolves and close the gate up

I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves

When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it

Weight is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie

Hold them b*tches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff

Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos

I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt



[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]

This is survival of the fittest

This is do or die

This is the winner takes it all

So take it all



[Verse 2]

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish

I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post

And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough

To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?

They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath

I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust

Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust

So floor's open if you'd like to discuss

Top 5 in this mothaf*cka and if I don't make the cut

What, like I give a f*ck, I'ma light this b*tch up like I'm driving a truck

To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it

Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up

And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut

And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook

Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself

With a f*cking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!

Cause I just sh*tted on the mic, and I like getting cut

I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut

Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win

Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait

Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting

Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut

It's survival of what?



[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]

This is survival of the fittest

This is do or die

This is the winner takes it all

So take it all



[Verse 3]

So get your ideas, stack your ammo

But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle

This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and sh*t

Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this

Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick

I don't do this music sh*t, I lose my sh*t

Ain't got sh*t to lose, it's the moment of truth

It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit

But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do

Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!

So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades

So you'd better trade your f*cking mics in for some tool-box-es

Cause you'll never take my pride from me

It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drivers

But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve

Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed

And if you don't like me then f*ck you!

Self es-teem must be f*cking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me

My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me

I can see why the f*ck I disgust you

I must be a-llergic to failure cause every time I come close to it

I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve!

I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling

Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?

What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in

Cause I don't belong in this world

That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often

Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad

So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward

And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist

Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems

Thinking he can try and solve 'em, I'm outside chalking up

Drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive talking to myself

Either that or inside hiding off in

The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed

I'm crying and sobbing, I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking

Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker 'cause he said I eyeballed him

That are fought inside your world, please have faith in my words cause

I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling

Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?

Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling

Cause I obsess on everything and my mind it's small shit

Bothers me but now my father, he said Sayonara,then split

But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as

There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me

Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking

I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment

Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I

Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it

Headphones on straight ahead and kids try to start shit,

But if this all there is for me Life offers

Why bother even try and put up a fight It's nonsense

But I think a lightbulb just lit up in my conscience

What about those rhymes I've been jottin'

They are kinda giving me confidence

Instead of tryina escape through my comics,

Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx

To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that

Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him

Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch

Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on

I could be iconic, and my conquest is

Word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest

I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is falling

Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome

Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work

Words like this and connect lines like crosswords

And use my enemy's words as strength

To try and draw from, and get inspired off em

Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit

By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit

Now you shut up bitch I am talking

Thought I was full of horseshit and now

You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking

Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins

Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense

So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins

It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins

Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of brian baldingers

You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical

With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus

You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can

Suck a dick The day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass

And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage

The most high exalting and I ain't halting

Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes

The best part about me is I am not you

I am me I'm a fire marshall and this is my



[Hook]

This is my legacy (Legacy)

This is my legacy (Legacy)

There's no guarantee, it's not up to me you can only see

This is my legacy (Legacy)"

Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling
Don't think I ever stopped to think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast, it was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember

Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling

Like I am always under attack man

I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling

Women dish him but really thinking

If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him

Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite

When I'm ripping shit, but since when did this many

People ever give a shit what I had to say

It's just my opinion

If it contradicts how I'm living

Put a dick in your rear end, your rear end that's why

Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it

For drawing more attention toward it

Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude

Thought I was that important

But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect

And battle for it, mad awards, (?) annoyed

Attaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out

Good luck trying to convince a blonde

That's like telling Gwen Stefan' that she sold out

Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt

In anyone's mind one day I'd (?) go down

In history think they know now (?)

Because everybody knows



[Chorus - Skylar Grey]

Everybody knows that're just an asshole

Everywhere that you go

People wanna go home

Everyone knows

Everybody knows

So don't pretend to be nice

There's no place you can hide

You are just an asshole

Everyone knows

Everyone knows



[Verse 2]

Thanks for the support, asshole *scratch* thanks for the support, asshole

Quit acting salty

I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth

When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out

Thought I was history

But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey

Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth

Lay'em off it

But what the fuck is all this thrash talking about

The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me

You knock me down, I went down from the counter

I fell but the fans caught me, and now

You're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me

To take my belt, word to Pacquiao

Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about

Gotta go in that ring and knock them out

Or you better not come out

It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare

So what if the insults are revolting

Even Helen Keller knows life stinks

You think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled

But you should give little shit what I think

This whole world is a mess

Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock

Just to go out watch Batman

Who needs to test(?) the testicles, not that man

Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage

Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model

Before they put bathsalts and all those water bottles in Colorado

So get lost, Waldo

My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping

A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole

With a pack torn of paper

But I'm not taking no crap, ho

Here I go down the back pole

And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go

Trying to dip through the back door retreating cause everybody knows



[Chorus - Skylar Grey]

Everybody knows that're just an asshole

Everywhere that you go

People wanna go home

Everyone knows

Everybody knows

So don't pretend to be nice

There's no place you can hide

You are just an asshole

Everyone knows

Everyone knows



[Verse 3]

Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth

I smack the girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull

Thinkin we have some magnetic pull

Screamin ICP in this bitch, how do fucking magnets work?

Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable

Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical

I'm making up words you can understandable, It's tragical

Thinkin some magical shit's gonna happen? That ain't practical

You crackin a joke, it's laughable, cause me and love's like a bad combination

I keep them feelings locked in a vault

So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable

My heart is truly guarded, full body armor

Bitch you just need a helmet because if you think you're special, you're retarded. Thinkin you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina, you're a train wreck, I got a one track mind

Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er

Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor

Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog, cause you're on my ass

But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent

With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin

Only women that I love are my daughters

And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther

So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line

It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up

So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time

It ain't never gonna stop. A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime, so even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive

Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, so now my cup is runneth over

And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster

I'm goin back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can't not been? rude off? so fear not my dear, and dry up your teardrops I'm here

White America's mirror, so I feel awkward and weird, you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too. You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows."""

this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad 
cause my rhymes on the ra-hag

Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it

Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets

Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it

But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it



So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment

'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick

Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!

The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren

And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch

Been public enemy 

since you thought PE was gym, bitch



Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk),

All night long...

Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk),

All night long....



We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down

So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.

So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go

Say fck it before we kick the bucket

Life's too short to not go for broke

So everybody, everybody, shake your body



Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?

Khakis pressed, Nike shoes just being fresh laced

So I guess it ain't

Dead after shave of cologne that made him just faint

Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint

So if love is a chess game, check mate



But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang -- bang, bang

Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing

So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang

P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow

Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow

Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel

Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how

At least I know that I don't know

Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid

Hope so, now ho...



Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), 

all night long

Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), 

all night long



We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down

So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.

So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go

Say fck it before we kick the bucket

Life's too short to not go for broke

So everybody, everybody, get your vials



They say that love is powerful as 

cough syrup and Styrofoam

All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo

With the ugly Kardashian

Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low

Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past

But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow

And girl I ain't got no money to borrow

But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!

Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know

Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur's Cargo's

Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man

You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman

Unless you're a swallow

Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl

This is your jam, unless you got toe jam



Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), 

all night long

Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), 

all night long



We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down

So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.

So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go

Say fck it before we kick the bucket

So everybody, everybody, get your vials"

But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it
Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what

If that means what I think it means

We're in trouble, big trouble

And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances

You are just what the doc ordered



I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes

I got a laptop in my back pocket

My pen'll go off when I half-cock it

Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a livin' and a killin' off it

Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office

With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his, nutsack

I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and as indecent as all hell

Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop

You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap

Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'

Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack

And at the exact same time

I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that

I'll still be able to break a mothafuckin' table

Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic

I was signed to Aftermath after the fact

How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs

Feel my wrath of attack

Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad

It's actually disastrously bad for the wack

While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece



Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret

To rap immortality like I have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's

Simply rage and youthful exuberance

Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

Hit the Earth like an asteroid

Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew)

MC's get taken to school with this music

Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""

Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up

Blow up and be in a position

To meet RunD.M.C., and induct them

Into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames

Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

On the wall of (shame)

You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames

Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

Little gay-looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy

You're witnessing a massacre, like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy

""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"", that's all they say, looking boy

You get a thumbs up, pat on the back

And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, looking boy

Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy?

I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, looking boy

I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit

Get outta my face, looking boy!

Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable

Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy



Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR

Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God

Kneel before General Zod

This planet's Krypton; no, Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent

Let off then I'm reloadin'

Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'

And I should not be woken; I'm the walking dead

But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin'

But I got your mom deep throatin'

I'm out my Ramen Noodle

We have nothing in common, poodle

I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm

And pay homage, pupil

It's me, my honesty's brutal

But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while

So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes

To maybe try to help get some people through tough times

But I gotta keep a few punchlines

Just in case, cause even you unsigned

Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime

I know there was a time where once I

Was king of the underground

But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

Appeal with the skin color of mine

You get too big and here they come tryin' to

Censor you, like that one line

I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Mathers LP 1 when I tried to say

""I'll take seven kids from Columbine

Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9""

See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal, coming through the portal

You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though

And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for

You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking Cornrows

You write normal? Fuck being normal

And I just bought a new raygun from the future

Just to come and shoot ya

Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad

Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad

Singing to a man while they played piano

Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel

So Ray J went straight to the radio station

The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""

Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)

Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma

You assuming I'm a human

What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman

Innovative and I'm made of rubber

So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me

And it'll glue to you and

I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating

Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting

For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating

Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated

I make elevating music, you make elevator music

""Oh, he's too mainstream""

Well, that's what they do when they get jealous

They confuse it; ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop""

Cause I found a hella way to fuse it

With rock, shock rap with Doc

Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it

""I don't know how to make songs like that

I don't know what words to use""

Let me know when it occurs to you

While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you

It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you

How many verses I gotta murder to

Prove that if you were half as nice

Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?

Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie

But look at the accolades these skills brung me

Full of myself, but still hungry

I bully myself, cause I make me do what I put my mind to

And I'm a million leagues above you

Ill when I speak in tongues

But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!

I'm drunk, so Satan, take the fucking wheel!

I'm asleep in the front seat

Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""

But in my head there's something

I can feel tugging and struggling

Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate

But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have

Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic

To the situation and understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons

Make lemonade then!

But if I can't batter the women

How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?

Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake

If you think I need to be overseas

And take a vacation to trip a broad

And make her fall on her face and

Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not

Why be a king when you can be a God?"

Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer

If science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use

Society will reap a great benefit



[Verse 1]

I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets

Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of tourettes

Fuck, fuck, fuck! Can't take the stress

I make a mess as the day progresses

Angry and take it out on the neighbours hedges

Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches

With these hedge trimming scisors with razor edges

Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this

Mess and make the best of this situation, I guess

Cuz I feel like a little bitch's, predicaments, despicable

I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous

I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy

This kid just took my stick of liquorice

And threw my sticker books in a picker bush

I wanna kick his toosh, but I was six and shook

This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook

He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book, now there's using your head



[Hook]

Mama always said 'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)

Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous

And I'mma be a pain in the anus

(Mama could be wrong)

I'mma use my head as a weapon

Find a way to escape this insaneness

Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

Guess it pays to be brainless



[Verse 2]

Fast forward some years later

A teenager, this is a fun, sweet

I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete

It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished

They've stomped me into the mud [gee] for what reason, you stomped me

But how do you get the shit beat out of you, be down and be upbeat

When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life

Chance To make it or succeed

Cuz you're doomed from the start

It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street

But if I had just kept my head up my ass

I could accomplish any task

Practicing trash talking in a trance

Locked in my room yeah But I got some plans mama

These damn rhymes are falling

Out of my pants pocket I can't stop it

And I'm starting to blend in more, school this shit helps for sure

I'm getting more self assured than I've ever been before

Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that

Threw my first punch, end of story

Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void

Been using it more as a bin for storage

Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword

Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore

Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain

Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head

Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't

Cause I'd probably be dahmer cause mama always said



[Hook]

Mama always said 'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)

Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous

And I'mma be a pain in the anus

(Mama could be wrong)

I'mma use my head as a weapon

Find a way to escape this insaneness

Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

Guess it pays to be brainless



[Bridge]

Now my mum goes womp womp womp

Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb

I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped

But somehow, I came out on top



[Verse 3]

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo

I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold

Now everywhere I go, they scream out 'Go'

I'm bout to clean house, yo

I'm Lysol, now I'm just household

Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out

Middle America, hear them yell out

[until] they were so scared, and those kids

Just about, belted out

Whatever spout that it fell out

Of my smart alleck mouth, it was so weird

Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it

Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as

Motherfuckin' difficult, ch'yea, til then

Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards

It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers

Til emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius

Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah

You motherfuckin' Insert insult here

Who the fuck would've thunk that one little lone MC would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it

And boy they did flock

Can't believe this little hick locked

This hip hop shit in his pocket and still the shit got

That white trash traffic and gridlock

Shit happened like a six blocks from a Kid Rock

Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-tober

And got forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog

Cause I turn into the unabomber mama always said



[Hook]

Mama always said 'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)

Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous

And I'mma be a pain in the anus

You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
And I believe I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave

Snatch the keys from your hand

I would squeeze and you'd laugh

And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me

And you must hate me

Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?

And you've had enough of me

I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge



[Hook]

But you won't break me

You'll just make me stronger than I was

Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you

And if I stumble, I won't crumble

I'll get back up and uhhh

And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you

Cause I'm stronger than I was



[Verse 2]

A beautiful face is all that you had

Cause on the inside you're ugly, man

But you're all that I love

Aggressed, you can't leave

Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please

And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees

And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave

Cause you left and you took everything I had left

And left nothing, nothing for me

So please don't wake me from this dream, baby

We're still together in my head

And you're still in love with me

Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you

Cause I'm stronger than I was



[Verse 3]

You walked out, I almost died

It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized

Felt like I was in for a long bus ride

I'd rather die than you not be by my side

Can't count how many times I vomited, cried

Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh

We were Bonnie and Clyde

No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I

Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie

It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?

Cause if you could've took my life you would've

It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the

Other side of my pack and stuck a spike, too, should've

Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time

No one could hurt me like you could've

Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?

Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer

Cause this morning I finally stood up

Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the

First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams

And a life we could've had and we could've been

But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in

Pulling myself out of the dumps once again

I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit

I'mma be late for the pity party

But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again

Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends

I'm done being your punching bag

It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary

Two years, but you left on the first of May

I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say

But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay

And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was

But I hate you cause you drained me

I gave you all, you gave me none

But if you blame me, you're crazy

And after all that's said and done

I'm still angry, yeah, I maybe

I may never trust someone



[Hook]

But you won't break me

You'll just make me stronger than I was

Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you

And if I stumble, I won't crumble

I'll get back up and uhhh

And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you

Cause I'm stronger than I was"

That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)





I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek

Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey

Wanted to receive attention for my music

Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me

Been wanting my cake, And eat it too

And wanting it both ways

Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated

When I blew seep and it was confusing

Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam

Hit the lottery (oh wee)

With what I gave up to get was bittersweet

It was like winning a huge meet

Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink

I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep

Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith

But I'm actually weirder than you think

Cause I'm...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh

Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh





Now I ain't much of a poet

But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment

And don't squander it

Cause you never know when it could all be over

Tomorrow so I keep conjuring

Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from

(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way you're wandering?)

I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster

And save me from myself and all this conflict

Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it

My OCD is conking me in the head

Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking

I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying

Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh

Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh





Call me crazy, but I had this vision

One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian

But, until then,

drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at

Emcees, blood get spilled and I

Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track

Give every kid who got played at

Pumped the feeling

and shit to say back

To the kids who played 'em

I ain't here to save the fucking children

But if one kid out of a hundred million

Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great

It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back

In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that

Straw in the gold chump I will spend

Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack

Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts

I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that

It's nothing, I'm still friends with the...

I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr.Brightside, glass is half full
But my tank is half empty, gasket just blew

[Verse 1]

This always happens, 30 minutes from home

Gotta lay a log cabin and only option I have is McDonald's bathroom

In a public stall dropping a football

So every time someone walks in the john I get Madden

''Shady, what up?''- What? Come on, man, I'm crapping

And you're asking me for my got damn autograph on a napkin?

Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue

Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then

''Thanks, dawg, name's Todd, a big fan''

I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and

Told him ''Todd, you're the shit'' when does all of this crap end?

Can't park my ass without causing an accident

Puff my gas, cut my grass, can't take out the fucking trash

Without someone passing through my sub harassing

I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math

I'd rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash

But the antacid is my stomach gas

I mix my corn with my fucking mash

Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass

Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upperclass

Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper

Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass

Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?

B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass



[Hook]

Maybe that's why I feel so strange

Got it all, but I still won't change

Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit

It's the motivation that keeps me going

This is the inspiration I need

I can never turn my back on a city that made me

(Life's been good to me so far)



[Verse 2]

They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that

Don't know what the fuck I would doing if it weren't rap

Probably be a giant turd-sack

But I blew, never turned back

Turned 40 and still sag

Teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack

Fuck you gonna say to me?

I leave on my own terms, asshole, I'm going berzerk

My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has

I get to meet famous people, look at her, dag

Her nylons ran, her skirt snag

And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag

Fucking my Hanes shirt tag

You're Danica Patrick (yeah) work, skag

We'd be the perfect match

Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag

My apologies, no disrespect to technology

But what the heck is all of these buttons?

You expect me to sit here and learn that?

Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?

Be an expert at computers?

I'd rather be an encyclopedia Britannica, hell with a Playstation

I'm still on my first manual from Zelda

Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the

Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread

Make a sandwich with welch's and belch

They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but

I think there's more white trash from the trailer

Jed Clampett, Redd Sanford welfare mentality helps to

Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I

Managed to dwell within these parameters

Still cramming the shelves full of hamburger helper

I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt to

Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter

With all these pet peeves

God dammit to hell, I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones

I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I can yell, the

Other day someone got little elaborate and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox

Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings

I think my karma is catching up with me

[Bridge]

Got friends on facebook, all over the world

Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good

So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque

I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked



[Verse 3]

I'm trying to be lowkey, hopefully nobody notices me

In produce hunched over, giant nosebleed

Over stop as I mosey over to the frozen aisle

By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me

Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova

Show's over, I'm hiding in Kroeger buying groceries

He just had front row seats, told me to sign this poster

Then insults me ""wow, up close didn't know you had crow's feet""

I'm at a crossroad lost till shopping at Costco

Sloppy Joe's, buck waffles

Got caught picking my nose, ah

Look over see these two hot hoes

Finger still up in one of my nostrils

Right next to 'em stuck at the light

This fucking shit is taking forever to change

I'm stuck, these bitches are loving it rubbing it in

Chuckling, couldn't do nothing, play it off

''What you bumping? Trunk Muzik? Yelawolf's better'', fucking bitch

They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it

The pressure, they want me to follow up with another one after Recovery

Was so highly coveted, but what good is a fucking recovery if I fumble it?

Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip

Hopping on shrubbery on you sons of bitches

Wrong subdivison to fuck with, bitch

Quit snapping fucking pictures of my kids

I love my titty, but you push me to my limit, what a pity

The shit I complain about

It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out

Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'd never get it out

Bitch, I got an elevator in my house

Ants and a mouse, I'm living the dream

Somethin's burnin', I can't figure out what
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded, must just be the powder from the power of love
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone

Is that my soon to be spouse's moan

And the further I walked allowed her

I paused for a minute to make something, that's what I heard

Cuz after all this is her place

So I gave her the benefit of the doubt

Think I might be about Busta Busta

The thought's so scary, yo that it hurts, brace

Hope it ain't, there we go, yo

Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario, though, in the first place

But you confirmed my low end theory, though

Should've known when I made it all the way to third base

And that was only the first date, coulda made it to home plate

But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first

No, you don't, under, stand, I, don't, do this for

Anyone, ever, Yeah that ain't what they all say

I'll say it, you can suck a softball through a straw, used to be my fiance

'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye

Lebron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e

Polow Tha Don, Drake, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame

Guess I'm gettin my goddamn Jigga on

Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'

But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray

But I'll probably always keep on playin' the game of



Love, love, love, love

L-l, l-l-l-love



[Hook - Kendrick Lamar]

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more

She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more

I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door

She screamed she loves me like she never did before

[And I told her go where you want

And go do what you want to do. I don't care]x2



[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]

I told that bitch

I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick

Suckin' dick in your momma's tub 'til your granny walked in

Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned

Like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter

You beat the case and I called you

""Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone

And Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those

Expensive heels, you little fuckin' ferris wheel

Fuckin' spendin' on me, fuck you think we gon' get married still?

Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale

Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel

Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period

Now have a blessed day""

Bitch you serious? I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious

Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me up, a Caesarean

You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious

I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman

After the dillinger hit'em diligently and killin' him

His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem

That's analogy and metaphor for yah

I should win a medal for all the ways I adore yah

This is me talkin' poetry, yeah I got some home trainin'

That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was famous

As Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool

Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle, singin'

I hope she's good enough, meanwhile you're chasin' her

Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her

Pity the fool that pity the fool in me, I'mma live with the game of

And go do what you want to do. I don't care]x2



[Verse 3: Eminem]

So needless to say I'm feeling betrayed

Snatched my housekey off my keychain

She jumped off, Wee-Bey from The Wire, escape

Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater

Here goes that broken record, cliche, it's all my fault anyway

She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break

Treats my face like seratos, she cuts and scratches like a DJ

Each day is an instant replay

They sayin' we display cinethematic abatic behavior

Back together but forgot today was her b-day, cut me off on the freeway

Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes

Then I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait

Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline, stepped on them fuckers 8 times

Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up

But them other F-U-C-K's all would of hit the off ramp

So I coast into a gosh damned aww hit a fuckin' tree

Now here she comes at full speed, she's racin' at me

Okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?

Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she screamin'

I body slam her onto the cement, until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole

Bury this stink ho in it, then payed to have the street re-paved

Fuck, woke up in a dream state in a cold sweat

Like I got hit with a freeze ray durin' a heat wave

Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin' next to me in bed

Directly aimin' a gat at my head

Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab

I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy

Every girl I've ever had either says I got to much baggage

Or I'm just too dramatic

Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic

I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!

Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex

I actually set off a chain reaction, a tragic event

I said ""hit the road"" and after she left

I sent that bitch a text

I said ""be careful driving, don't read this and have a accident""

She glanced to look at it and write, too bad

Thought we had a connect

No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case

Than a model covered in L'Oreal and mace, who fell from grace

Eleven stories for story telling but the whore was yelling ""rape""

So the vocal cords were swelling

And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spelling's face

Still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes

To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace

Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date, don't be late

Well the sentiments great, but wait then there's been a mistake

You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate

I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of

Wait dinner at eight

I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of

And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far



I went in headfirst

Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse

My mom probably got it the worst

The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are

Did I take it too far?

Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs

But regardless I don't hate you cause ma!

You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom

Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam

Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb

Equivalent to Chemical warfare

And forever we can drag this on and on

But, agree to disagree

That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me

You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve

(little prick just leave) ma, let me grab my fucking coat

Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats?

Especially when dad, he fucked us both

We're in the same fucking boat

You'd think that it'd make us close (nope)

Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine

A car full of belongings

Still got a ways to go, back

To grandma's

House it's straight up the road

And I was the man of the house, the oldest

So my shoulders carried the weight

Of the load

Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and

That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable

And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far



Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though

Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth

But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry

Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause

Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes

That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio

And I think of Nathan being placed in a home

And all the medicine you fed us

And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but

Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow

And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though

But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo

All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both

Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours

But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause

One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was

Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address

But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus

Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas

Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's

If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them

And although one has met their grandma

Once you pulled up in our drive one nights

As we were leaving to get some hamburgers

Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you

And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me

As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and

I saw your headlights as I looked back

And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad

So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet

I guess I had to get this off my chest

I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead

The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing

So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message

That I'll always love you from afar, cause you're my mama...



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far



I want a new life, one without a cause

So I'm coming home tonight, well, no matter what the cost

And if the plane goes down, and if the crew can't wake me up

Just know that I was alright, and I was not afraid to die

Even if there's songs to sing, my children will carry me

Just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die

Because I put my faith in my new girl, so I never say goodbye cruel world

Just know that I'm alright, I am not afraid to die 



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life"

Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think.. I think the lines are starting to get blurry
[Verse 1]
I'm in a strange place

I feel like Mase when he gave up the game for his faith

I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints

Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space

Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face

I need a change of pace cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous

There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst

I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em

Cause that's where most of my anger is based

Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints

I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks

Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's

I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack

I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack

I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is

I'm strapped for battles, suck a duck, crawl out the back, bar fight

Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air

And bottles breaking, mirrors also

And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full

You done called every woman a slut, but you forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin!)

Oh my bad, slut

And next time I show up in court I'll be naked and square a lawsuit

Judge be like ""that's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?

Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you

And jmp your bones, you sexy motherfucker

You so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you au jus

Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo

Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you''

I believe people can change, but only for the worse

I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse

So satanic K-Mart chains panic

Cause they can't even spin back the curse words

Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker

(I fuck em - rape your mother)

And these kids are like parrots

They run around the house just like terrorists

Screaming ""fuck, shit, fuck""

Adult with a childish like arrogance

Wild ever since the day I came out I was like ""merits, fuck that""

I'd rather be loud and I like swearing

From the first album even the gals were like ""tight lyrics, dreamy eyes""

But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish

And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this

And the opposition felt the opposite

Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums

Often as I can and skim through all them bitches

To make sure I keep up with my competition

Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes

Borderline genius who's bored of his lines

And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now

Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies



[Hook]

This darkness comes in me

(Evil twin)

And comes again

That ain't me

He's just a friend who pops up now and again

So don't blame me, blame him

I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin



[Interlude]

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend

You have slept for quite some time



[Verse 2]

So who's left? Lady Gaga? Messed with the Bieber

Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither

Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever

Get the cloriseptic Excedrin aleve or extra strength Tylenol 3's

Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'

Bed ridden and destined to never leave the

Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger

My suicide notes, barely legible read the

Bottom, it's signed by The Joker

Lorena said I never can leave her

She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her

Fuck that shit, bitch

Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers

I'ever left it at beaver

Get them titties cut off trying to mess with the cleaver

Golly-wally, I bet he registered Jesus

Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definite lean

My destiny went on the steps, I met Deshaun at Osborn

I'd never make it to sophomore

I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors

Flip burgers and wash dishes, but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em

Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em

They was sleeping, I made them stop snorin'

Made them break out the popcorn

Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form

Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn

Screaming ''fuck the police'' like cop porn

Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn

Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4

ANd that includes Biggie and Pac, whore

And I got an evil twin, so who do you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?

And as crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him

And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?

But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)

Please come in, what was your name again?

Hi, faggot

Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there

Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair

And you're all aware I ain't got it all upstairs

Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there

Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me

That I should call the looney police to come get me

Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish somebody finally admit me

Into a mental hospital with Britney

Oh, LMFAO, no way, ho

Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no

Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony

Hey ho, hey ho

I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to hip hop hooray

No I'm hollering you got bottom-end like an 808

And a [bass] whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so

Let the low end raise, yo

Tango, what you think, ho?

Slow dancing or bowling

You trying to hold hands with your homie?

What? You think I'm looking for romance cause I'm lonely?

Change that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me

Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner

Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt

Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work

So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work

But all bullshit aside I hit a stride

Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed

As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side

And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize

Cause we are the same, bitch"

One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one ""ouch""
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger

In a dumb gown, black hood

With a scythe

Shit I laughed in his face spit

Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this

Now get your ass back in that game

Bitch don't take shit for granted

And don't take shit, give it!

Only bull you should take is by the horns

A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor

I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword

Finish writing then record

Replenish keep writing more

Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for

So you fight, scratch, you claw

Backs to wall

No one was there to catch you fall

You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off

You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and

Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it

Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'

Nobodies gonna back you in the corner

Throw a hornet

No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming

Like there's nothing that's more important

MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it

Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?

And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face

I ain't finished bitch

I meant in half, oil the blades

Nobody wants to play

They say I'm a spoiled little baby

But



[Hook]

Nobody put's baby in the corner

I'm only trying to warn ya

Cus that baby get's mad

And get's to throwing a tantrum

He'll fucking flip on ya



Cus' nobody put's baby in the corner

I'm only trying to warn ya

Cus that baby get's mad

And get's to throwing a tantrum

He'll fucking flip on ya



[Verse 2]

What goes through an addict's brain?

Besides static pain and big daddy kane

Break, beats and words

An erratic train of thought

Like splatter paint

Scatter brain

Yeah maybe why that explains

Why you're back but you don't rap the same

And you're looking way thinner

Because your hunger got you looking like

They took away dinner

Sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though

Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat

When you say you're a chooka what chooka what

Now fling that bitch from your fingertips

I hope it lands on another rap singers lips

Who can't think of shit

Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit

Whose king of this fucking English Lit?

Let your middle fingers flip

On each hand, whilst extending this shit

How low can you go?

Lower then Chuck D ho

Hear the bass of this in my voice

Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?

Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius

I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap

Not a man, I'm a weapon

Who just happened to be a rapper

Who just happen to be on the crapper

When it happened I had an epiphany

In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after

Now I'm back with an apper-tite

For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster

So let's eat cos' I'm famished

Every deed is a dastardly one

Evil its past it

Even you asking for me to be pulled

Like to people

Is like me having my teeth pulled



[Hook]



[Verse 3]

So step inside of dimension

The demented side of a mind

That's like the inside of an engine

While I multiply your undivided attention

But be reminded that if I didn't mention

I lose my mind and my temper

You'll be the first one

Who finds him offensive

Got him climbing the fences

Lost some time to addiction

But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary

I'm in the picture

Eminem is the synonym for it

I'm an enigma

Fuck it let's get to the meat, balls

I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes

Edgamacater, they are

Shit legends are madea

Spit treachreous data

Shit that you would say to your worst enemy

This wretchedness is

What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada

And combine em' with Method Man and Redman

Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand

And in his right there's a sledge-hammer

And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam

Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam

Maybe I need my head examined

Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb

Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan

I need meds!

Swear to god cus' If I go off the edge

T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man

Heart throb at a fart, ah nah

More like a smart slob, part blob

That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject

To the heart and leave claw marks

All over the Wal-Mart walls

Little baby with large balls

Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging

There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being

King of the playground

I hate the swings but I love being the underdog

Cos when I'm pushed

I end up swinging up"

Girl you gimme writers block
I'm at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?

That's what I call a Roethlisberger

You drive me bonkers I'm about to get my swerve on for sure

Thought I was pimpin until I felt like Nas, the first date

Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers

And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops or ???

Probably should of never let me call that job of yours

To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work

Should of been one of the first signs to cause to learn

Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I can't be apart from her

Cause nobodies body's awesomer - I lust it, and she loves me cause I'm popular, but...



[Hook: Jamie N Commons]

You know this ain't love

Oh, no, you know this ain't love

You know this ain't love

No, this ain't love

(What is it then?) It's desperation



She's lookin for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her

(It's desperation)

I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her



[Verse 2: Eminem]

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you til I went to the lengths I did to meet you

Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning

Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery

Cause now you see nothin but me, and I don't see nothin but you

And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in

We stuck to each others hips and we can't do anything individually

Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can't, specifically to describe it I just can't seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you

Talkin bout ""I live and breathe you""

And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me

As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer

Don't wanna be without you, don't wanna be with you neither, bitch

Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek, cause this ain't...



[Hook]



...and here I go again



[verse 3: Eminem]

Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else

What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick

I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz

I mean it's time that we just split and leave the games behind

Your frame of mind ain't the same as mine, I think

You need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?

That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up

To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's

You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? (what) ???

I'm just mad it took the time it took me to discover

You been using me for loot like I used you for looks

Thought you was too good for me, huh? ??? used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack, but I can't stomach this

I'm leavin you, not comin back. She said ""The fuck with that

Where's my Louisville Slugger at?""

She grabbed that fuckin bat and swung it at my head

I barely ducked and that's right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice

Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100 yard field goal, through the uprights

What is a nightmare? The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare
[Verse 1]
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop

And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons

Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching

Missouri from Michigan didn't work

So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan

Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again

Mom please stick to a decision

Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen she's like

Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are kryptonite

To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches

But I run into them, running through the kitchen

Pretending to be blind, Superman

Cos I had no supervision

But I did have a super power though

I could turn into invisible kid

Disappear out of sight, like a true magician

And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different

Music into the picture and it become my new religion

""I remember it clearly, even today""

Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned

Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping

Through the radio stations one day

And discovered this DJ who was mixing

I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the wizard

You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing

I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing

For shoes, fuck them stupid pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition

You get the new LL Cool J

Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and [?Hoover] and somehow I found my future is in this

That's how I know my mission

Little boom box boomin', spitting

Practicing numerous rhythms

When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'

I remember Proof would visit

Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go complete ballistic

Go through the roof for his shit

It's like we knew the instant

We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit

Never quit, too persistent



Started a group of misfits

Proof had a proposition

If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit

Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and

Be ready to come off the top as sharp position

If you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slippin'

They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you

And you forgot your written

Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again

It tried dong ditching shit

I fucking got that bitch in a headlock

Cut off his oxygen Slim

[??]

Now I got my pot to piss in



I'm in a league Muhammad's in

All these [?] bombing them

Probably end up on top of them

Stomping them like Ndamukong

I'm rushing at the

Flow vomits in your face

Competitors fall at my waist

You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face

So name the time, place to battle

Bitch I'm still in that mind state

Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes

Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose

But you turds better be careful how you choose yours

Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse

And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers

Ooh, no more trippin in bird shit, this songs a self empowerment surgeon

Words of encouragement but this [?]

The rap games God, but the name's not James Todd?, I'm just a wordsmith

So let these words lift

Cos all I got is bars for you dumbbells and doors ain't working out

Each verse is more [?] than the first

And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast? to get served



They shall not escape my vengeance



And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone

Word to Uncle Ron

I'm turning into an unhumble Don

You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on

So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on

Better back away from the front row, get gone

Bigger then Dikembe Mutumbo

I'm the fucking jungle tron

I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts

I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yard

So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass

And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap

The GOAT just ate eight acres, and ate the vet

Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper

Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook

Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot



Like oak wood was burning

Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside

Lookin' out, cause...



I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light



Yesterday was the tornado warning

Today's like the morning after: your world is torn in half

You wake in its wake to start the mourning process

And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress

Today's a whole new chapter

It's like an enormous asthma

Thunderstorm has passed ya

You weathered it and poked its eye out

With the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses

Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is

Stuffed, so focused on the bright side

Then you floor the gas pedal

And hit the corner fast, the more asserted

Never looking back, may hit the curb

But every day is a new learning curve

As you steer through life

Sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to

To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage

Cause they hurt you so bad

It's like they murdered your ass

And threw dirt on your casket

But you've returned from the ashes

And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline

And while you're burning the past

Standing in the inferno and chant



I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light



You're so familiarized

With what having to swallow this pill is like

It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life

And it's as though you feel you've died

Cause you've been killed inside

But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive

Although today you may weep, cause you're weakened

And everything seems so bleak and

Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'

It begins to seep in; that's the only thing keepin'

You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end

And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling

And with a little time that should do the healing

And by tomorrow you may even feel so good

That you're willing to forgive 'em

Even after all the shit you been put through, this feeling

Of resilience is building, and the flames are burning

Quick as fire would through this building

You're sealed in, but you're fireproof

Flame retardant, you withstood it

And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'

You look down, cause you're so over 'em

You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling



As time passes, things change every day

But wounds, wounds heal

But scars still remain the same

But tomorrow, today's going down in flames

Throw the match, set the past ablaze



So feel the fire beneath your feet

As you barely even perspire from the heat

Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief

And as you say goodbye to the grief

It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell

But you've extinguished this livin' hell

Still a little piece of you dies as you scream



I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light



I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn

Rising, a phoenix from the flames

I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine

Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly



And I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light"

I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder

Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition

It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an

80 degree day and theres no fricken air conditioning

And you can't see the big terrace risen

'Cus you got the windows up blaring the system in your chevrolet prism

The devil ain't on the level same as him

Just someone who rebels in straight masochism

And imagine him giving him an adjective an ass whooping so bad they should put his ass in prison

I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally

Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap

Caddilac from a K Car, My ass from a hole in a ground, still can't tell a [?]

Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud

To shop at k-mart and it became art

And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are

To this day I still get in fights with the same broad

At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart

In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a fuck I don't play!

You think you saw this basket first?

Yeah backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay

Illest shit you could think I would say

Mind's like a pile of clay

When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?

Put a gaping hole in it

Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State

Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state

And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates

So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray

But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face [?]

And this got nothing to do with a scalar

[?]

By the way thoughts are getting darker by the day

I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay

It's a fucking miracle to be this lyrical

Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face I'm insane

Every rhyme I say [?] like an ultra violet ray

I'm sellin hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat

$11.99 so come on and pile a plate

I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise

With the rhyme I'm spittin while I'm shittin' on the competition

In the meantime it's always mean time

I don't see why these people always got my back

But I was put here not by accident

I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish

Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit

And I'm coming to get that quarter back

Your mama can ask me for my autograph

That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book

But I sure would fall for that

You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight

When I get on the mic I'm a snap

Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital when I overdosed would have caught a flat

If it feels like I'm running away with the game

Cry till you get puffed eyes red face

But I'm leaving on this jet plane

I'm sick of pounding a squarepagan around all ?? of the catchrays

But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace

Cuz you just ain't big enough to fit your damage ???

Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase

Cuz baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds I peed my bed

I'm going blind I don't see my legs I keep on falling down

No wonder you can't stand me I need my cane

Someone help me I think my face is melting

You ???my grains these maggot in my brain

So to not see him with me would be a shocking image

And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is

Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it

Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member

Begging my mom for K-Mart McGregors

Cause they were new, St. Vincent de Paul

But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it

You know I got you open, word, don't front

You know I got you open, kid, yo why you frontin'?

Rest in peace to Big Proof

You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me

Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me

I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete

I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet

I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne

Better watch the fucking tone that you speak

Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league

On my mothafuckin' own, it's just me

No opponents can compete

And I've never been known to retreat

From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat

I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say ""Bon appétit!""

Cause I don't know what to eat

Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine

It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown

Cause I rhyme like I'm still trying to get signed

Up in the Ebony Show-case

Never asked you like my shit from the get

I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch

You had you a nice run, now take a hike

I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first

The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'

Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?

You don't like it? Suck a cock!

Almost forgot, before I signed with the Doc

I almost signed with Duck Down

Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud

They jerked me around, so what's up now?

Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like

Rubbing it in and holding some grudge now? But don't front

You know I got you open, word, don't front

You know I got you open, kid, yo why you frontin'?

You know I got you open, kid



Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write

Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe

But wear diapers, cause you might leave a streak

I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe

It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump into tonight

Cause I'm hyper or something

Needing someone or something is lighting

This fire under me, it's breathing new life

It's like I already died once

I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny

My days of being broke were so long ago

I lost all concept of money

But you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me

I'm having a stroke of genius

Elizabeth, I'm coming to you, honey

From boy to man

And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland

No offense? Yes offense

That are nutty with the flow

But convince me you've heard

An MC since me who's as good

With the fucking mincing of words, without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve

Who's mentally disturbed

You might as well stick a knife in me and turn

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla

A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby ""The

Same reason I wrestle with mania

Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up

Consider it to cross me a costly mistake

If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia

ADHD, hydroxycut

Pass the Courvoisi' (Hey, hey)

In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate

Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday

This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A

Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flings

They cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)



Monster

You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)

I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)

When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers

I look like a villain outta those blockbusters

Godzilla, fire spitter, monster

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet



I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls

Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off

It's impossible to list 'em all

And in the midst of all this

I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball

Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?

Risperdal, voices whisper

My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn

This is just the song to go ballistic on

You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher

I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological

Quick to tell a bitch go off like a fifth of Vodka

When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

If you never gave a damn, raise your hand

'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans

I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is

The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)

How can I have all these fans and perspire?

Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire

And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire

These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier

I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers

And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw

'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball

Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy

'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)

Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher

Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care

But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her

Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez

Christian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well

So they wanna give me the chair

Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Caray

'Cause every time a Dick and Harry carry and marry a motherfuckin' dictionary

Got 'em swearing up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious

It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column

We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem

Get the shaft like a staring column (Mark Jack)

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink

Give 'em half of the bad beats

Evil, that means take a back seat

Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single

Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people

Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle

I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto

Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

Other words, I Minute Maid 'em

I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage

I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him

Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake

Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em

And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid

And don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill

And I tell 'em kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla

You're bringin' the killer within me out of me

You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me

Or be recievin' enemy, what stupidity it'd be

Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter

When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck

Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me

A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me

I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable

You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable

I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

I'm not afraid to pull the

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules

I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose

Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food

Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you

Fuck you too, woah!



Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move

Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice

Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice



Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall

Turn my back on you all and you're finished

Back to these bullets, it's back to the job

Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'

Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'

These packs and I'm actually pumpin'

Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'

You might've went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'

I'm actually buzzin' this time

Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine

I do not fuck with you guys

If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time

I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers

Some chains and some blades in and a couple of knives

Choppers and jammies, a partridge in a pear tree

My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies

Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo)

They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)

I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno

Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo

You play your cards, I reverse on you all

And I might just drop four like an Uno

Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo

They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto

Lookin' for something that prolly can never find out

Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now

What you would nigga? You really want me tied down

I've been alone and I never needed nobody

Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down

Keep all of the money, I never wanted the lifestyle

I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now

I said ain't no love for the other side

Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)

When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope

You in the wrong cab down the wrong path

Nigga wrong way, the wrong road

Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast

I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower



I have said a lotta things in my day, I admit it

This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it

I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em

Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition

Fuck's the difference?

I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules

Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose

I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full

I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me

Fuck you think? (woo!)



I got a couple of mansions

Still I don't have any manners

You got a couple of ghost writers

But to these kids it don't actually matter

They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""

I said, ""I don't have any answers.""

'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album

It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers

And actually comin' from humble beginnings

I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning

I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""

We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling

But nothin' is stealing like anyone has any fuckin' ability

To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility

Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'

Songs about nothin' and mumble!

And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular

Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up

Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck

About the ones that were here before you to make raps, it's recap

Way back, MC's that recap and tape decks

ADAT's with the G raps and Kane's hat

We need 3 stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back

Because half of these rappers have brain damage

All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap

I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad

But in fact with a old-me at the same cat that would take that

Feedback and aim back, I need that

But I think it's inevitable

They all got button to press or a lever to pull

They give me the snap though (lil' bitch)

And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big

But you've been takin' the dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)

On the brink in a minute

Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything

With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits

I'ma sleep at the wheel again

As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent

Of another beat 'em and kill again

'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again

Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the Manidon

It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram

And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again

Levels to this shit, I got an elevator

You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker

I sound like a broken record every time I break a record

Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator

Motherfucker never got a right to be this way

I got spite inside my DNA

But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy

It's the moment y'all been waitin' for

Like California wishin' rain would pour

And that drought y'all have been prayin' for

My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw

Still the same Marshall that outlaw

That they say is a writer might've fell off

But back on that bull like the cowboys



So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move

Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice

Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"

With my arms out wide
I open my eyes

And now

All I wanna see

Is a sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up

I would never do nothin to let you cowards fuck my world up

If I was you I would duck or get struck like lighting fighters

Keep fighting

Put your lighters up

Point em' skyward UH!

Had a dream I was king

I woke up

Still king

This rap game's nipples is mine

For the milking

Till nobody else even fuckin feels me

Till it kill me

I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in the music

There is

Or there ever will be

Disagree? Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing, to ever give up,

Only thing I ever gave ups using

No more excuses

Excuse me if my head's to big for this building

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick

But you cocks are slick

Poppin shit on how you flipped your life around

Crock of shit

Who you dicks tryna' kid?

Flip dick you did opposite

You stayed the same

Cause cock backwards is still cock you prick

I love it when I tell'em shove it

Cause it wasn't that

Long ago

When Marshall sat

Flustered, lack lustered

Cause he couldn't cut

Mustered

Muster up

Nothin

Brain fuzzy

Cause hes buzzing

Woke up from that buzz and now you wonder

Why he does it how he does

Wasn't cause he had

Buzzards circlin' round his head

Waitin for him to drop dead, was it?

Or was it cause some bitches wrote him off

Little hussy ass fusses

Fuck it

Guess it doesn't matter now does it?

What difference it make

Whats it take?

To get it through you thick skulls that this ain't

Some bullshit

People don't usually come back this way

From a place that was as dark as I was

And just to get to this place

Some of these words be like a switchblades to a hater's rib cage

And let it be known that from this day forward

I wanna just say thanks

Cause your hate is what gave me the strength

So let them bics raise

Cause I came at 5'9""

But I feel like I'm 6'8""

Living out our dreams

Where are right where we should be

By the time you hear this I probably already be outie

I advance like going from toting iron to goin

And buying 4 or 5 of the homies, to iron man outie

My daddy told me, slow down boy you're going to blow it

And I ain't gotta stop to be the minute to tell shady I love the same way that he did Dr. Dre on the chronic

Tell'em how real he is

Or how high I am

Or how I would kill him, for him to know it

I cry when he tears

My daddy gotta bad back

So its only right that I write

Till he can march right in to that post office and tell'em to hang it up

Now his careers Lebron's jersey in twenty years

I stop when I'm at the very top

You shitted on me on your way up

Its bout to be a scary drop

Cause what goes up

Must come down

You goin down

I'm somethin you don't wanna see

Like a hairy box

Every hour

Happy hour now

Life is wacky now

Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy

Now I'm just a cat's meow

Owwww

I'm (?)

Always down for the catch-way

Like Pacquio

Yall are doomed

I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me

My car starts itself

Parks itself

And auto-tunes

Cause now I'm in the astin

I went from having my city locked up

To getting treated like (kronica patrick?)

And now I'm fantastic

Compared to a weed high

And yall' niggas the sky sippin like bitches

On a radio and TV

See me, we fly

Yall' buggin out like Wendy Williams

Starin' at a bee hive

And how real is that?

I remember signing my first deal

Now I'm the second best

I can deal with that

Now Bruno can show his ass

Without the MTV awards gag



[Bridge]

You and I

Know what its like

To be kicked down

Forced to fight

But tonight

We're alright

So hold up your lights

Let it shine

Cause..

Like trying to fight off a gnat



Still stackin' my chips, hoes, higher than Shaq on his tiptoes

Atop the Empire State Buildin', this shit is like child's play, children

I will not annihilate, kill them, I'll fuck around and pile eight million

Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then, I'll await my trial date 'til then

So you know which side that I'm on

If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved

It'll be like K9's in a brawl

But not similar to Mike Vick at all

'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight

They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog

Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms

Which is what separates my flow from theirs, so that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me

So vocalistically (What?), that's social distancing (Yeah)

Flow going viral, you best stay strapped

With that Lysol and get way back

Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax

'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback

Bitch, back the fuck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (Face mask)

'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything

This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (Damn)

'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem like they just keep getting more extreme

Who knows when this nightmare will end? Like Monroe, Norma Jean

Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine

Woah, wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here

Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square

My hair trigger whenever I get an idea

Fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop

And my drip was a drop

In the bucket, so that gun shot

You just heard just now in that one spot

Just came from the nine mil' that I just got

That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded

I ain't even mean to go the fuck off

I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate

Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy

I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'

Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating

I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded

Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia

With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T

Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault

When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly

I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on

Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close

You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony

I'm at the crib with your ho, got her at the pole like voting with no clothing

Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating

I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing

Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her

So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner

Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her

Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river

But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her

With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it

And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour

Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause



They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID)

You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat)

Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)

Your pussy lyric,

I couldn't hear it,

Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyrics,

Who?

Heres a clue.

He came to the ball in his wifebeater,

Lost his nike shoe, its in ya ass, he's in ya ass,

He's all up in ya psychy too.

But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)
Why, are expectations so high?

Is it the bar I set?

My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach

A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as

Soon as I grab, squeeze

I lose my grip like the flying trapeze

Into the dark, I plummet

Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark's high

Butterflies rip apart my stomach

Knowing that no matter what bars I come with

You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow

So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis

I feel the ice cracking, because



I walk on water

But I ain't no Jesus

I walk on water

But only when it freezes



It's the curse of the standard

That the first of the Mathers disc set

Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet

Will this step just be another misstep

To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect I've garnered?

The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless

And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark

'TIl I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart

Like, ""this shit is garbage""

God's given me all this

Still I feel no different regardless

Kids look to me like as a god, this is retarded

If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive

And I try to not listen to nonsense

But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence

Mission accomplished

I'm not God-sent

Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so



I walk on water

But I ain't no Jesus

I walk on water

But only when it freezes



'Cause I'm only human, just like you

Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew

I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do

'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh



It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess

At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest

A flawed human, I guess

But I'm doing my best to not ruin your ex-

pectations and meet 'em, but first, the ""Speedom"" verse

Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast

Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?

There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm

Every album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on

And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on

But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun

Am I lucky to be around this long?

Begs the question, though

Especially after the methadone

As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground

And all that's left of my house is lawn

The crowds are gone

And it's time to wash out the blonde

Sales decline, the curtains drawn

They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind

And everyone who has doubt, remind

Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times

Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes

And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine

'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight

When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?

But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine

I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine

But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause...



I walk on water

But I ain't no Jesus

I walk on water

But only when it freezes



'Cause I'm only human, just like you

Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew

I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do

'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh



If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike

So me and you are not alike

Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""

But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it
Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what

If that means what I think it means

We're in trouble, big trouble

And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances

You are just what the doc ordered



I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes

I got a laptop in my back pocket

My pen'll go off when I half-cock it

Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a livin' and a killin' off it

Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office

With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his, nutsack

I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and as indecent as all hell

Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop

You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap

Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'

Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack

And at the exact same time

I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that

I'll still be able to break a mothafuckin' table

Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic

I was signed to Aftermath after the fact

How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs

Feel my wrath of attack

Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad

It's actually disastrously bad for the wack

While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece



Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret

To rap immortality like I have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's

Simply rage and youthful exuberance

Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

Hit the Earth like an asteroid

Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew)

MC's get taken to school with this music

Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""

Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up

Blow up and be in a position

To meet RunD.M.C., and induct them

Into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames

Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

On the wall of (shame)

You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames

Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

Little gay-looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy

You're witnessing a massacre, like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy

""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"", that's all they say, looking boy

You get a thumbs up, pat on the back

And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, looking boy

Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy?

I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, looking boy

I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit

Get outta my face, looking boy!

Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable

Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy



Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR

Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God

Kneel before General Zod

This planet's Krypton; no, Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent

Let off then I'm reloadin'

Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'

And I should not be woken; I'm the walking dead

But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin'

But I got your mom deep throatin'

I'm out my Ramen Noodle

We have nothing in common, poodle

I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm

And pay homage, pupil

It's me, my honesty's brutal

But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while

So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes

To maybe try to help get some people through tough times

But I gotta keep a few punchlines

Just in case, cause even you unsigned

Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime

I know there was a time where once I

Was king of the underground

But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

Appeal with the skin color of mine

You get too big and here they come tryin' to

Censor you, like that one line

I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Mathers LP 1 when I tried to say

""I'll take seven kids from Columbine

Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9""

See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal, coming through the portal

You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though

And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for

You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking Cornrows

You write normal? Fuck being normal

And I just bought a new raygun from the future

Just to come and shoot ya

Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad

Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad

Singing to a man while they played piano

Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel

So Ray J went straight to the radio station

The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""

Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)

Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma

You assuming I'm a human

What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman

Innovative and I'm made of rubber

So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me

And it'll glue to you and

I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating

Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting

For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating

Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated

I make elevating music, you make elevator music

""Oh, he's too mainstream""

Well, that's what they do when they get jealous

They confuse it; ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop""

Cause I found a hella way to fuse it

With rock, shock rap with Doc

Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it

""I don't know how to make songs like that

I don't know what words to use""

Let me know when it occurs to you

While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you

It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you

How many verses I gotta murder to

Prove that if you were half as nice

Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?

Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie

But look at the accolades these skills brung me

Full of myself, but still hungry

I bully myself, cause I make me do what I put my mind to

And I'm a million leagues above you

Ill when I speak in tongues

But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!

I'm drunk, so Satan, take the fucking wheel!

I'm asleep in the front seat

Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""

But in my head there's something

I can feel tugging and struggling

Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate

But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have

Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic

To the situation and understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons

Make lemonade then!

But if I can't batter the women

How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?

Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake

If you think I need to be overseas

And take a vacation to trip a broad

And make her fall on her face and

Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not

Why be a king when you can be a God?"

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is

I can only tell you what it feels like

And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe

I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight

As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate

It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer

I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown

She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, and I love it

Wait, where you going?, I'm leaving you

No, you ain't, come back!

We're running right back, here we go again

It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great

I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed

I snap, Who's that dude?, I don't even know his name

I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again

I guess I don't know my own strength



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



You ever love somebody so much

You can barely breathe when you're with them?

You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them

Got that warm fuzzy feeling

Yeah, them chills used to get them

Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them?

You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them

Now you're in each other's face

Spewing venom in your words when you spit them

You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them

Throw them down, pin them

So lost in the moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls you both

So they say it's best to go your separate ways

Guess that they don't know you

'Cause today, that was yesterday

Yesterday is over, it's a different day

Sound like broken records playing over

But you promised her next time you'd show restraint

You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game

But you lied again

Now you get to watch her leave out the window

Guess that's why they call it window pane



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



Now, I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean

And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines

But your temper's just as bad as mine is

You're the same as me

When it comes to love, you're just as blinded

Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me

Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems

Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano

All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk

Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?

Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball

Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall

Next time? There won't be no next time

I apologize even though I know it's lies

I'm tired of the games, I just want her back

I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again

I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie"

Fame was a switch but I was grateful to trade that shit for the trailer with the hitch

Can't nothing hold me I'm on the loose

Born a winner, damn it's so hard to lose

I can do it and do it, when I'm tryin' to

This atmosphere's for a chosen few

Who was on their grind, to get money moves

And you ain't gon' get that if you want it down

You gotta take shots with 100 proof



Check that

Been in survival mode

Since a five year old, it was I alone

Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone

But lookin' back how bad it was then

If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen

Addict mom and deadbeat dad

I wouldn't have the savage within

Havin' to win, every single battle I'm in

All I ever wanted was to be an MC

Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me

EPMD must've had teachin' degrees

Learn to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes

Would be as easy as eatin' graffiti

Would be like remedial readin' to me (Yeah)

'Til my last breath leave my lungs, I'ma beat my drums (Yeah)

Gotta remind em (Yeah)

I take a foe out (Yeah), like fee-fi-fum

You see my fist, fuck a peach pipe bum (What?)

With this beat I brung for the beef I come (Woo)

But you better bring it if you wanna reply from

That'll be an uphill battle

So everybody, everybody, shake your body



Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?

Khakis pressed, Nike shoes just being fresh laced

So I guess it ain't

Dead after shave of cologne that made him just faint

Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint

So if love is a chess game, check mate



But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang -- bang, bang

Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing

So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang

P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow

Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow

Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel

Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how

At least I know that I don't know

Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid

Hope so, now ho...



Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), 

all night long

Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), 

all night long



We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down

So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.

So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go

Say fck it before we kick the bucket

Life's too short to not go for broke

So everybody, everybody, get your vials



They say that love is powerful as 

cough syrup and Styrofoam

All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo

With the ugly Kardashian

Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low

Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past

But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow

And girl I ain't got no money to borrow

But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!

Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know

Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur's Cargo's

Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man

You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman

Unless you're a swallow

Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl

This is your jam, unless you got toe jam



Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), 

all night long

Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), 

all night long



We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down

So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.

So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go

Say fck it before we kick the bucket

Life's too short to not go for broke

So everybody, everybody, get your vials"

I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyric off of this paper before I lay 'em

But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em

'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem

When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world

Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me

I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably

And all those who look down on me

I'm tearin' down your balcony

No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or ""how can he""

From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's

Still shittin', whether he's on salary, paid hourly

Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse

He's married to the game

Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas: his gift is a curse

Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt

And fuck the whole Universe



I'm not afraid to take a stand

Everybody, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road



Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap

I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm

For you to know it's a wrap

You said you was king, you lied through your teeth

For that, fuck your feelings

Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back

I promise to never go back on that promise

In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhhh

Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now

All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack BLAOW

Cause I ain't playin' around

There's a game called circle and I don't know how

I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out

Thought I had it mapped out

But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud

Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons

These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now



I'm not afraid to take a stand

Everybody, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road



And I just can't keep livin' this way

So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage

I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons

I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground

I've had enough, now I'm so fed up

Time to put my life back together right now



It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me

Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you

So I could come back a brand-new me

You helped see me through

And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I've been through the wringer

But they can do little to the middle finger

I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of

My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers

And drop dead: no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise

To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father

So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters

And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it

Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club

Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up

Cause I'm raisin' the bar

I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars

I feel amazin', and I'm



I'm not afraid to take a stand

Everybody, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

Yeah, man... what the fuck? Yo, yo Snoop (oh man) let me see them buds, man... that shit's the size of my hand, Dogg- maybe I'll relapse, what the fuck...
That's how I know that I'm in the studio with the Doggy
In Californ-E, 'cuz my homie from Long Beach
Always got that bomb weed, that's why I feel a calm breeze

Every time I palm trees (get it) just like that blonde bleach

I went platinum, then so did my albums, Calvin's turning me into a zombie

Cuz these buds are like The Hulk, they're twice the size that his arm be (his zombie)

And that is some strong green

Got a contact, my contact lenses are foggy, I might end up in Walgreen's

Pharmacy with my arm asleep gone off lean mixed with Dramamine

I will treat Paula Dean like a fuckin' human pinball machine

Bouncin' balls off her tonsils, if ya'll are seekin' the smoke I got all the weed

I am a walking motherfuckin' Marijuana leaf

And I'm here to stay

My reign's so definite (deaf in it) my longevity needs a hearing aid, still wearing Hanes

T-shirts I done bodied some features with legendary names

Was there when Dre turned the Chronic to monetary gain

'Cause dope is addictive just like they call it marijuana, cause like marriage, you wanna, marry Jane

It's like you and Spiderman feel the very same

My adversaries came

But these little degenerates are my lineage, when it comes to pockets weren't many if, any as skinny as mine bitch, I was penniless

Now I'm plenty rich, and the shit don't make any sense (cents) I was in a motherfucking pinch like a titty twist

Now I'm sitting as pretty as each penny is, while I'm penning this in the lab on you guinea pigs

I'm finna' fool, I'm in effect, gimmie the semi and when I pull the big guns out

That trigger pull it until the motherfuckin' shit runs out of bullets

Somebody better call an ambulance

You live, it will be miraculous, I got more hits than a contract killer

Like caterpillars that don't got antennas, other words I don't got no god damn fillers (feelers)

Mt. Westmore, you did not plan for this- from Detroit all the way to Los Angeles



Put your doobies high, if you reside in 213

Let's see them blunts raised

Whether you Eastside or Westside of the 313

Let's see them guns blaze



Make money moves like the matrix

Make more mount motivation

Roll up, more meditation

I'm watching the moves that you make might wanna stick to the basics

Military mindset, locked in, cocked in, making sure the mission is profitable

Ain't no mission impossib-ble

One phone call and my monsters will go

Dump phones, hop in a Mazda and go

Fuck that, y'all stay

Nigga I'm finna go

Think you slick, boy this Crip

You ain't ready to take it where I'm finna go

Mafia rules

You making a mockery, me a monopoly

Speak on my flow, my nigga I'm mopping 'em

Slept on my flo' now niggas is copying

Niggas be opping through all this opulence

Give me a task, I conquer it

This ain't the time for pondering

You niggas is slandering this real shit niggas be honoring

On god

You looking for followers and not watching my niggas that's following

Nigga fuck them likes

I'm like like what, like my nigga young Problem

East side, East up

My nigga Eminem woke the beast up

Let ya'll ride now a nigga want it back like the lease up

Think it's a game you gone see sum

Ain't no peace, you'll be missing a piece of ya

Niggas popped off, now sheets on 'em

Mama all mad, kids all sad, damn my bad

Send a few coins to the coroner

Please make a sweet for 'em

Nigga I don't hop on tracks I leap on 'em

In the fields with the cleats on 'em

Steve Job of the cannabis mob

In due time, nigga knew it be mine

Suge knew I'd go platinum the minute I signed

If you're looking for the facts, I'm the nigga to find

Young nigga sold crack in the middle of pine

To being the face of this cripping

Long Beach, these seas is different

4 man with the put on

Still getting bread with the niggas I put on

Yea, yea

I Put my hood on

Shit got cold I put my hood on

Yea, yea

Marshall and Calvin, both from the gutter like public housing

Now we both performing for 100's of thousands

Wearing no makeup, but we still be clowning muthafuckas!

Our world's on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told

We're going nowhere fast



I feel sorry for this beat

Sympathy pains for this track

This road is taking me back

Down memory lane with this rap

I can still look out in this crowd

Be wowed and be taken aback

I'm simply stating a fact

I had Wembley Stadium packed

But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and, fast

Another terrorist attack, like a tariff grows

Half of Madison Square up, alas

We perish in the blast but that doesn't scare us

We pass no one, we're fearless

'Cause we're just



Ashes blowing in the air

Our world's on fire but we don't care, yeah

Wasted youth, always on the road

Never looking back and we're never getting old

'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold

Fuck doing what you're told

We're going nowhere fast



'Cause we're going no, going no

Going no, going no

Going no, going nowhere

Going nowhere fast



Fuck doing what you're told, act like a two-year old

Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways

For MC's it's a funeral when I'm devising this rhyme

'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning

That's why I rise and I shine

Like a new day has dawned on me

Gusto guts bravado nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot

I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle

'Cause some stuff that's awful really don't mean nothing all though

There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow

But if at times my heart it seems like it's in the wrong place

It's probably cause it's on my sleeve

Keanu Reeves speed of life

Avoid or veer or just steer toward it

We're only looking forward but

Where we're going, we have no idea

Nowhere to go but hysterical

It's getting warm in here, I set the world on fire

Was born to be an arsonist

Just one spark and it's lit

But I'ma still get dark on this shit

Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch

War machine but you've forced me in a corner

I'm sure to have something for your ear

And in the course of the assault is torture, it's more severe

Go to war with me or end up blew to Timbuktu

I send at you a ten ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un

And end up blewn in your career

All in all, it's said and done

And at the end of my run, I just rewind clocks

Forever young, make time stop

Will I ever fall off, that day'll never come

To the Pine box, bitch fuck you

I'm better than I ever was

'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does but

I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause this

World's screwed, it's already fucked and I'm on top

So everyone's just



Ashes blowing in the air

Our world's on fire but we don't care, yeah

Wasted youth, always on the road

Never looking back and we're never getting old

'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold

Fuck doing what you're told

We're going nowhere fast



'Cause we're going no, going no

Going no, going no

Going no, going nowhere

Going nowhere fast



You can't tell us nothing

Hard-headed and we're stubborn

So, one ear and out the other we're young

Who knows what the future for us could hold

Another shooter, uh oh

no more tomorrow's we're done

And all we are is



Ashes blowing in the air

Our world's on fire but we don't care, yeah

Wasted youth, always on the road

Never looking back and we're never getting old

'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold

Fuck doing what you're told

We're going nowhere fast



'Cause we're going no, going no

Going no, going no

Going no, going nowhere

Gotta concentrate against the clock I race

Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace

Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape

Guess I got a chronic case

And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face

I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say

And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways

You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""

One last time for Charlemagne

If my response is late, it's just how long it takes

To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away

These rappers are like Hunger Games

One minute, they're mocking Jay

Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake

Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away

But all the hate I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate

I've had as much as I can tolerate

I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience

I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once

You want it, Shady? You got it!



Don't fall on my face

Yeah

Don't fall on my faith, oh

Don't fall on my fate

Light him up!

Don't fall on my faith, oh

Rrr

Don't fall on my fate

Look



Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it

Or have his body baggage zipped

The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches

And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks

Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly

Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot

Lacking with it, ""he ain't spit like this in his last shit""

Hoe, you better go back and listen

You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow up, let up

Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup

Hopin' that you rappers fall in that

Dre said, ""Hold your head up""

Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition, this is how I shot a head (pew)

Gabby Giffords, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business

Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch

It's not just 'cause you lack attention

It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sacrilegious

If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better

Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together some words, more than two letters

The fans waited for this moment

Like the feature when I stole this show

Sorry if I took forever



Don't fall on my face

Don't fall on my faith, oh

I won't

Don't fall on my fate

Light him up!

Don't fall on my faith, oh

Ha

Don't fall on my fate

It's too easy



Just remember–I was here before you

And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you

Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew

Just what the doctor ordered

Revenge is the best medicine

Increase the dose, unleash the monster

Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches

So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em

See the show, every parasite needs a host

Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of

All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered

Time to separate the sheep from goats

And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts

When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer

A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air

Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror

That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care

But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists

On the scale it turns to minus

Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm barely gettin' started

And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone

Or I'll show you an Elvis clone

Walk up in this house you own

Brush my pelvic bone

You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote

Put my feet up and just make myself at home

I belong here, clown!

Don't tell me 'bout the culture

I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh

Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, pissed and moaned, but I'm not gonna fall... bitch!

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles

Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll

Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em

When the going got rough

Show em what I done thought that was the worse, little sissy

Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?

There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse

The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse

Yeah, I don't try like Captain, I might as well

Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve

Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall

But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself

Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself

Inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go

In the waters where nobody else has gone before

Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so

Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant

When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you

When you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel

I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel

Convert it to gunpowder too

Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid

Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing

Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it

Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it

Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise

Never take back what you say

If you stay trapped in your brain, engage in this fueled cage match

Take your fists to his bones

Step into the unknown

And find yourself your glory, free the ignoring person



Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-up valve

Can't even cut the power to it, when it's what allowed

Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground

Cause I worked my butt off now

It's a subject I don't know how to shut up about

Cause I stuck it out

Like a motherfucking tongue to tie, I responded when I got shoved around

You're gonna have non-believers

But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how

Get it how you live

But are you prepared to give more than you get?

And put in twice what you get back from this shit

Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give

Rap is my shiv

But it's like my shield at the same time I wield, I'ma knife this will

Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill

How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt

I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb

Ready to face it, each challenge waitin'

Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation

Look what I have built, reputation is delegation

The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing

Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement

An accusation... I am legendary status, in fact

That is the only way you'll ever be able to say

Your legend is makin' an allegation

I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with

As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath

Managed to prove who the best man is

Surveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing

In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage

Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw

Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed

Cause I am



I am phenomenal

With every ounce of my blood

With every breath in my lungs

Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal

'Cause after I spit the bullets, I'm a treat these shell casings like a soccer ball

I'm a kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'm a live this



[Hook:]

Livin' life in the fast lane

Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down

Only got a gallon in the gas tank

But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now



I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride

Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die

I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)

I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)

Royce



[Royce Da 5'9"":]

My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit

At war with' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs

My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins

I made a pact with the Devil that says ""I'll let you take me

You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse, Jack Kevorkian""

Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in

I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down

My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers

Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity



[Eminem:]

Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper

Chewed him up (Pt!) and spitted him out

Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down

He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now

Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town

Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck them all, he's just

A whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time a-r-r-round

And he came to the club tonight with' 5'9″ to hold this bitch down

Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown

Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated

Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, I'm agitated, aggravated

To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated

Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it



[Royce Da 5'9"":]

And then after takin' that, I'm a catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'

It's gon' say ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affadavit

Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator

To Michael Jackson' activator (Woo!)

Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data

Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer

Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater

Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper

Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)



[Eminem:]

Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes

What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator

Brung ya lay to this party, be my penis ejaculator later

Tell you boyfriend that you just struck paydirt

You rollin' with' a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'



[Hook:]

Livin' life in the fast lane

Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down

Only got a gallon in the gas tank

But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now



I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride

Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die

I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over



(Verse 1)



If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud

Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found

That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now

You try, it'll be them doors, Andre's phatom, believe me clowns

That means suicide homie, you'll never throw me

Off of this course, blow me

Bitch I do this all for the sport only

But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards homie

And the balls in my court, and it's lonely

On top of the world when you're the only

One with the balls in your shorts

To leave them jaws on the floor with no re-

morse, remember that when they get to doggin' you boy homie

So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna

I'm not gonna stop the saga

Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi

I'm moppin the floors with them, I keep tryna pass it

But they keep on droppin' the torch

And it won't be, long til this sport is O-V-

E-R, Just Blaz and we knockin' them doors and no we

ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be

Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me

Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P

Let me guide you through the smoke G

If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely

No one who knew me like you will ever know me

I don't think you understand how much you meant to me



(Hook)



The days are cold, livin' without you

The nights are long, I'm growing older

I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you

You may be gone, but you're never over



And it don't stop (oh)

And it don't quit (oh)

And it don't stop (oh)

And it don't quit (oh)

And I miss you (oh)

I just miss you (oh)

I just miss you (oh)

Homie, I'll never forget you (no)



(Verse 2)



For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life

So sick it'll blow up the mic, It'll put the dyna in mite

Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit hisself

Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself

Yeah it's the best thing I could do, right now for you Doodi is to rap

Sp I'mma fuck til' I die, yeah I'mma do it to death

And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life

Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'mma need two mics

Cuz the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right

There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped

Just finished the rhyme and bust it and excuse the corny metaphor

They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered

So God just help me out while I fight through this greivin' process

Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous

But this depression ain't takin me hostage

I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways

You had faith in me always

Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes

Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards

And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em homes

I'll own so many belts the only place they can hit me is below 'em

Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same with you

I woulda never came in this game, I'm going insane without you

Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you

You told me to get up, I got up and spread my wings and I flew

You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you

You told me nah Dudey, you're not layin' on that table I knew

I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew

There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof

Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you

Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think I don't feel grateful, I do

Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through

So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you

I love you Dudey



(Hook)



The days are cold, livin' without you

The nights are long, I'm growing older

I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you

You may be gone, but you're never over



And it don't stop (oh)

And it don't quit (oh)

And it don't stop (oh)

And it don't quit (oh)

I just miss you (oh)

You're walkin down a horror corridor

It's almost 4 in the mornin

And your in a

Nightmare

It's HORRIBLE

Right there's the coroner

Waitin for you

To turn the corner

So he can corner ya

Your a goner

He's ona ya

Out the corner of his cornea

He just saw you run

All you want is to rest

Cause you can't run anymore

Your done

All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience

While everybody

Is watchin in the party applauding it

Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again

Contemplading my next plot again

Swallowin the Klonopin

While I'm noddin

In and out on the autumn and

If the ramada inn

Holdin onto the pill bottle then

Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom

And make sure I got all of it

Wake up naked at mcdonalds

With

Blood all over me

Dead bodies

Behind the counter

SHIT

Guess I must of just blacked out again

NOT AGAIN



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



(Verse 2)

Sitting nude in my living room

It's almost noon

I wonder what's on the tube

Maybe they'll show some boobs

Surfing every channel

Until I find hannah montana

Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin

Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin

Every candle on top of the fire place

Mantalin

Grab my flannel and my bandana then

Kiss the naked manakin man again

You can see him standin in my

Front window

If you look in

I'm just a hooligan

Who's use to usin hallicinogens

Causin illusions again

Brain contusions again

Cutting and bruising the skin

Raise the scissors and pins

Jesus when does it end

Phases that I go through

Dazed and I'm so confused

Days that I don't know who

Gave these molecules too

Me

What am I gone do

Had the prodical son

The diabolical one

Very methodical

I slaughtered them



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



(Verse 3)

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again



I duck and I slash slice and gash

Last night was a blast

I can't quite remember when I

Had that much fun

Off a half pint of the jack

My last vic and a half

A flashlight

Up kim kardashians ass



I remember the first time

I dismembered a family member

December I think it was

I was having drinks with my cuz

And I wrapped him

In christmas lights

Pushed him into the stinkin tub

Cut him up into pieces

Then just when I went to drink his

Blood

I thought I outta drink this bath water

That outta be fun

That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun

The sight of blood excites me

That might be an artery son

Your blood curdling screams

Just don't seem to bother me none

It's 3 am

And here I come

So you should probably run

A secret passage way around here

Man there's got to be one

Oh no there's probably none

He can scream all that he wants

Top of his lungs

It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)



(Chorus)

Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em

We clutch it isnt much
But its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
Its lust its torcherous
You must be a socerous cause you just
Did the impossible

Game I trust dont play games itll be dangerous

If you fuck me over

Cause if I get burnt imma show you what its like to hurt

Cause I been treated like dirt before ya

And love is evil

Spell it backwards I'll show ya



Nobody knows me I'm cold

Walk down this road all alone

Its noones fault but my own

Its the path ive chosen to go

Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so

Dont ask me why I have no love for these mufuckin hos

Bloodsuckin suckubusses what the fuck is up with this

Ive tried in this department but I aint had no luck with this



Its sucks but its exactly what I thought it would be

Like tryin to start over

I gotta hole in my heart I'm some kind of emotional rollercoaster

Somethin I wont go on til you toy with my emotion so its over

Its like an explosion everytime I hold ya wasnt jokin when I told ya

Ya take my breathe away

Your a supernova.. and I'm a



I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

250 thousand miles and a clear night in june

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

Right at you



I do whatever it takes

When I'm with you I get the shakes

My body aikes when I aint

With you I have zero strength

Theres no limit on how far I would go

No boundries no lengths

Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks

Gonna be that one and then once we get em its never the same



You want them when they dont want you

Soon as they do feelings change

Its not a contest and I aint on no conquest for no mate

I wasnt lookin but I stumbled onto you mustve been fate

But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take

Lets cut to the chase

But a door shuts in your face

Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open

That I wont be makin a mistake



I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

250 thousand miles and a clear night in june

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

Right at you



So after a year and 6 months its no longer me that you want

But I love you so much it hurts

Never mistreated you once

I poured my heart out to you

Let down my guard swear to god

Ill blow my brains in your lap

Lay here and die in your arms

Up to my knees and I'm bleedin



Im tryin to stop you from leavin

You wont even listen so fuck it

Im tryin to stop you from breathin

I put both hands on your throat

I sit on top of you squeezin

Til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick

Aint no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house



And let you live

Tears streamed down both of my cheeks

Then I let you just go and just give

And before I put that gun to my temple

I told you this



And I would do anything for you

To show you how much I adored you

But its over now

Its too late to save our love

Just promise me youll think of me everytime you look up in the sky and see a star cause imma



I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

250 thousand miles and a clear night in june

And I'm so lost without you

So lost without you

Without you

Without you"

I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



I'm just so fuckin depressed, 

I just can't seem to get out this slump

If I could just get over this hump, 

but I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps, 

fell down and I got right back up

But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 

in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when I ended up 

in this position I'm in

I'm startin to feel distant again, 

so I decided just to pick this pen



Up and try to make an attempt to vent 

but I just can't admit or come to grips

With the fact that I may be done with rap, 

I need a new outlet

And I know some shit so hard to swallow, 

but I just can't sit back and wallow

In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, 

I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow

I'll be one tough act to follow

Here today, gone tomorrow, 

but you'd have to walk a thousand miles...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



But don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



So don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, 

everythings so tense and gloom, I

Almost feel like I got to check the temperture 

of the room just as soon as

I walk in, it's like all eyes on me, 

so I try to avoid any eye contact

Cause if I do that, then it opens the door 

for coversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention, 

I just want to be just like you



Blend in with the rest of the room, 

maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fuckin man servant, 

tryna follow me around and wipe my ass

And laugh at every single joke 

I crack and half of them ain't even funny like

""Ahh, Marshall you're so funny man 

you should be a comedian, god damn""

Unfortunately I am, I just hide 

behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down, 

listen to the tale I'm about to tell

Hell, we ain't gotta trade our shoes, 

and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Nobody asked for life to deal us 

what these bullshit hands were dealt

We gotta take these cards ourselves, 

and flip them, don't expect no help

Now I could of either just sat on my ass 

and pissed and moaned

Or take this situation in which I'm placed, 

and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door 

and pack his bags

Or sat on the porch and hoped and pray 

for a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, 

every school I went

I dreamed of being that cool kid, 

even if it meant actin stupid



And Aunt Edna was told me, 

keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that

Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue 

tryna talk like ""thissss""

Till I stuck my tongue on that 

frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old

I learned my lesson then,

cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, 

not just based on my description

Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin, 

it's probably 110 percent different

I guess we would have to walk a mile 

in each others shoes at least

What size you wear? I wear 10's, 

let's see if you could fit your feet...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Lately I've been hard to reach

I've been too long on my own

Everybody has their private world

Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?

Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. 

Dad will be home soon. 

And to the rest of the world, 

God gave you them shoes, to fit you, 

so put them on and wear em. Be yourself man. 

Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny, 

don't ever let anyone tell you, you ain't beautiful."

That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)





I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek

Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey

Wanted to receive attention for my music

Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me

Been wanting my cake, And eat it too

And wanting it both ways

Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated

When I blew seep and it was confusing

Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam

Hit the lottery (oh wee)

With what I gave up to get was bittersweet

It was like winning a huge meet

Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink

I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep

Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith

But I'm actually weirder than you think

Cause I'm...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh

Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh





Now I ain't much of a poet

But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment

And don't squander it

Cause you never know when it could all be over

Tomorrow so I keep conjuring

Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from

(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way you're wandering?)

I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster

And save me from myself and all this conflict

Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it

My OCD is conking me in the head

Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking

I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying

Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh

Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh





Call me crazy, but I had this vision

One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian

But, until then,

drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at

Emcees, blood get spilled and I

Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track

Give every kid who got played at

Pumped the feeling

and shit to say back

To the kids who played 'em

I ain't here to save the fucking children

But if one kid out of a hundred million

Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great

It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back

In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that

Straw in the gold chump I will spend

Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack

Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts

I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that

It's nothing, I'm still friends with the...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



I'm friends with the monster

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for...
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,

The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:

Slim Shady!



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn

And we're starting this party from dusk



Ok... let's go



[Eminem:]

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk

Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust

Just one up my mothers son who got thrown under the bus

Kiss my butt. Lick from under cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks

It's a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.

Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.

Fist the cut. The lady give her eighty some paper cut.

Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought

Cause when I spit the verse the shit

Gets worse and worse cause your soft

If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time

Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.

I venture to say with the center of attention it's true

Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal

Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model.

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre



[Dr Dre:]

They see that low rider go by there, like Oh my!

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why.

I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.

I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.

Cause over and above all, it's just another day

And this one begins where the last one ends.

Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.

I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.

Driving around with a smashed front end

Let's cash that one in.

Grab another one from out the stable

The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado

The hell if I know.

Do I want leather seats or vinyl?

Decisions, decision

Garage looks like precision collision.

Or maico beats quake like Waco

Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model .

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

And there's really not that many of us.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent



[50 Cent:]

It's bottle after bottle

The money ain't a thang when you party with me

It's what we into it's simple

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe

I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm king kong

Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on

I'm so calm through vietnam ring the alarm

Bring the shaun dawn burn marajaun do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what

Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck

Blow it like it's suposed to be blown

Motherfucker I'm grown

If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain

So let the river run



He's coming home with his neck scratched to catch flack

Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch

On his breast jackets is sex addict

And she just wants to exact revenge and get back

It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack

She's kept track of all his internet chats

And guess who just so happens to be moving on to the next?

Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks

'Cause she loves danger, psychopath

And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that

But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back

Knife in hand, says the relationship's hanging by a strand

So she's been on the web lately

Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man

And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care

Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda' said ""Bye Suzanne"" after the first night, but tonight I am



I've been a liar, been a thief

Been a lover, been a cheat

All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me

A little one, I don't want to admit to something

If all it's gonna cause is pain

The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain

So let the river run



One night stand turned into night stayin'

It was cold, some lights gram, y'all be hung tight and

He found out, now she feels deserted and used

'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too

Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?

It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous and suited

When it's too hurt but what you deserve is the truth

Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you

So I revert to the studio like Hole In The Wall diners

Don't have to be reserved in a booth

I just feel like the person who I'm turnin' into is

Irreversible, I prayed on you like it's church at the pew

And now that I got you I don't want you

Took advantage of my thirst to pursue

Why do I do this dirt that I do?

Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon in speech

Detergent and bleach is burned in the womb

'Cause now with her in the womb

We can't bring her in this world, shoulda' knew

To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit

Fuck!



I've been a liar, been a thief

Been a lover, been a cheat

All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me

A little one, I don't want to admit to something

If all it's gonna cause is pain

The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain

So let the river run



My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)

Denver, river run

Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)

River (ooh), we'll let the river run



Always the bride's maid, never ""The bride, hey!""

Fuck can I say? If life was a highway

The sequels are non-clay

But be swerving in five lanes

Speeds that are high, rave like I'm sliding on ice maybe

That's what I made, that came at you sideways

I can't keep my lies straight, what I made

You terminate my baby

This love triangle

Left us in a wreck tangled

What else can I say? It was fun for a while

That I really woulda loved your smile

Didn't really wanna abort

But fuck it, what's one more lie to tell an unborn child?



I've been a liar, been a thief

Been a lover, been a cheat

All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me

A little one, I don't want to admit to something (I'm sorry, I fucked up) if all it's gonna cause is pain

The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain

So let the river run"

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

[Verse 1]

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared

I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there

From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends

It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, f*ck an acronym

Cut the f*cking act like you're happy, I'm f*cking back again

With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?

It ain't over 'til I say it's over  enough when I say enough

Throw me to the wolves and close the gate up

I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves

When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it

Weight is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie

Hold them b*tches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff

Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos

I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt



[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]

This is survival of the fittest

This is do or die

This is the winner takes it all

So take it all



[Verse 2]

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish

I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post

And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough

To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?

They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath

I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust

Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust

So floor's open if you'd like to discuss

Top 5 in this mothaf*cka and if I don't make the cut

What, like I give a f*ck, I'ma light this b*tch up like I'm driving a truck

To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it

Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up

And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut

And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook

Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself

With a f*cking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!

Cause I just sh*tted on the mic, and I like getting cut

I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut

Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win

Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait

Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting

Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut

It's survival of what?



[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]

This is survival of the fittest

This is do or die

This is the winner takes it all

So take it all



[Verse 3]

So get your ideas, stack your ammo

But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle

This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and sh*t

Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this

Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick

I don't do this music sh*t, I lose my sh*t

Ain't got sh*t to lose, it's the moment of truth

It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit

But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do

Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!

So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades

So you'd better trade your f*cking mics in for some tool-box-es

Cause you'll never take my pride from me

It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drivers

But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve

Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed

And if you don't like me then f*ck you!

Self es-teem must be f*cking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me

My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me

I can see why the f*ck I disgust you

I must be a-llergic to failure cause every time I come close to it

I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve!



[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]

This is do or die

This is the winner takes it all

But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?

Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price

Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way



To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit

I hold You nearest

My best friend, best friend

Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance

I can almost hear it

My best friend, best friend

When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit

Behold these lyrics

I got a best friend, best friend

Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah



I don't know much about Holy Bibles

But I grew up in the Bible Belt

I put my love for a woman on idle

Because I got beat with my mama's belt

But I learned from my mistakes

Try hard to respect people for what they believing in

But if you spit on my fucking grave

And wish me Hell then I wish you well

I'mma send you straight up to my best friend



To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit

I hold You nearest

God, please could you arm me with the armor

To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?

Could have gone the other way many times

Could have turned Dalai with the lama

But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent

Recently, but don't jinx it

It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though

Maybe not finna enter

The priesthood, but at least should

Make an attempt to show some remorse

And to be some sort of a repenter

For the people I've been a menace to

Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher

Into the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper

This patience of mine is thinner

Than twine is when I get attacked

So I might say something back that might offend you

So if you don't like when I rap

Or what I have to say on the mic then you

Might wanna act just like quarterbacks

And take a fuckin' hike when I snap cause I'm a sinner

(I got a best friend, best friend)

Plus balls and intestines

And they never been yes men

They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up

The minute I'm ever giving it less than

I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming

Cause failure's something I can barely stomach

And I only listen to my gut

So unless you're my fuckin' belly button

Don't tell me nothin'

You ain't my (best friend, best friend)

Who you think I'm talking 'bout?

Lifts me up when I'm down and out

Still look to him without a doubt

Still got a (best friend, best friend)

Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth

Should have never been allowed a mouth

Now that I got a higher power

Now when I blackout, power outage

They powerless, but they crowd around

They tend to flock like shepherds

The black sheep

But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard

When I'm counted out

You be D-O-A, they'll announce

But pronounce you dead when they sound it out

So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now

He's all around you

Not even the doctors at the hospital

Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life

It's im-piggy-possible to revive you

That's word to the diggy doc

Stiggy-stopping is not an option

Something I'm not gonna do

I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth

Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit

Talking to Proof dropping a deuce

Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock and I shoot

Who you think's my Glock that I use?

That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters

And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up

Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)



To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit

I hold You nearest

Here I am, alone again

Can't get out of this hole I'm in

It's like the walls are closin' in

You can't help me, no one can

I can feel these curtains closin'

I go to open 'em

But something pulls 'em closed again

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas

Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost

But I'd make you this small wager

If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper

Who would the odds favor?

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him

I keep pacin' this room, Valium and chase it with booze

One little taste, it'll do

Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger

If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka

Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)

That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a Benzo

I can hear the music continue to crescendo

I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window

That's when you know you're schizo (Hello darkness, my old friend)

'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel

The music is so loud

But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound

I should get ready for the show now

Wait is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact

Then something told me relax

And just hope for the show to be packed

Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max

'Cause that'd be totally wack

You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness, my old friend)

But what if nobody shows? Panic mode

'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second

'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance

Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions (Hello darkness, my old friend)

The press is about to go ape shit bananas on all the networks

Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers

I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed

Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser

Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the Scope

I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds

With them benzodiazepines gone

Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor

Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore



People start to show up, time to start the show up (Hello darkness, my old friend)

It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up

And I'm already sweatin' but I'm locked and loaded

For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers

Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere

As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel

Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze

Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner

With no prior convictions, so loss, the sky's the limit

So my supplies infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier

Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences

Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance

Guess show time is over

No suicide note, just a note for target distance

But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this

You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea

I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness

Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked

'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

When I close my eyes

Kings never die

I can hear the drummers drumming

And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming

But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit

And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was

Was it, too good to be true?

Have nothing, get it all but too much of it

Then lose it again, then I swallow hallucinogens

Cause if not, where the hell did it go?

Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven

Just choosing to sin

Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again

Do whatever I gotta do this to win

Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head

Crown around it, thorns on it

Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't

Think I'd be back, did ya?

How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog

But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at

I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate

But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt

Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count

Only time I ever been out and about is driving around town with my fucking whereabouts, in a doubt cause

I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter

Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up

Spit or shit or stepped on but kept going

I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong

Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?

Cause someone told me that

Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir

You ain't ever have to reach in the fire to dig deep

Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer

Wouldn't even take shit into consideration

Obliterate anyone in the way

I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me

But it'd actually have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire

Tell these new artists that kings never die

I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page, did just say I've been upstaged?

Why am I online? It's driving me crazy, I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge

Almost hot, but I'm not running kaboom, with a stage pass and this shit

And opinions sway, I can hear them say, if I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous

Comeback as if I went away, but detractors just say some bullshit for the Renegade

Someone's gonna make me blow my composure

Here I go again, to the stage and I feel like I'm in a cage

They so want a champion to fall

I still wonder why I laugh at 'em cause why carry when I'm all

So fuck what these cynics say

Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall

And I'm under attack again, I'll act as if I'm posted up

With this pented rage cause saw all these plaques in my office

On the floor stacked against the door

All be just metaphors for the odds of

When you comin' back again cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards

And trophies just don't mean jack anymore

Cause I'm here today and gone tomorrow

And I'm not gonna be



Here to stay

Even when I'm gone

When I close my eyes

Through the passage of time

Kings never die



I want it, I'm coming to get it, so you son of a bitches don't duck your gun and get rid of those

Critics all end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then

And I'm not stopping until I'm top again, all alone and on a throne

Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode, I've been on

Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone

And it's my time to go, but I'm still not leaving

Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told that I should go

Launch a Rover, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, cause



They say kings never die

Just ask Jam Master Jay

They just grow wings and they fly

So, hands up, reach for the sky

Try to hold up and provoke these moments

Cause in a blink of an eye

They'll be over



Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur

And ensure that nobody's ever gonna be what you were

So before you're leaving this Earth

You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berzerk

Deacon of words, syllable genius at work

Plus I'm think that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness, distill it with meanness

With some kind of back flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts

Secure us to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers

I made it to the silverscreen where Rocky stepped with the demons

Khalil on the beat cause making the beat ain't the same feeling to me is killing the beat

It's fulfilling to me, what filling a seat is

That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat

Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger

Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot

I swear that I won't let you down

I'mma be around forever, entertain even in the ground

You ain't ever gonna hear me say I ain't



Here to stay

Even when I'm gone

When I close my eyes

Through the passage of time

Oh, oh, oh

F-ckin' right I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic

Yeah, put the dick in their mouth, so I guess it's f-ck what they say

I'm high as a b-tch: up, up and away

Man, I'll come down in a couple of days

OK, you want me up in a cage ? 

Then I'll come out in beast mode

I got this world stuck in a safe, combination is the G-code

It's Weezy motha f-cka, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode

All about my dou' but I don't even check the peep-hole

So you can keep knockin' but won't knock me down

No love lost, no love found





[Eminem & Lil Wayne] Chorus :

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now

You kicked me when I was down

But what you say, just (don't hurt me)

That's right it (don't hurt me)

I don't need ya (no more) Don't wanna see ya (no more)

B-tch you get (no love)

You show me nothing but hate

You ran me into the ground

But what comes around goes around

I don't need you (don't hurt me)

You (don't hurt me no more)

That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you

You get no (love)

You showed me nothin' but hate, you ran me into the ground

But what comes arond goes arond (arond)

Don't hurt me (that's right)

You don't hurt me (and I don't need ya) 

No more (don't wanna see you)

No more, b-tch you get no love (no)

No love (no) no love (no) no love 

No more, b-tch you get no love (no)

No love (no) no love (no) no love ..

And I don't need ya (no more) ..





Eminem :

I'm alive again

More alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can 

See these people's ears perk up as I begin

To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most

Sh-t's finna to get thick again

They say the competition is stiff

But I get a hard dick from this sh-t, now stick it in

I ain't never givin' in again

Caution to the wind, complete freedom

Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em

So why the f-ck would I join 'em when I beat 'em ?

They call me a freak because

I like to spit on these p-ssies 'fore I eat 'em

Man get these wack cocksuckers off stage

Where the f-ck is Kanye when you need him ?

Snatch the mic from 'em, b-tch I'ma let you finish in a minute

Yeah that rap ws tight

But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time

So ya' might wanna go back to the lab tonight and, um

Scribble out them rhymes you were goinna spit

And start over from scratch and write new ones

But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference

When I rip the stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush you feel the bass thump

From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow

Set fire to the mic, and ignite the crowd

You can see the sparks from hot metal

Cold hearted from the day I Bogarted the game

My soul started to rot fellow

When I'm not even at my harshest

You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow

'Til I'm topplin' from the top I'm not goinna stop

I'm standin' on my Monopoly board

That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop

'Til my hip don't hop anymore

When you're so good that you can't say it 

Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore

People just get sick cause you spit these fools

Can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you could never break my stride

You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm 'bout to blow

You'll never take my pride 

I'm killin' the flow

Slow venom any opponent, it's gettin' no

Mercy mark my world 

Ain't lettin' up relentless, I smell blood

I don't give a f-ck

Keep givin' 'em hell

Where was you when I fell and needed help up ?

You get no love !





[Eminem & Lil Wayne] Chorus :

And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far



I went in headfirst

Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse

My mom probably got it the worst

The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are

Did I take it too far?

Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs

But regardless I don't hate you cause ma!

You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom

Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam

Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb

Equivalent to Chemical warfare

And forever we can drag this on and on

But, agree to disagree

That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me

You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve

(little prick just leave) ma, let me grab my fucking coat

Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats?

Especially when dad, he fucked us both

We're in the same fucking boat

You'd think that it'd make us close (nope)

Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine

A car full of belongings

Still got a ways to go, back

To grandma's

House it's straight up the road

And I was the man of the house, the oldest

So my shoulders carried the weight

Of the load

Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and

That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable

And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far



Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though

Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth

But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry

Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause

Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes

That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio

And I think of Nathan being placed in a home

And all the medicine you fed us

And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but

Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow

And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though

But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo

All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both

Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours

But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause

One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was

Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address

But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus

Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas

Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's

If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them

And although one has met their grandma

Once you pulled up in our drive one nights

As we were leaving to get some hamburgers

Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you

And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me

As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and

I saw your headlights as I looked back

And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad

So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet

I guess I had to get this off my chest

I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead

The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing

So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message

That I'll always love you from afar, cause you're my mama...



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far



I want a new life, one without a cause

So I'm coming home tonight, well, no matter what the cost

And if the plane goes down, and if the crew can't wake me up

Just know that I was alright, and I was not afraid to die

Even if there's songs to sing, my children will carry me

Just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die

Because I put my faith in my new girl, so I never say goodbye cruel world

Just know that I'm alright, I am not afraid to die 



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life"

You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd fuck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work

You're still a cunt

I'm still a fucking jerk

Same as it ever was, yeah

Say it'll change but it never does

Ain't gonna ever 'cause

You're the cause of my pain and the medicine

Never met someone who played games with my head as much

Fate tethered us together like two felons

Must've fell in love with skeletons

Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but

Feels like I slept with the wicked stepmother

But how the hell am I

Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of

They say love the one you quit

But this shit is killing us

I lust on some other shit

I'm a glutton for punishment

You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts

It's above and beyond us

Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven

If I catch you sucking another dick

You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again

Why am I tucking you in?

Probably 'cause



I gotta tell myself another lie

'Cause that's what helps to get me by

'Cause I'm in Hell

This is my goodbye, farewell



Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you

Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you

Wanna heal you, yeah

Wanna lose you, keep you bruised

You be the abuse you treat, you mutual

It's juvenile, delusional, it's usual

You're beautiful, I'm average

I'm brutal, you're a savage

My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising

Yeah it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick

Though we might get along like shit

Fight, hit, fight, spit, unite, split

Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine

And they say love is blind, we see each other fine

But it's no wonder, I'm the only one you'll find

To put up with your shit, I need a plumber line (Yeah)

But nothing comes to mind besides a number 90

'Cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down

Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now

Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows, make it rain upwards

We're on the ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds

I should fly south, 'cause man am I great and land in myself

But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm outtie five thou'

But this is my house, bitch you get out

Then we duke it out, then it dies down

Then we say, ""Fuck it"", cry our eyes out

Then...



I gotta tell myself another lie

'Cause that's what helps to get me by

'Cause I'm in Hell

This is my goodbye, farewell



This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be

Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts

'Cause that's what attracts us

Trick you with a back rub

Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub

Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic

But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us

I love you but I won't exchange vows

Hey now, don't get carried away

No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wet us

Yeah, but we're so insane about each other

May take the same route and way out as junior stay out

Break out Berettas lay down in bed and blow our brains out together

Who knows how it's gonna play out?

A weathered desk where our ending would be

One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee

But I go to bat for you, defending your honor

Yeah, no contingency fees, something will not knock

We're not pretending to be, don't cost a penny to be with me

Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke

Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing

Could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine

Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea

Guess I'm a prisoner see, addiction is a disease



I gotta tell myself another lie

'Cause that's what helps to get me by

'Cause I'm in Hell

This is my goodbye, farewell



Love you girl, do you feel the same?

I don't wanna play games, no games, ahh

You're the only that can out my flame

Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ahh"

hahaha 
We love you 


How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours? 

The stripes and the stars for the rights of men who have died for the protect?

The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedem of speech the United States Government has sworn to uphold





Yo, I want everyone to listen to the words of this song 



Or so we're told... 



Verse #1

I never woulda dreamed in a million years id see 

so many mutha fuckin people who feel like me 

Who share the same views 

And the same exact beliefs 

Its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me 

So many lives i touched 

So much anger aimed at no perticular direction 

Just sprays and sprays 

Straight through your radio wavs 

It plays and plays 

Till it stays stuck in your head 

For days and days 

who woulda thought standin in this mirror 

Bleachin my hair wit some Peroxide 

Reachin for a T shirt to wear 

That i would catipult to the fore-front of rap like this 

How can i predict my words 

And have an impact like this 

I musta struck a chord wit somebody up in the office 

Cuz congress keeps tellin me 

I aint causin nuttin but problems 

And now they sayin im in trouble wit the government 

Im lovin it

I shovelled shit all my life 

And now im dumpin it on 



Chorus

WHITE AMERICA 

I could be one of ur kids 

WHITE AMERICA 

Little erik looks just like this 

WHITE AMERICA 

Erica loves my shit 

I got to TRL 

Look how many hugs i get 



Verse #2

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like urself 

If they were brown 

Shady knew shady sits on the shelf 

But Shadys cute 

Shady knew Shady's dimples would help 

Make ladies swoon baby 

(ooo baby) 

Look at myself! 

Lets do the math 

If i was black i woulda sold half 

I aint have to graduate 

From Lincoln High School to know that 

But i can rap so fuck school 

Im too cool to go back 

Gimme the mic 

Show me where the fuckin studio's at 

When i was underground 

No one gave a fuck i was white 

No lables wanted to sign me 

Almost gave up, i was like ""Fuck it"" 

Until i met Dre 

The only one who looked past 

Gave me a chance 

And i lit a fire up under his ass 

Helped him get back to the top 

Every fan black that i got 

Was probly his 

In exchange for every white fan that he's got 

Like damn we just swapped 

Sittin back look at this shit wow 

Im like ""Does this skin work for my benifit now?"" 



Chorus 



Verse #3

See the problem is i speak to suberban kids 

Who otherwise 

Woulda never knew these words exist 

These moms probly woulda never gave 2 squirts of piss

Till i created so much mutha fuckin turbulence

Straight out the tube right into ya livin rooms i came 

And kids Flipped

When they found out i was produced by Dre 

Thats all it took 

And they were instantly hooked right in 

And they connected wit me too cuz i looked like them

Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope 

Searchin wit a fine toothed comb 

Its like this rope waitin to choke 

Tightenin around my throat 

Watchin me while i write this like ""I dont like this, NO!"" 

All i hear is 

Lyrics lyrics constant controversy 

Sponsors workin round the clock 

To try to stop my concerts early 

Surely hip hop is never a problem 

In Harlem only In Boston 

After it bothered ya fathers 

of daughters startin to blossom 

Now im catchin the flack from these activists 

When they raggin 

Actin like im the 1st rapper to smack a bitch and say faggot 

Shit 

Just look at me like im ya closest pal 

A poster child 

the mutha fuckin spokesman now! 



Chorus



Outro

So to the parents of America

I am the damager aimed at little Erica

To attack her character

The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns

Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress

And piss on the lawns of the whitehouse

To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker

To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hipocracy

Fuck you Ms Cheeney

Fuck you Tipper Gore

Fuck you with the free-este of space this divided state of embarrasment will allow me to have

Fuck You

His name is (Marshall!)

You wouldn't want to be

Anywhere else in the world right now

So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)



You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest

Most rawest form, flow almost flawless

Most hardest, most honest known artist

Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)

Looks like Batman brought his own Robin

Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden

With his own private plane, his own pilot

Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges

Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes

Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches

Away from you, dear, fear none

Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so



Let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

Let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)



Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles

Gee willikers Dre, ""Holy bat syllables!""

Look at all the bullshit that goes on

In Gotham when I'm gone

Time to get rid of these rap criminals

So skip to your lou while I do what I do best

You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it

Flows too wet, nobody close to it

Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit

The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much

They make it all up, there's no such thing

Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans

It just means so much more to so much more

People when you're rappin' and you know what for

The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all

To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!



Now let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)



It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo

Two old friends, why panic? You already know

Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes

Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero

You can even call collect, the most feared duet

Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette

And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat

People steppin' over people just to rush to the set

Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely

Ease over these beats and be so breezy

Jesus, how can shit be so easy?

How can one Chandra be so Levy?

Turn on these beats, MC's don't see me

Believe me, BET and MTV

Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy

Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me

'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear

Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here

But we ain't fuckin' around round here

Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a ""hell yeah""? (Hell yeah!)



Now let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

Let's get down to business

So there you have it, folks

(Marshall!) has come to save the day

Back with his friend Andre

Here to remind you that bullshit does not pay

Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay

And never go away, until our dying day

Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)

So until next time, friends

Same blonde hair, same rap channel

Good night, everyone! Thank you for coming!

Your host for the evening (Marshall!)

against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,

give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the

evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but

they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,

i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...

I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm

cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I

never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...



I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me

inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a

multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father

must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,

no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I

couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it

work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm

man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest

shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot

Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you

think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'

your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'

through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of

Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew

up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made

that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your

gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna

know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but

you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't

admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare

you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in

hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess

what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

I'm back now and i've come to release this info

I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple

Cannabitch, don't want no beef with slim, NOO!

Not even on my radar

So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off

and follow me cos i put these crayons to chaos

from seance to seance. 



Chorus 2x:

So come on down

So get on down

Doh si doh now

Dont have a good plan

Dont be scerrrd (scared), cuz therrr (there) ain't nuttin' to werrr (worry) 'bout

Let your hair down

Square dance 



Verse #2:

Let your hair down to the track, yeh, keep goin back (BOO!)

The boogie-monster of rap, yeh, the man's back!

With a plan to ambush this bush administration

Moosh the senate's facin', push this generation

O' kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'

You might not like, this white hot light that im under

No wonder i look so sunburnt,

Oh no, i won't leave no stone unturned

Oh no, i won't leave one goin' nowhere

Doh-si-soh oh! yo! ho! hello there!

Oh yeh! don't think i won't go there

Go to beyreuth and do a show there

Yeh you laugh til your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted

When you're in bed here thinkin' the draft cant happen

'Til you fuck around gettin anthrax napkin

Inside a package wrapped in sarandrap wrappin'

Open the plastic, and then you stand back gaspin'

Fuckin' assassins hijackin' anthrax crashin'

All this terror, america demands action

Next thing you know, you've got uncle sam's ass askin'

To join our army, or what you do for their navy

You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18

You're on a plane now eatin' that food and that baked beans

I'm 28, they gon take you 'fore they take me

Crazy insane or insane crazy?

When i say hussein, you say shady!

My views ain't changed to lean humane way for

Rain 2 days late, the date's today

Hey team! 



Chorus 2x:





Verse #3

Nothing moves me more than a groove that suits me

Nothing suits me more than a groove that boosts me

Nothing boosts me more or suites me beautifully

There's nothing you can do to me, stab me, shoot me

Physcotic hypnotic product I gotta take antibotic

Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada

Gotta talk alot of hum-hei-la-da-da-der

Oochie walla-walla-mmm-de-da-da but you gotta gotta

Keep moving there's more music to make

Keep making new shit, produce hits to break

The monotony whats gotten into me?

Drugs, rock and hennesey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies

On your knees, got you under siege

Somebody you would give a lung to be

Hungry like a fucking younger me

Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free

Yeah, buddy, laugh is funny, I have the money

To have you killed by somebody who has nothing

I pass bluffing, pass the K, while 

Lets get ready for some intense serious ass whooping 



Chorus 2x

Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns, 
never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one,
and got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin', 
took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin', 

willin' to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant life or death, 

never live to regret what I said, 

when you're me, people just want to see, 

if it's true, if it's you, what you say in your rap's, what you do, 

so they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill, 

when they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real, 

in confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation, 

any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it, 

if you conceal it, reveal it, being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, 

pull it, squeeze it, till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies, 

I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze...



[Chorus:]

I'm a soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much, they won't budge, 

i'll never fall or fold up,

i'm a soldier, 

even if my collar bone's crush or crumble, 

I will never slip or stumble, 

i'm a soldier, 

these shoulder's hold up so much, they won't budge, 

i'll never fall or fold up, 

i'm a soldier, 

even if my collar bone's crush or crumble, 

I will never stumble...



I love pissin' you off, it get's me off, 

like my lawyer's, when the fuckin' judge let's me off,

all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off, 

i'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bet's be off, 

i'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitche, it's news, 

pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers, six-two, 

who needs bullets, soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets, 

an excellent method to get rid of the next bully, 

it's actually better cause instead you murderin', 

you can hurt em' and come back again and kick dirt at 'em, 

it's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued, 

you can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room, 

everybody halts and stops, calls the cops,

all you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops, 

runnin' and duckin' out the Hard Rocks parking lot, 

you'll all get shot whether its your fault or not, cause...



[Chorus]



I spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin' to 'em, 

give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em, 

i'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence, 

I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it, 

you motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it, 

don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it, 

don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest, 

I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch, 

so ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock, 

listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock, 

listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen, 

motherfuckers know that i'll never be Marshall again, 

full of controversy until I retire my jersey, 

'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty, and

Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me, 

and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, i'm a...

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
{Hollywood}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

{Why do I feel this way}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood



[Verse 1]

I thought I had it all figured out, I did

I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim

But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once

I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs

Which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave

How come I couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me

Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt

Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell, to catch me

The minute shit was heated she just bailed

i'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself

I couldn't even see the millimetere when it fell

Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt

Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground

I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail

I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female

I need to slow down

Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now i'm...



[CHORUS]



[Verse 2]

Bury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look

At nothin', this world's too much

I've swallowed all I could

If I could swallow a bottle of tylenol I would, and end it for good

Just say goodbye to Hollywood

I probably should, these problems are piling all at once

Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up

I think i'm bottomin' out

But i'm not about to give up, I gotta get up

Thank God, I got a little girl

And I'm a responsible father

So not a lot of good, i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud

Must be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it

All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps of my dad

Cause I hate him so bad

The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man

If you could understand why I am the way that I am

What do I say to my fans, when I tell 'em i'm...



[CHORUS]



[Verse 3]

I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it

For me to have this much appeal like this is sick

This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick

Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick

Fuck the guns, i'm done, i'll never look at gats

If I scrap, i'll scrap like I ain't never whooped some ass

I love my fans

But no one ever puts a grasp on the fact i've sacrificed everything I have

I never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at, this is whack

This is more than I ever could of asked

everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask

What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that

It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, i'm trapped

If I could go back, I never woulda rapped

I sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back

I just wanna leave this game with level head intact

Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein',

everything blow up and all you did was just grow

up emceeing

It's fuckin' crazy

Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had

But instead I forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin'...



[CHORUS]



[Outro]

Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood, {Goodbye},

please don't cry for me, when i'm gone for good, {this shit is not for me},

so goodbye, goodbye Hollywood,

{i'm not a fuckin' star}, please don't cry

for me, when I'm gone for good, {i'm goin' back home}..."

That's why I ain't got no time, for these games and stupid tricks, all these bitches on my dick,

that's how dudes be getting sick, that's how dicks be getting drips, falling victims to this

shit, from these bitches on our dicks, fucking chickens with no ribs, that's why I ain't got no

time...



[Obie Trice]

Yo', I woke up fucked up off the liquor I drunk, I had a bag of the skunk won in last nights

tunk, pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaners, fucked me good, you should of

seen this, big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french roll stylin', body like a stallion, sizin'

up the figure while my shit getting bigger, debatin' on a fuck or do I want to be her nigga,

caressin' this bitch, plus i'm checking out them tit's, sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used

to buyin', I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory, like takin' hoe's money, but that's

another story, for surely, the pussy on toast after we toast, her clothes fell like bishop in

juice, the womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock in that spot hotter than the

hottest block, don't stop, the response I got when I was knockin' it, clock steady tickin',

kinky finger lickin', and can on, semen's at my tip when she moans, I gotta slow down before I

cum soon, and work that nigga, like a slave owner, when I dropped off my outfit, she knew I

wanted to bone her, she foamin' at the lips, the one between them hips, pubic hairs lookin' like

some sour cream dip, without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though, pussy tighter than

conditions of us black folks, we in the final stretch, the last part of sex, I bust a fat ass

nut, then I woke up next, like what the fuck is goin' on here, this bitch evaporated, pussy and

all, just picked up and vacated, now i'm frusturated cause my dick was unprotected, and Doctor

Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit...



[CHORUS]



[Eminem]

Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin', someone better get this bitch,

before she get's kicked in the stomach, and she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me

to throw her off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force and I don't wanna resort to

any violence of any sort, but what's she shovin' me for, doesn't she love me no more, wasn't she

huggin' me four minutes ago at the door, man, i'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this

whore, what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce, she's havin' another baby

in a month, and it's yours, and you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visitin' someone

else, and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back, to Michigan, now the

plot is thickenin' worse, cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a

hearse, so you paranoid at every little cold that you get, ever since they told you this shit,

you've been holdin' your dick, so you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it, then

the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace, and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby

it's AIDS, he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it, so you jet back home, cause you

gon' get that hoe, when you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo', cause you love

her, you never would expect that blow, Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low,

Jesus, I don't believe this, bitch works at the cleaners, bringin' me home diseases, swingin'

from Obie's penis, she's so deceivin', shit this hoe's a genius, she g'd us...

Guess who's back, back again

Shady's back, tell a friend

Guess who's back, guess who's back

Guess who's back, guess who's back



I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to

See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver

Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker

Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital

By the doctor when I'm not co-operating

When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)

You waited this long, now stop debating

‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating

I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney

But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be

Or let me be me, so let me see

They try to shut me down on MTV

But it feels so empty without me

So, come on and dip, bum on your lips

Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits

And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy

I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!



Now this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me



Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious

Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis

They start feeling like prisoners helpless

'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!!!""

A visionary, vision is scary

Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves

A rebel, so just let me revel and bask

In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​

And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe

For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?

Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna

Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter

The center of attention, back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling

Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting

Testing, attention please

Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me

Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free

A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?



Now this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me



A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with

Anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""

Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie

You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!

You don't know me, you're too old, let go

It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal

I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults

I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems

Everybody only wants to discuss me

So this must mean I'm disgusting

But it's just me, I'm just obscene

No, I'm not the first king of controversy

I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley

To do black music so selfishly

And use it to get myself wealthy

(Heyyy!) There's a concept that works

Twenty million other white rappers emerge

But no matter how many fish in the sea

It'll be so empty without me



Now this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me

Listen, Joel just called me and he said you're in the fucking back behind his studio,
shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range.
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around, like an idiot, outside of your home.
You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
Don't bring your gun outside of your home you can't carry it on you.

Leave your fuckin gun at home"

Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care

He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out

When he talks about, his fucking dad walking out

Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out

If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out

His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back

Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stocking cap

His step-father hit him so he socked him back

And broke his nose, his house is a broken home

There's no control, he just lets his emotions go



Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)

Sing it with me, just for today

Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away



Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters

In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum

Holy or unholy, only have one homie

Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate

I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great

Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate

It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum

Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?

From standing on corners and porches just rapping

To having a fortune, no more kissing ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you

Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you

To get they hands on every dime you have

They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon

Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns

That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me

Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

But all their kids been listening to me religiously

So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me

They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me

If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal

Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?

I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to

You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you



Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing this shit!)

Sing it with me, just for today

Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away



They say music can alter moods and talk to you

Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?

Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude

Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols

And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool

Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves

We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales

You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self

We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail

It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing

To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted

That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing

Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine

Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long

Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs

Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives

So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die

'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe

We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes

That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it

Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden

And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone

Just let our spirits live on

Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can



Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)

Sing it with me, just for today

Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)

Sing it with me, just for today

Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away"

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase

I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face

Play no games, say no names

Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face

I'm a different man, kiss my ass

Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?

Kiss my dick, get my cash?

I'd rather have you whip my ass

Don't put out, I'll put you out

Won't get out, I'll push you out

Puss blew out, poppin' shit

Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

Am I too nice? Buy you ice?

Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life

What, you tryin' to be my new wife?

What, you Mariah? Fly through twice



But I do know one thing though

Bitches, they come, they go

Saturday through Sunday, Monday

Monday through Sunday, yo

Maybe I'll love you one day

Maybe we'll someday grow

'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes

It's no secret, everybody knows

Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?

That's about as far as your buddy goes

We'll be friends, I'll call you again

I'll chase you around every bar you attend

Never know what kinda car I be in

We'll see how much you be partyin' then

You don't want that, neither do I

I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys

Too much pride, between you and I

Not a jealous man, but females lie

But I guess that's just what sluts do

How could it ever be just us two?

I'd never love you enough to trust you

We just met and I just fucked you

I don't see what the big deal is anyway

You're just plain old Marshall to me)

Ooh yeah, girl, run that game

(Hailie Jade, I love that name

Love that tattoo, what's that say?

""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great)

First off, you don't know Marshall

At all, so don't grow partial

That's ammo for my arsenal

I'll slap you off that bar stool

There goes another lawsuit

Leave handprints all across you

Good Lordy, whoadie

You must be gone off that water bottle

You want what you can't have

Ooh girl, that's too damn bad

Don't touch what you can't grab

End up with two backhands

Put anthrax on a Tampax

And slap you 'til you can't stand

Girl, you just blew your chance

Don't mean to ruin your plans



But I do know one thing though

I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back

Yo, check it out



Some days I sit starin' out the window

Watchin' this world pass me by

Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for

I almost break down and cry

Sometimes I think I'm crazy

I'm crazy? Oh, so crazy

Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?

But then I see my baby

Suddenly I'm not crazy

It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no



Cause sometimes it feels

Like the world's on my shoulders

Everyone's leanin' on me

Cause sometimes it feels

Like the world's almost over

But then she comes back to me



My baby girl keeps gettin' older

I watch her grow up with pride

People make jokes cause they don't understand me

They just don't see my real side

I act like shit don't faze me

Inside it drives me crazy

My insecurities could eat me alive

But then I see my baby

Suddenly I'm not crazy

It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no



Cause sometimes it feels

Like the world's on my shoulders

Everyone's leanin' on me

Cause sometimes it feels

Like the world's almost over

But then she comes back to me



Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter

If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father

To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her

God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *want her*

Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona

That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his mama

But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest

Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled

That hurts deep inside of my soul

And just know that I grow colder the older I grow

This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold

And this load is like the weight of the world

And I think my neck is breakin'

Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?

Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself

But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell

But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt

So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else

But the years that I've wasted

Is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted

So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation

I've went to jail for this woman

I've been to bat for this woman

I've taken bats to people's backs

Bent over backwards for this woman

Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?

Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up

If I'd have seen what she was fuckin', but fuck it

It's over, there's no more reason to cry no more

I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie

So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya

Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner

And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted

It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted



And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders

Everyone's leanin' on me

Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier

Nothin' can take her from me



Wooo! Told you I can't sing

Oh well, I tried

Hailie, remember when I said

If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?

Guess what, Daddy's here

And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby

I love you (??*smooch*)??"

But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Sike!
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love

Or would it matter

Can never be the lead-off batter of things

Shit for me to feed off

I'm see-saw battlin

But theres way too much at stake for me to be fake

There's too much on my plate

And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away

And not say what I got to say

What the fuck you take me for? a joke? you smokin crack?

Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back

I get up 'for i get down, run myself in the ground, 'for I put some wack shit out

I'm tryin-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark

Ya'll steady tryin to drown the shark

Ain't gonna do nothin but piss me off

Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off

See me leap out, pull the piece out, fuck shootin i'm just trying to knock his teeth out

Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle

Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap

Yo slim, you gonna let him get away with that?

He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that

Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,

This is crazy the way we act

When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops



There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh

If so you woulda tried

The only way I'm leavin this bitch is suicide

I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with hennesy,

Got drunk then I finished he

I'm every nigga's favorite arch-enemy.

Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef

I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark dilligently

I'm not what you think

I appear to be fucked up

Mentally endangered

I can't stay away from a razor

I just want my face in a paper

I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres

I murder you

Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of sam, bitch, I'm surgical

I'l allergic to dyin, you think not? you got balls? We can see how large

When the music stops



I was happy having a deal at first,

Thought money would make me happy but

It only made my pain worst,

It hurts when u see ur friends turn their back on u dawg

When u ain't got nothing left but ur word and ur balls

And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends

Beggin' with they hands out

Checking for ur record when its selling

When it aint, that's the end, no laughs

No friends no girl

Just the gin u drink till u car spin u then

[Screech]

Damn!

[Crash]

U slam into the wall and u fall

Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm

About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol

If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops



Let's see how many of your men loyal,

When i pull up looking for you,

With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil

I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust ur head would just explode

With red stuff i'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon

Braggin about how u shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you

Niggars, if i was u niggas, i'll run while given the chance

Understand i can enchance the spirit of man

Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really

Irks me, u ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk

Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark

Hug the floor while we plan to the war with ur life, fuck the tour and the mic

I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like

You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga ur a gonna at night



When The Music Stops



Instigators, turn pits in cages

Let loose and bit the neighbours

wrist to razors

Ya'll don't want war, you want talk

In the dark my dogs all bark like woof

Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof

Caved in like reindeer hoofs

Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose

The more ya'll breach, the more I moves

This hill street, this is hardcore blues

Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)

Or make the news betcha all ya'll move

When the uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop



Music's changed my life in so many ways

Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade

LL told me to rock the bells

NWA said fuck the police

Now i'm in jail

93 was strictly R&B

Fucked up hair cut

Listen to Jodeci

Michael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike

Ass cheeks painted white

Fucking Presilla at night

Flying down sunset smoking crack

Transvestite in the front

Eddi Murphy in the back

MOP had me grindy and griddy

Marilyn Manson, i dyed my hair blue

And grew some titties

Ludacris told me to throw them bowls

Now i'm in the hospital

Broken nose and a fractured elbow

Voices in my head, i'm going in shock,

I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops

Huh, so I'm out the game huh?
[Eminem]

Yo Dre, we ridin?



[Dr. Dre]

Whatever



[Eminem]

Well I'm witchu homie



[Dr. Dre]

Ok, Let's handle this small shit



[Eminem]

I was born to brew up storms 'n stir up shit

Kick up dust, cuss til I slur up spit

Grew up too quick, won't through too much, through too much shit

Corrupt and I'm pour it on like syrup, bitch

Thick in gritz, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth

Dre tole me to milk this shit for what it's worth

Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth

And if I fumble the verse, keep going

First take, I make mistakes, just keep it

No punches, pull no punches, that's weak shit

Fake shit if I ever take shit, I eat shit

Wasn't for him? I wouldn't be shit



[Dr. Dre]

Creep wit me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane

Been here longer than anyone in the game

And I ain't got to lie about my age



[Eminem]

But what about Jermaine?



[Dr. Dre]

Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin mine or Timbaland's name

And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your sayin

I'ma giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked

When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it

Ya midget, Mini-Me, with a buncha little Mini-You's

Runnin around your backyard swimming pools

Over 80 million records sold

And I ain't had to do it with 10 or 11 year olds



[Chorus:]

Cuz what you say is what you say

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?



Cuz what you say is what you say

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?



[Eminem]

Second verse, it gets worst

It gets no better than this

Amatuers drink veteran piss

From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up

Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri

Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you

Blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucken again

Dre ain't havin it as long as Im here, play Devil's Advocate



[Dr. Dre]

If there was some magic shit I could wave

Over the indusrty that could save it when I'm gone

And bury to make sure the tradition carries on

I would



[Eminem]

If I could only use this power for good

I wouldn't, not even if I could



[Dr. Dre]

From the hood and I'm a hornet

And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered



[Eminem]

And I'ma only sucker punch or swing without warnin

And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off

Cuz I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off

Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk

Don't give a fuck, white Pac, so much spunk

When I was little I knew I would blow up

And sell a mil or grow up to be a tiller

Go nuts and be a killer



[Dr. Dre]

And I'm somethin of a phenom

One puff of the chron

I'm unstoppable, I'm alive, I'm on top again

There's no obstacle that I can't conquer

So come along with us (Come On)



[Chorus:]

Cuz what you say is what you say

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?



Cuz what you say is what you say

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?



[Dr. Dre]

Now anybody who knows Dre

Knows I'm about fast cars and alize, partyin all day

But I handle my business cuz it's work before play

Don't look for trouble but I serve you gourmet

However you want it, you could have it your way

You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day

Bullet with your name, sendin it your way

That goes for anyone who walks thru that doorway

Cuz this is my space, you invade it

Live to regret it and you die tryin to violate it

Fuck around and you'll get anahilated

Eyes diliated



[Eminem]

Ha, like my old lady

Cuz what you say is what you say

Sometimes what you mean is 2 different things

Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things

Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything

Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back

I speed write and my loose leaves my lanch pad



[Dr. Dre]

And I can pull any string

Don't have to prove anything

Catch a contract on your head

You headed West, talk shit about Dre?

You better get a vest, then invest in something

To protect your head and neck



[Eminem]

And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth

I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth

But a lot of truth is said injest

And if I ever do live to be a legend

I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source

Ain't holdin' my fuckin breath

But I suffocate for the respect

Fore I breath the collect the fuckin check



[Chorus:]

Cuz what you say is what you say

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?



Cuz what you say is what you say

5kgYeVd1ya275wfmxvB0Su,Till I Collapse,6EzbFdrwvWpnpUjzrR57aU,The Eminem Show (Expanded Edition),7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR,"Eminem, Nate Dogg",297786,,2022,"Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, and gotta find that inner strength, and just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse

Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em

Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em

Cause when I am not, then I'mma stop penning 'em

And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem

Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?

Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom

Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop

Amoxicillin's just not real enough

The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain

A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners

You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it

Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us

You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock

Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?

Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up

You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck



Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse



Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get

When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit

This is your moment, and every single minute you spend

Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again

So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can

And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end

Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in

I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in

It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie

Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me

But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy

So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me

That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me

Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me

You hate it but you know respect you got to give me

The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me



Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse



Soon as a verse starts I eat at an emcee's heart

What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart

And it's absurd how people hang on every word

I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve

But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved

If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first

Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse

That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse

My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict

I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers

But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles

The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers

So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em

The track is on some battling raps, who want some static?

Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters

A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

So...



Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse



Until the roof (until the roof)

The roof comes off (the roof comes off)

Until my legs (until my legs)

Give out from (underneath me)

I will not fall, I will stand tall

Feels like no one can beat me"

There's no tower too high

No plane that I can't learn how to fly

What do I gotta do to get through to you

To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?

(Rahhnnn!)

Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls

I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar

Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses

With Elton John's name on my drag wall

I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off

All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off

So tell Laura and her husband to back off

'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off

And goddamn it, you little motherfucker

If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!

 Uh Fuck that shit, bitch!

Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick

And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second

I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch

Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face, with a clit

Ring in my nose than quit bringin' my flows

Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?

If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.

I wouldn't have to go eenee-meene-minie-moe

Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more

Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more? (Dad!)



There's really nothin' else to say

I can't explain it

I think my dad's gone crazy!

A little help from Hailie Jade

Won't you tell 'em, baby?

I think my dad's gone crazy!

There's nothin' you could do or say

That could ever change me

I think my dad's gone crazy!

There's no one on Earth that can save me

Not even Hailie

I think my dad's gone crazy!



My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise

At the same time, can make you dry your eyes

With the same rhyme

See, what you're seein' is a genius at work

Which to me isn't work

So it's easy to misinterpret it at first

Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek

I'd yank my fuckin' teeth

Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums

Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once

And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son

And walk around the rest of my life spit on

And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung

Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on

More pain inside of my brain

Than the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane

Aimed at the World Trade

Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky

'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade

And that's pretty much the gist of it

The parents are pissed, but the kids love it

9 millimeter heaters stashed

In two-seaters with meat cleavers

I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither



There's really nothin' else to say

I can't explain it

I think my dad's gone crazy!

A little help from Hailie Jade

Won't you tell 'em, baby?

I think my dad's gone crazy!

There's nothin' you could do or say

That could ever change me

I think my dad's gone crazy!

There's no one on Earth that can save me

Not even Hailie

I think my dad's gone crazy!

Crazy!



Ha ha ha ha!

You're funny, Daddy!"

Psst..
Hey, Listen
I love my job

It makes me feel like... superman

Can you fly?

I can

Wanna see?



[Chorus]

I'm only entertaining you why

Going to stimulate making you high

And take you and I, to a place that you can't see

But I believe you can fly

I don't need nobody home I'm just partying

I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian

Just a man whos on the mic, so let me... entertain you



[Verse 1]

My lyrical content is constantly undefined

No wonder why I constantly bomb back

To come back attacks with constant concepts

From lyrics constantly took out of context

Failure to communicate with congresses

Been a problem for the longest I guess but

Maybe one day we can make some progress

Food for thought see how long it takes to digest

Feeling good when I should be ashamed

Shit, I really should've fell when I stood

See I came like a flame in the night

Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light

There's a hope there's a spark

But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye

Until they decide to set the differences aside

And this is why only one of us will survive

So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because



[Chorus x1]



[Verse 2]

My music can be slightly amusing

You shouldn't take lyrics so serious

It might be confusing

Trying to seperate the truth from entertainment

It's stupid ain't it?

I get sick of trying to explain it

See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond

Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde

Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone

Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on

Constantly movin' constantly using the constitution

As a form of restitution

Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant

Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams

I'll be here when y'all are gone re-building

We're all revolving, still evolving, still Slim

How many kids will cop me?

Probably millions

But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then...



[Chorus X1]



[Verse 3]

My lyrical content contains subject matter

That sucks up all these fucked up young kids

Out of a long and great common denominate

Add it up and you'll see thats why I dominate

I try to stimulate but kids imulate

And mimmick ever move you make

""Slim you're great""

But wait, can't you see im only here to entertain?

I gotta be the one to go against the grain

Cuz man, I see it, feel it, live it

But its inhumane for me to see you be influenced

And pretend you ain't

But they don't understand that i've been through pain

If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain

But you can't just stand there and try to touch

It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much

And its such a pleasure every button that I touch

I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust

But i'm

We back! Invasion, Part 2

You should find something to do with your time (time)

And it must be fuckin' with you so much you must be goin' out your mind (mind)

They say i'm a damn way from my entire empire crumbilin'

Speak up your mumbillin'

What the fuck are you so (be,be,be,be,k,k,k,k) okay baby this is Shady I know you is a lil baby and wish we would just go away and we may weeble wobble but we don't fall down like J master J's two turn tables(R.I.P.)our label is just too stable

Your magazine is so mutha fuckin' thin you usin' staples to hold it together 

It's turnin' back into a news paper

And y'all got someting for my ass every issue

Thank you cause I keep runin outta fuckin' tissue

And not to diss you but god I was sick of lookin' at you

Atleast I can know when nikes' got a new tennis shoe

But I guess no g'news is always good g'news 

Movin' on to big, better things (Chickachickacheureh)

50's blowin' up 

Missy keeps on throwin' up

What the fuck is goin' on?

Who the fuck is Norah Jones?

Shady wait a minute baby leave the world alone just go up there and be humble and take them another time

Bush has just declared the World a fuckin' war zone

Meanwhile we got a war goin' on of our own at home

My fuckin' minds blown, tryin' to figure out how to fight my own clone

Rhine stones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night

After a hit of ecstasy ain't that right whoooaaaa

Wait a minute i'm ramblin', back to the matter at hand it's Green Lantern

With Elvis Presly the selfish MC back to ruin rap and destroy the industry 

Single handedly and oh man did we yeah me an 50, obie me and Twizzy, and Nelly, and Missy, and Jigga god damn it's all a plan devised by the man

It's a conspiracy again fake shit and anybody who can't make hits or dope shit lyrically

So fuck what ya hurd or what you read about

We ain't ruinin' rap baby we just tryna' weed it out

Shady in the place to be see

And I got what it takes to Roc The Mic right!

Still keep talking shit to me punk

Cause your magazine is over in less than six months 

hahah, Shady records, still aftermath

and don't think we can hear you muthafuckas talking, cause we can't, we don't hear y'all, so we're just gunna sit back for the rest of our lives while you ride our dicks."

Black magic, dark water (But it's like)
Surrounds me like no other (It's like I know you better than anyone)
She's got my heart in chains



We're volatile, I can't call it, though

It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (Yeah)

But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (Sneeze)

Last time I broke her collar bone, she's intolerable (Yeah)

All I know is that the sex is phenomenal, though

We're an unlikely pair (Yeah)

Like two different Nike Airs

But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)

So I think we're soulmates though (Yeah)

People don't like us together but like we care (Not me, not me)

Yeah, but God strikes me dead (Yeah)

She knows that I would walk over hot coals for her with both of my feet bare (Yeah)

As soon as I asked to hit (Asked to hit), it's like she grabs a switch (Grabs a switch)

Turns me over her knee, as my ass is whipped

Yeah, and I got her back, but I'm spineless (Yeah)

So when she stabs me in mine (Yeah), it's like I just can't feel the nitrous (What?)

She pokes, stabs, and then slices

One minute she'll build me up (Up)

The next, she'll push me 'round

Probably watchin', calls me ""Dumbbell""

She lifts me up (Yeah), then puts me down (Huh)

But I am under her thumbnail

I must be under her spell

It's like lookin' right into a gun barrel

But none of these hoes can fuck with my girl

She got that

She haunts me like no other

Nobody told me love is pain, oh

Black magic, dark water

Surrounds me like no other

She's got my heart in chains



We wake up, break up, make up

Like Maybelline, now she's all made up like make believe

Probably why she's so fake to me

But what the fuck's it gonna take for me to make her see?

Strip her naked and take her keys

I been plannin' this thing for weeks but I can't tell if I'm wake or sleep

But if this is actually happenin', sucker for pain

I'm stuck in this radioactive pattern

But hurt by her motherfuckin' hairs

All I imagine, dragon

She lunges, attacks, and scratches

But I ain't gonna stand for that shit

Like Kaep for the National Anthem

As I stab 'em, laughin'

So much for witchcraft and magic

Abracadabra that bitch

No turnin' back, I'm blackin'

As I say farewell to love of my life, I cut and I slice

I give her one last hug, goodbye

Wipe the blood off my butterfly knife

Watch her fuckin' die right in front of my eyes

But in hindsight, think I just wanted to see what her insides look like

As I pop another five Vic's

That's what this high's like

Look down, there's blood on my knife

Shovel at my side, blood on my mic

Now wake up to music to be murdered by

So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the

Bars that never slack, but always get attacked (Yeah)

I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that

Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit

'Cause I have this target on my back (Ew, yuck)

But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans

I'd probably pop five Xans (Yeah)

Go in my garage, start my van

Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can

And doze off like *snores*, but odds like that with these thoughts I have's

Like a giant getting squashed by ants

If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors

Like I just tossed my crayons (Tossed my crayons)

Small, medium, and large size cans

Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands

Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and

If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands



Shit, hold on, man

Motherfucker

Happy birthday to

Fuck (Shh, quiet)



I sit in silence in candlelit environments

Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent

Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this

But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes

Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this

I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch



What the fuck? Hold on, wait

""I'm Diddy's side bitch""?

Oh, I'm still east side, bitch



So until the E-N-D, since EPMD

Been givin' y'all the business (Yeah), D.R.E and me (Yup)

From the MMLP to MTBMB (Bitch)

Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (Haha)

So call me Santa Clause (Santa Clause)

'Cause at the present (Yeah), I out-rap 'em all, I'm at the mall

Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (Uh)

Through a plastic straw (Yeah) with a fractured jaw (Damn)

My dick is coat check (Ha), she wanna jack it off (Yeah)

I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law

Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (Duh)

Dukes of Hazzard car, get the cadaver dogs

'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked

This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (Brr)

This chicken hit my phone, she said, ""Chirp, chirp""

I said, ""Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt""

Then go eat some worms, like the early bird

What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word

Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth

Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt

And I won't buy a designer, 'cause I don't pander

But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (Damn)

And this the final chapter, 'cause I'm either frying after

Or they gon' give me the needle (What?) like a vinyl scratcher

Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark

At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art

And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't

No bite like a tree mostly just all bark, arf, arf

But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (Bark, bark, bar king)

And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park

I'd describe it as bowling (Why?) ball hard (Ball's hard)

'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when

It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten

'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again

And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens

The cypher begins

I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe

It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin

My mind is a recycling bin

There's no place I never been

But I never budge and I never bend

You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends

Like adult diapers for men

Even when I'm rappin' less stellar

It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller

Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth

And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route

So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds

Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you

But if bar's were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter

'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (Nah)

So you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap

Bitch, I'll pee on your head, like a Phillies hat (Haha)

No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree

Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree

You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea

You're always punkin' out like Halloween

You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk

Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump

You're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump

Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk

Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to

Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah

This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome

'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album

So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer

The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt

I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood

It's lookin' like it's that time of the month

Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt

I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but

Y'all'll get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos

I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable

Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome

Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo

Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope

You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole



Wait, why'd the beat cut off?

Fuck it"

What did you say?
Oh, I can't hear you
I have an ear infucktion and I cunt finger it out (Out, haha)
(I need auto tune)
Yeah



It's my alter-ego's fault, these evil thoughts can be so dark

Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts

I eat those off to Rico Suave, look it up

Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel

A backpack full of Paxil

A black satchel, a nap sack and a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels

Girl, let's go back, back to my castle (Yeah)

I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra

But my dick's an acronym 'cause it stands for you (Oh)

You, wait, Alexandra who? (Damn)

All I know is Friday, I met you (What?)

Saturday, I'll probably forget you

Guess that's what the Molly and X do (What the fuck?)

'Cause who the fuck am I laying next to? (Eh)

But ever since D-Nice ""To tha Rescue""

Feel a fresh crew (Uh), been a lab rat (Yeah)

From a test tube (Uh), I'm goin' in like the red roof (Red Roof Inn)

You don't like it, eat a cock 'til your jaw breaks

Call it caught between a rock and a hard place

Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace

'Cause you're watching your heart race like you're Scarface

In a car chase with the cops or an arcade

Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race, stuck in saw blades

At a stop and a start pace

What I'm tryin' to say is, I'm drivin' 'em all crazy



I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone deaf)

I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone deaf)

I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone deaf)

'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (Yeah, yeah)



I see the rap game then attack the verses (Uh)

Turn into a graveyard packed with hearses (Yeah)

Just like your funeral, I'm at your service (What?)

Pockets on stuffed like a taxidermist (Woo)

Just landed in Los Angeles when this chick Angela and her grandmother in a tan

Colored van pulled up with a hand full of Xans

And a substantial amount of ganja, just to ask what my

Plans for the night are (Yeah)

I said sneakin' to the Sleep Inn for the weekend and pretend it's a five star

Yeah, I leap into the deep end of the pool, I can show you where the dives are

We don't even gotta drive far

I know this spot that is so live, but I'm tryna get some head first, like a nose dive (Haha)

So many side chicks, can't decide which to slide with and which should I ditch

So when it comes to ass, bitch, I get behind like the Heimlich (Yeah)

Had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin' sides shit

Pushed her out the side, kicked, then I flipped

The lil' white bitch off like a light switch (Bitch)

It's okay not to like my shit

Everything's fine, drink your wine, bitch

And get offline, quit whinin', this is just a rhyme, bitch

But ask me, will I stick to my guns like adhesive tape?

Does Bill Cosby sedate once he treats the cheesecake and the decent steak?

You think gettin' rid of me's a piece of cake?

I'm harder than findin' Harvey Weinstein a date (Haha)

And that's why they say I got more lines than Black Friday

So save that shit for the damn library (Shh)

You heard of Chris Christophesen? (Yeah) Well, I am piss piss off'ed-eson (Oh)

Paul's askin' for Christmas off again

I said, ""No,"" then I spit this song for him, it goes:



I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone deaf)

I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone deaf)

I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone deaf)

'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)



Bitch I can make an orange rhyme with banana, oranana

Eating pork rinds, sword fightin' in pajamas

At the crib, playin' Fortnite with your grandma

But I'm more like I'm 4'5"" with the grammar

Bitch, 'bout to show you why your five favorite rappers, can't touch this

But before I get the hammer, I should warn you I'm Thor-like in this manner

But the day I lose sleep over you critiquin' me or

I ever let you cocksuckers eat at me

I'd need to be a motherfuckin' pizzeria, but you ain't gettin' no cheese from me

I went from Lil' Ceasers, BLT-ses, grilled cheeses

Bein' dirt poor to filthy rich, I'm still me, bitch

Like a realtor, it's realty, bitch (Real talk)

Aftermath, bitch, whole camp's lit

We put out fire, Dre stamps it

With my cohorts, hit up Bogart

Yeah, got your whole squad yellin', ""Oh, God""

Here comes Marshall, with no holds barred

Bitch, I'm a hurricane, you're a blow hard

Like your old broad, she full of semen, like the coast guard

And life's been pretty good to me so far, for the most part

Had a couple of run-in's with popo, caught

A couple assault charges, got a few priors like crowbars

Which is so odd 'cause I'm forty-eight now

That 5-0's startin' to creep up on me like a patrol car

I'll be an old fart, but you don't want no part, so bitch, don't start

Simmer down, compose yourself, Mozart

I ain't went nowhere, call me coleslaw

'Cause I'm out for the cabbage and I'm so raw

And if time is money, you have no clocks

And any folk caught within close proximity's gettin' Colt cocked

My enemies I'm a chimney give me the smoke, opps

And R.I.P. to King Von, and it don't stop, and I know not

What the fuck you say? I told y'all, it ain't me, it's my alter-ego's fault

But if y'all wanna cancel me, no prob'

I'll tell you the same thing I told Paul



I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone deaf)

I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone deaf)

I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone deaf)

Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, I'm in my bag (My bag)

Get a little testy whеn I'm mad (I'm mad), sick of wrestling this iPad (iPad)

Unsuccessfully, I might add

And I know it's best to lеave it lie

But even I get obsessed with reading everything

And let it get the best of me 'til I snap ('Til I snap)

But I need to get off the internet (Get off the internet)

I need to get on the mic (Get on the mic)

You need to get off the internet (Internet)

You need to get you a life

Why you waste time just to comment on shit? (Comment on shit)

Especially shit you don't like (Shit you don't like)

Don't like it, don't listen, but don't tell me 'bout your favorite rapper rippin' some shit he didn't write (Shit he didn't write)

What happened to Slim? He was no cap with the pen

He used to rap like the people his music was for

He was exactly like them

The dude used to be poor, why can't he tap into him?

Can't use that excuse anymore

He's mad at the wind, he's in a nuclear war

With a cloud, he's yellin' at it again

I talked to your mother, she told me she love me

All she wanna do is just hold me and hug me

Wants nobody but me, she showed me the Dougie

Can I get a witness like notary public? (Preach)

She said, ""Kick some fly shit"" (Fly shit)

I said, ""I got wings on my ass"" (Wings on my ass)

Told her my dick's a cockpit (Dick's a cockpit)

I fly by the seat of my pants (Seat of my pants)

Sinful thoughts, this beat is crazy, this shit's retarded

This instru's mental (This instru's mental) to mini-bars, incidental charges

When did it start? I been cold-hearted in this heart since kindergarten

Mental sharpness which makes Slim a walking dentist office, bitch, I invented flossin'

Yeah, I used to wonder (I used to wonder) where my next meal's gonna come from (Meal's gonna come from)

Now, I just wonder (Now I just wonder) where my next mill's gonna come from (Mill's gonna come from)

I cannot have no success (Have no success), unless when I finally make it (Finally make it)

I get to remind all the haters (Remind all the haters) who shitted on me when I'm on my way up (I'm on my way)

My floor is y'all fool's ceilings

If I was you, I would step or find yourself twisted

That's how you'll wind up like spiral stairs

I will swear on a stack of Bibles

I will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols, I don't care

It's Music to Be Murdered By, so Bon Iver can swallow a fuckin' Ja Rule bobblehead

And die slow like Alzheimer's (Ha-ha)

Lone sniper, I hold a microphone like a loaded rifle

My dome's brighter, all I spit from my skull's fire

All that's missing's a motorcycle with the chrome wires, spoke tires

And y'all are flow biters, so I don't gotta

Explain why they call me your ghostwriter

I said I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)

Get 'em all off my pad (Yeah), every thought that I had (Illa)



Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, it's in my bag

I tend to get a little testy when I'm mad

But gift of gab and pen to pad turn temper tantrums into anthems

Put lips to ass and kiss the cracks, spit your damnedest

You're still gonna hit the canvas

Rippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers

Mr. Mathers is killin' this shit, villainous wit with scant less

Syllables rip the planet, biblical shit's finna hit the fan

Anybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that

Then the amygdala hippocampus is gonna trigger the ignoramus

To think of the most ridiculous shit to spit then

Pin it against these pitiful rappers

Insidious, these idiots wittiest shit against me shitty as MC Hammer's

Get your whole squad, send a task force in

If you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for then

Put your helmet on, strap your chin

You're 'bout to get you a crash course in

Who not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with

Or to go against, fuck would you wanna do that for?

No offense, but are you retards slow or dense?

A fuckin' penny has more sense

Yeah, now you gotta get killed, but it's not a big deal, but every thought is so ill

And so methodical, thought I swallowed a pill

I'm startin' to feel like I'm an automobile

With Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel

Inside a carnival, 'cause I'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snidey articles

And that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill

Joy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame, choice I made

Swore someday the world would pay, less to lose, more to gain

Daughters raised, yesterday, glory days, adored and praised

Ignore the hate, address the fake

Toured with Dre, tore a page from Jordan King

Destroyed the game, before you came, enjoy your stay

Before it's gone away, but the more you claim

That you're gonna point and aim

If you join their gang, your shit isn't goin' to bang

You're just boring, lame and more the same

You have an enormous chain, but a storm-less brain

The most you could form is rain

Your shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game

So, bitch, quit lyin', you're denyin' like Mr. Porter's name

Borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller

Eyes rollin' back in my skull like Eli Porter

Fire motor (Brr), rounds I told to every iota or I load up

I owe to my motor, mouth

This is my note to self

Sometimes you're gonna bomb

So you might just have to blow yourself up with no one's help

I just wrote it down in my book of rhymes

Preemo, take us out



Writin' in my book of rhymes

My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside

You know what I mean? (Yeah)

It's not real (Yeah)

Switched it up, then everybody—

Done changed the shit on that damn—

Yeah, everybody done ran through it

Mumble rappin'

Ain't no more substance in shit

Right, right

They don't treat it the way it needs to be treated

I kinda want that old thing back



Yeah, I was young, I was hungry

I was chasin' the bag at twenty-one, I was lucky

To find an unеaten fucking (What?) honeybun I forgot about

Now I got money falling out, fiftiеs, hundreds, and twenties (Twenties)

And I know nothing is funny 'bout the Manchester bombing

But we got something in common (What?), both of us are alarming

Foul, disgusting, and awful (Yeah), so repugnant and ugly (Yup)

I could give the Boston Marathon a run for its money, yeah

And you could say I'm a little bit immature

But this type of literature got me a little richer

But I get insecure when them other dudes hit on you, girl

You're letting 'em fiddle with your clitoris

Remember you were my fucking—



You used to be my favorite bitch

Things'll never be the same, ain't it funny how you changed

Up and flipped the script?

You done let a bunch of lames fall through and complain

That I can't permit

You ain't have to do it like that, told you I'll be right back

Look what you did, I need a new chick

Like the music, I had to bounce on my favorite bitch



Always hated my smile

Mama told me it's goofy

I'd get picked on at school

Come home and she'd school me

She never sugarcoated it to me

She said if I wasn't so stupid and ugly, I wouldn't always get bullied (True)

I think of my struggles (Yeah) and get emotional

Could be 'cause how behind the eight-ball and far in the hole that they put me

Now I'm on a roll like a Tootsie (Yeah)

I'm just trollin' you pussies

But I'm like a stroller 'cause you'll see just how I roll if you push me

But that's what I do this music for

When I was goin' through some of the hardest times, I drew from her

But she's like the devil 'cause I just can't let loose of her

Plus the thought of losin' her makes me wanna just let loose on her

Then I hit the studio, tryna rendezvous with her

Tell her, ""It's a butt-dial girl,"" yeah, booty call (Haha)

That's how it used to be, 'cause you and me, we ruled the world

And we made Curtis blow (Fifty)

Fuck, I miss them days



You used to be my favorite bitch

Things'll never be the same, ain't it funny how you changed

Up and flipped the script?

You done let a bunch of lames fall through and complain

You fuckin' leavin' me, bitch?

I don't think so, sit your motherfuckin' ass down

I swear to God, you run to that door

I'ma put one in the back of your fuckin' head

I'ma ask you this one time

And the answer better be, ""Yes""



Would you marry me again?

Now that everything is changed (Yeah)

It'll never be the same (Nah)

As the era whence we came (Who?)

From Nas to Pac, Rak' (Yeah), Eric B. and Kane (I know)

But I know a few from this era that are lyrically insane

And although most are never gonna hit the level Cole or Weezy at

Or be emotionally attached to Yo MTV Raps (Yeah)

Runnin' home from school to catch an episode

The feeling that it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape

You hold and peel it back, yeah

Tear it off, then play it (What?)

I swear to God, four o'clock

We'd crowd around the TV, Butter in his underwear and socks

When Nani was Kon Artis (Yeah) and Proof had his hair in locs (Doody)

Yeah, back when Flavor Flav had us wearing clocks

(Back when) Back when Ed Lover (Yeah)

When there was two Dr. Dre's, that's a paradox (Pair of Docs)

But I never thought I'd get so jealous

At the thought of letting you go psychologically

It's gonna bother me, my eyes are already watery

Part of me don't wanna stop (Yeah) 'til I get you back

'Cause I gotta put the work in and tell you I'm never givin' this up

Other part wants to tell you just to get fucked

Go back to whatever dick that you sucked (Ah)

Get back together with them, you slut

Givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist

When I helped you become bigger than you were

But I guess that it slipped your mind, you must be biding your time

Looking for someone to come along that'll make you feel like I did back when you were mine, huh? (Damn)

But truthfully, it was never really you and me exclusively

And there's too many new MC's you can choose between

But no matter how many motherfuckers ran through

Bet they can't do it like me

But I can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends

And I can't handle it when I leave and you find another one

Now I gotta take this beat and dismantle it

I won't grieve when I kill you

But if I can't have you, bitch, nobody can

Hear me? I used to be your favorite, bitch"

Still stackin' my chips, hoes, higher than Shaq on his tiptoes

Atop the Empire State Buildin', this shit is like child's play, children

I will not annihilate, kill them, I'll fuck around and pile eight million

Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then, I'll await my trial date 'til then

Ain't nothin' you say can ever Trump (Nah), mic, pencil get killed (Yeah)

If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (Chill)

I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violent but with skill

That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (Yeah, hold up)

And I'm still ride or die for the squad (Yeah)

So you know which side that I'm on

If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved

It'll be like K9's in a brawl

But not similar to Mike Vick at all

'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight

They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog

Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms

Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw and rip it off with one swipe of the paw

It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly

Which is what separates my flow from theirs, so that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me

So vocalistically (What?), that's social distancing (Yeah)

Flow going viral, you best stay strapped

With that Lysol and get way back

Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax

'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback

Bitch, back the fuck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (Face mask)

'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything

This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (Damn)

'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem like they just keep getting more extreme

Who knows when this nightmare will end? Like Monroe, Norma Jean

Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine

'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (Dope) and you're a fiend

And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (Nope), for some semblance of normalcy

But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (Yeah)

The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare

Mom fed me Valium like air

Thought that's why they called it a high chair (Woah)

I got a contact like eyewear

Woah, wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here

20/20 hindsight in my side mirror

Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square

My hair trigger whenever I get an idea

Fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop

And my drip was a drop

In the bucket, so that gun shot

You just heard just now in that one spot

Just came from the nine mil' that I just got

That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded

I ain't even mean to go the fuck off

I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate

Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy

I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'

Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating

I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded

Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia

With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T

Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault

When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly

I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on

Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close

You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony

I'm at the crib with your ho, got her at the pole like voting with no clothing

Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating

I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing

Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her

So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner

Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her

Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river

But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her

With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it

And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour

Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

You know I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah, I do, haha
I look at me now I'm thinkin, ""Damn""

How proud of me I am

What I did, it's nothin' to sneeze at

Even if your allergies are bad

I'm up in a balcony in France

I look around, I see the fans

How they surround me in the stands

Probably could drown in a sea of hands

They hollerin', ""Shady""

Yellin' it out to me and that's what I mean when I say

That one day someway, somehow, if I get a chance to get a crowd

I'll flip it around and have a crowd give me the chance

I've done it all, man

But in actuality I haven't, yet



Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh

Really I have no idea

All I know it's every time I think I hit my ceiling

I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh

Really I have no idea

All I know it's every time I think I hit my ceiling

I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been



Got no time for no haters in this bitch

Or toleration for this shit

But like medication, my dedication

And the time it takes to do this shit

Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waitin' room'll get

But I mean it's maybe I have more patience than I'm able to admit

Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch

Fame was a switch but I was grateful to trade that shit for the trailer with the hitch

Thought it would made me a ravin' lunatic

But I made it through to my situation, I hit pay dirt

Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch

But just 'cause I made a little bit of change

Don't mean I've changed a little bit

Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit

Now I'm just paradin', you would still get Shady 'til I'm eighty

To I spit this crazy, even Grady knows I'ma blow

Better get the handkerchief again, haha

I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been



Oh, now what am I gonna do?

Can't nothing hold me I'm on the loose

Born a winner, damn it's so hard to lose

I can do it and do it, when I'm tryin' to

When my records flop they still go through the roof

This atmosphere's for a chosen few

Who was on their grind, to get money moves

And you ain't gon' get that if you want it down

You gotta take shots with 100 proof



Check that

Been in survival mode

Since a five year old, it was I alone

Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone

But lookin' back how bad it was then

If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen

Addict mom and deadbeat dad

I wouldn't have the savage within

Havin' to win, every single battle I'm in

All I ever wanted was to be an MC

Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me

EPMD must've had teachin' degrees

Learn to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes

Would be as easy as eatin' graffiti

Would be like remedial readin' to me (Yeah)

'Til my last breath leave my lungs, I'ma beat my drums (Yeah)

For the streets I'm from (Yeah)

The East side slums (Yeah)

Gotta remind em (Yeah)

I take a foe out (Yeah), like fee-fi-fum

You see my finger (What?), you see my thumb (What?)

You see my fist, fuck a peach pipe bum (What?)

For the smoke but it's not the weed I want (What?)

With this beat I brung for the beef I come (Woo)

But you better bring it if you wanna reply from

'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up

That'll be an uphill battle

But I'm off kickin' feet in the recliner

And I think I'm up

'Bout to go out on a limb like a tree climber

Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause



Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh

Really I have no idea

All I know it's every time I think I hit my ceiling

I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Because they're so easy to see through 'em (See through 'em)

But a fighter's all I knew how to be

I got the shit beat out of me (Yeah)

Tripped and fell and blew out a knee (Pop)

Popped it back in and hopped up like, ""Fuck it (Fuck it)

Best two out of three"", yeah

Man, I gotta be doin' (What?) somethin' right

I got eleven years of sobriety (Yeah)

So, the only bottom I'ma be hittin' is if it's sodomy

Wait, I mean, you would think that somebody handed a saw to me

How I'm choppin' these bars

They keep wantin' me to rap responsibly

When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' Dollar Tree

But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty

Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun

And all that we want is racial equality

R.I.P. Laquan McDonald, Trayvon, and Breonna

Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique

Eric Garner and Rodney King

No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops

Who keep murderin' Blacks are off the streets (Off the streets)

And, as far as squashin' beef, I'm used to people knockin' me

But, just not in my camp

I'm diplomatic 'cause I'm tryna be

Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me

Man, dog, you was like a (Yeah) damn god to me

Man, not really (Haha)

I had ""dog"" backwards

But I'm startin' to think, all these people takin' shots at me

Shit, it's no wonder



I be on my own, head up in the clouds like Zeus

When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Ooh""

But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus

Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view (Ayy)

Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god (Ayy)

Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (Ayy)

You could give your whole damn life to the music thing

They gon' turn around like they don't love you"

I'm discombobulated
Let's take 'em back (Accents)
In time (Everything's all fucked up)
I'm discombobulated, discombobulated
Miss, you ovulating? Wait, I didn't mean to

Piss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is

It goes a little something like this



Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm

Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?

Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line

Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized

My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly

To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies

Then Proof, Denaun

Eye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to Drew's and rhyme

Bodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count

Before I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound

Now I'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers noggins how

Dre does every time he goes back to Compton now

'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds

And Doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out

Room is spinning like nine-hundred-thousand miles an hour

Forgot what I'm talkin' 'bout, fuck, I'm discombobulated



Now up is down, left is right

Day is night now, in is out, black is white

So to-and-fro and side-to-side

Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide

'Cause back is forth now and stop means go

No means yes, but yes don't mean no

So baby, please, take off your clothes

(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!), yeah



Just flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit

But the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce

And quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar

That's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (Haha)

Fuck it, I'm a kook, I know I got a screw

And a couple of marbles loose, brain is like ramen soup

Shout to Trugoy, gotta give a De La salute

'Cause my noodle's in a knot, call it pasta noose (Yeah)

Wizard of 'ahs' and 'ohhs'

Same Marshall Bruce in that battle who lost to Juice

Who also used to sound like Nas on ""Live at the Barbeque""

Now I got the juice, wouldn't beef if I was you



Like, au jus, but beef, if like

""I was you,"" but, like, ah, fuck you (Man)

Long as I got these walls and these hallways I'm always

Have someone to argue with, I'm just all twisted, I'm discombobulated



Now up is down, left is right

Day is night now, in is out, black is white

So to-and-fro and side-to-side

Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide

'Cause back is forth now and stop means go

No means yes, but yes don't mean no

So baby, please, take off your clothes

(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!)



I'm at my best when I'm at my worst

And for that I'm blessed, so every time I rap I curse

And that's why press, I usually get attacked by first

They're at my neck like motherfucking vampires

So critics si-day I si-day the same shi-dit, I'm always degrading, little bi-ditch

Well, fi-duck 'em, they can si-duck my di-dick when I'm taking shi-dit

Mid-y middle fid-inger is ex-tid-ended now, should I tell 'em where to put it?

I'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit

So I act like I'm on a kayak with my back to Niagara

No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists

Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, ""Why is it

My eye itches?"" so they gave me some diet tips

And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs

In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath

I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits

I just took an AIDS test and the doctor said to think positive, what the fuck?



Now up is down, left is right

Day is night now, in is out, black is white

So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
It's funny
As much as I hate you

I need you

This is music to be murdered by



Got a premonition

I feel the end is near

The beauty starts to fade

The joy has turned to pain

I hear the symphony playin'

Ten thousand violins

Souls floating away like feathers in the wind



They said my last album I sounded bitter

No, I sound like a spitter

Who ninety percent of

These hypocrites are tryna get rid of

But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?

I was considered, one time, as the illest

Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper

True, I just get richer

But if it was ever all about skrilla

Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago

Bitch, shut the fuck up

I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or the Jigga

Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit

No wonder you're mad, now I'm

Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)

I'm L. L. Cool J, bigger and deafer, that's how come (Uh)

I sell like four mill when I put out a bad album (What?)

Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em

But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta

Five, and I'll laugh out loud

'Cause that's what they gave bad back in the day

Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause

If it happened to James

It can happen to Shady

They do the same shit to Brady

More people hate me than love me

This game will make you go crazy

'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E

I was the G, the O-A-T

Once I was played in rotation

At every radio station

They said I’m lyrically amazing

But I have nothing to say

But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say

They said that they hated, they awake me

I lose the rage, I'm too tame

I get it back, they say I'm too angry

I need to get me some Dre beats

No, I should hook up with Tay Keith

Fans keep on pulling me one way

Haters pull me in another

Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee

'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches

They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby

I dish it out but can't take it

But I take it, dish it back out

And they get all bent out of shape

This shit's almost comical

Wait, and I meant no disrespect

I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z

They probably feel the same way because lately

Instead of us being credited for longevity

And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we

Get told we'll never be what we were

Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was

I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be

Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically

'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V

Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy

It's your funeral, prepare to die

This is music for you to be murdered by"

I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience

But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)

And I made a mil without a major deal (I made that)

Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)

Where does the pain go? (Where?)

Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)

To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)

Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)

Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose

Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)

Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed



Game over, Thanos on you H-O's

On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)

Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy

Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)

Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox, you're gonna need three SWATs

A police officer's at least cuffing me up for evading and I don’t stop

Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it

I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage

Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus

Stop it, cutting off your oxygen

And I hit them pads like a boxing gym

Better watch for Slim, better get to popping when I'm at the top again

I won't topple and I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop

But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is

I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers

I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns

And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students

Showed them all the blueprint and formula

But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs

I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)

But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game

Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting



Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini

Where's Osama been? I been laden lately

Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away

They wanna JonBenet me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

Man, I don't see why they hate me

I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy

They call me Kanye crazy

APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z

And I'm back with Andre, baby

And the doctor's operating

But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop kid out to Shady



Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset

'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet

That bimbo Kim put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow

Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo

Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no

I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo

And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero

Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill

Nickle-plated, twenty two, two, two

Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too

Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views

Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew

'Cause that's what I do, do, do

But, even to the untrained human eye

We ain't the same, you and I

Somebody should have explained to you why

For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)

That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah

But I know magic and here go my last trick

I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat

I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react

But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that

As I begin to fuckin' devour the track

And you backpedal that as a cowardly act

Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse



Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini

Where's Osama been? I been laden lately

Look at how I'm behaving me, they want me gone away

They wanna JonBenet me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating"

Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies

I walk in the crossroad, suicidal tightrope intentionally

While the demons comin' out of me

Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control

Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more

Make a bigot racist uncomfortable

Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)

On my last rock, for my slingshot

Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)

Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)

Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post

Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz

Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe

Through your living room window

Take your Nintendo and then skate

Making you feel like you got bent over and raped

Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain

Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter

As I got a little bit older, my hate

Was making me get cold, and began to get a chip shoulder

Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row

But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped

Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo

Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape

And I won't hesitate

To get 'em all bent so outta shape

Oh shit bro, hold up, wait

I just tripped over my cape (Superman)

And I'm not gonna let 'em treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter

Dre'll tell you how I shred

So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder

I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling

I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on

Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo

I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you

I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do

But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you

When we hit the club to go and hell-raise

Probably end up back in the cocktail waitress

And takin' her straight back to the motel, ayy

Yeah, Bizzare’s tryna get a lapdance

Off a Xan next to Jack Dan' (Ayo)

Stripper walk by, I'm like ""Goddamn""

She's like ""That's harassment,"" I'm like ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)

Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio

That's the best ass I’ve seen in a while

We should be datin’, she's from Cleveland

But she’s a bengal, this chick is catty

Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?

That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy

She said ""Fuck off"" and threw her liquor at me

It's one of those kinda nights

Then I said, I said



If you wanna go hard tonight

Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah

Slip into the red dress you like

When we arrive, we probably won’t leave, ah

I love the way you move like that

When you push your body on mine, oh my

You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise

It's one of those kinda nights



This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does

Only 'cause how good the sex was

Hit up the next club, met Alexa

But she was so extra, called her etcetera

Had her like, ""Oh my God

My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""

I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?

That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)

Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?""

She said, ""No, I'm bi""

She said, ""Are you drunk?,"" I said, ""No, I'm high

I'm checkin' out the chick,"" she said, ""So am I""

""What's in the cup, let me see that

Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at""

She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though

And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""

Said she wants to go with me

I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said, ""Out""

I said, ""I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me""

Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes the brigade

Turn like a flip page, 50 look shitfaced

Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day

Drivin' around, I said, ""Let's pull over,"" she said, ""No problemo

'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him

Rather have me (I know, but), we just in too deep



You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me

He's asleep, you say, ""Let's meet around three""

You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out

You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah

You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him

When he stumbles in, like, ""Where the fuck you've been?""

Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear

Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears

But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt

You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt

But now the lines are getting super blurred

Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her

But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love

Hope they don't ever hear us talk

'Cause we both are getting sloppy

Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause



I'm not happy here (Nah), with her

Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too

'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him

Rather have me (I know, but), we just in too deep



We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us

'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous

Of each other being someone else's

Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish

But I just wanna see ya

Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6

If I'm there with ya, rich or poor

When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor

I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'

I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah

I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all

So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it

Yeah, I'm open season

And I'm always game, so keep it a hundred, dear, haha

'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring

So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because



I'm not happy here (Nah), with her

Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too

'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him

Rather have me (I know, but), we just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)"

Consider it to cross me a costly mistake

If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia

ADHD, hydroxycut

Pass the Courvoisi' (Hey, hey)

In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate

Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday

This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A

Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flings

They cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)



Monster

You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)

I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)

When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers

I look like a villain outta those blockbusters

Godzilla, fire spitter, monster

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet



I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls

Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off

It's impossible to list 'em all

And in the midst of all this

I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball

Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?

Risperdal, voices whisper

My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn

This is just the song to go ballistic on

You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher

I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological

Quick to tell a bitch go off like a fifth of Vodka

When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a



Monster

You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)

If you never gave a damn, raise your hand

'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans

I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is

The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)

How can I have all these fans and perspire?

Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire

And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire

These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier

I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers

And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw

'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball

Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy

'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)

Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher

Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care

But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her

Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez

Christian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well

So they wanna give me the chair

Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Caray

'Cause every time a Dick and Harry carry and marry a motherfuckin' dictionary

Got 'em swearing up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious

It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column

We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem

Get the shaft like a staring column (Mark Jack)

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink

Give 'em half of the bad beats

Evil, that means take a back seat

Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single

Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people

Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle

I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto

Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

Other words, I Minute Maid 'em

I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage

I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him

Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake

Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em

And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid

And don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill

And I tell 'em kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla

You're bringin' the killer within me out of me

You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me

Or be recievin' enemy, what stupidity it'd be

Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter

When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck

Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me

A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me

I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable

You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable

I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Here I am, alone again

Can't get out of this hole I'm in

It's like the walls are closin' in

You can't help me, no one can

I can feel these curtains closin'

I go to open 'em

But something pulls 'em closed again

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas

Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost

But I'd make you this small wager

If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper

Who would the odds favor?

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him

I keep pacin' this room, Valium and chase it with booze

One little taste, it'll do

Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger

If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka

Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)

That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a Benzo

I can hear the music continue to crescendo

I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window

That's when you know you're schizo (Hello darkness, my old friend)

'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel

The music is so loud

But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound

I should get ready for the show now

Wait is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact

Then something told me relax

And just hope for the show to be packed

Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max

'Cause that'd be totally wack

You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness, my old friend)

But what if nobody shows? Panic mode

'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second

'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance

Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions (Hello darkness, my old friend)

The press is about to go ape shit bananas on all the networks

Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers

I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed

Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser

Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the Scope

I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds

With them benzodiazepines gone

Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor

Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore



People start to show up, time to start the show up (Hello darkness, my old friend)

It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up

And I'm already sweatin' but I'm locked and loaded

For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers

Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere

As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel

Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze

Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner

With no prior convictions, so loss, the sky's the limit

So my supplies infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier

Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences

Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance

Guess show time is over

No suicide note, just a note for target distance

But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this

You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea

I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness

Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked

'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



Yeah, we do have some breaking news from the Associated Press right now, just gonna bring that up because we are hearing we have told you that the shooter is dead and we have just learned that police are saying that the Las Vegas shooter killed himself

That is the bartender there at Mandalay Bay and I believe we're going to hear more

Yeah, we just wanted to share that with you, you can see behind me here, this is what he looks like, now we did just tell you that police just earlier, Metro was telling us that he killed himself inside the hotel room"

Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)

'Cause they just wind up on their backs

Now the sky's nothing but black

But I am not coming back, I done told ya

I told the woke me to go to sleep

But still, they keep on provoking me

They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally

But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke

When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now



I'm leaving Heaven

I'm leaving Heaven

Angels won't find me

Where are you going?



I've been down, kicked

Like around six thousand times since I was a kid

As a child, picked on, clowned

Countless times I've been outed

Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)

So the route I went's self-empowerment

In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it

And balance it with talents, wit

'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)

'Cause it's only one percent

Who overcome the shit they've underwent

I went AWOL like what my back was up against

Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it

I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked

Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle

And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah

But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment

Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks

But I swore I'd get them back

Even if it meant selling my soul to get revenge and (What?)

Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking

If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it

That’s part of the reason I do all my talking when He can

And as long as I'm breathing I vow to smother and beat them

Got a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even

Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end

This evil is calling, I'm already seething and



I'm leaving Heaven

I'm leaving Heaven

Angels won't find me

Where are you going?



Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)

I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)

Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep

Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see

If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat

If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece

Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips

We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split

We'd do backward flips, looking back at it

I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit

Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit

Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit

Yeah, which brings me back to the real dad that I zero had

Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab

Just to hear them words, ear piercing

Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring

Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died

Me? Tear no shed

Should I have made a mural at your funeral?

Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?

Where the fuck you were at

When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?

Never met your grandkids, fucking coward

Only gut you had was from your stomach fat

I couldn't see your ass gonna Heaven

So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell

So I can whip your fucking ass

I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face

No coming back from where I'm going

Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel

Dig with the blade up, and then I step on the metal

Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil



I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)

I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)

Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)

Where are you going? (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)

I'm leaving heaven (Fuck you, bitch)

I'm leaving heaven (You know what? Maybe if I had had you)

Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)

Where are you going? (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")

('Cause I wouldn't have been me)



So you better, you better run (Yeah)

You better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)

You better, you better run (Cocksucker)

You better, you better run (See you in Hell)"

Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em

Leave these pussies stretched out, like the Octo-Mom

Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times

Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out

Me and this game, we got married already

Had the prenup ready, fuck, all that's ever seen her belly

She barely was three months pregnant

(This song's about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad



One thing that sticks in my craw

When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom

Socked her right in her eyeball

I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic

With all the pictures that I draw of

Shit that I already witnessed, this probably twisted my thoughts

All I can hear is drama with mom and him

I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways

The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm

My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard

Doctors had to put it down

He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!



I, I, hate

My, my stepdad (Stepdad)

So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)



Outside, I look like I'm calm

Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb

'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)

Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on

But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him

Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times

He swatted me with it, I'm cryin'

He just started hittin' me harder

God, I just wish I could jaw him

If I could get my weight up

But I'm just a second grader

This prick is bigger than I am

But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide

I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time

Sneak up with a lethal injection

And put him down like they did to my dog

I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan

This fuckin' shit's like Saigon

Neighbors called police on him

So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium ion

Then mom and him let bygones (Bygones)

Just be bygones

So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off

But this why I



I, I, hate

My, my stepdad (Stepdad)

So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)



So this year, I'm goin' to the fifth and I'm tall

I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got

Way bigger fish to fry

Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off

The hand'll wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box

He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan

So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons

I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'

He walks by, kicks my arm and goes ""Whoops"" and just laughs

I yelled for mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense

I stood up and said, ""Fuck you punk"" and I took off and ran

To my bedroom, as I fled

Knowin' shit would hit the fan

Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat

He kicked it in

I swung it hard as I could at his head

His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed

I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear

I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass

Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad

""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his

Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter with

Then buried him next to my dog

And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em



I, I, hate

My, my stepdad (Stepdad)

So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

'Cause I, I, hate

My, my stepdad (Stepdad)

So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)"

Ha! I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit?
Checked in at the Royal Garden

To chill and avoid my problems

Until paranoia caused me to feel like I'm going bonkers

For real, think my toilet's talkin'

I spilled like, like forty bottles of pills

Think your boy is startin' to feel like a spoiled carton of milk

'Cause it just occurred

My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fuckin' bitch to the curb

But the word ""fuckin'"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word

The type of bitch she is ain't no adjective, it's a verb

Ho thinks her snatch is magical but that's how she attracts men and who traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid

Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow

In fact it'll be nothing to throw that lil' Bitch with a capital B at the back window out the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo

When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet

A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll

Been fire bitch, I can't outrap Reynolds

Apparently it'll be great but a napkin'll do

Return of the whack sicko

Head spinnin' like invisible scratch pickles

Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal

It's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a Louisville slugger and crapped it, I'd like to introduce myself

Hi there, bitch my name is-



My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)

S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)

Call me extra, extra terrestrial

Extra, extra, extra terrestrial



I could keep beefing

Fuck is the point?

I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit

If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L

I'd rather just see you in hell but I should get puff on the joint (Diddy)

Wait, run it back, I said gave you an L, in hell

Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid

Used to get jumped for my poems

When I was growin' up they said a slinky's a wonderful toy

My mother thought I was such a fun little boy

""Oh, what a bundle of joy!""

Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin

From the tantrum I was throwing

Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee, I don't cut the beat till I fuckin' destroy it

Once I get going rain thunder it's storming

Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice

In my head said it's still a dream

Then he said kill emcee's

Trippie Redd, with pills on lean

Sippin' meds in the limousine

Getting head, guillotine



My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)

S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)

Call me extra, extra terrestrial

Extra, extra, extra terrestrial



Yeah

So all of y'all can just suck a penis (Suck a penis)

I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)

Eat you pussies like cunnilingus (Like cunnilingus)

There ain't no stopping it (There ain't no stopping it)

They say I'm such a genius (They say I'm such a genius)

When that kamikaze hits (When that kamikaze hits)

Now they call me ""Butter fingers"" (They call me ""Butter fingers"")

'Cause I just keep droppin' shit (I just keep droppin' shit)

You wanna butt heads?, shut up Beavis, ha ha

I got your bitch with her butt out

I'm hittin' a lick and she stickin' her tongue out

You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out

She 'bout to give up the dug out

I should just live in a nut house

Right now, I live in an igloo (Yeah)

And I'm not chillin' the fuck out

Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and

Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man

I'm a stan of Redman, X-Clan and I'm a Treach fan

But I look up to myself (Yeah)

Like a fucking headstand (Yeah)

So why, w-w-why else, would I call myself an alien

How could I hit a dry spell (Yeah), I'm named after the wet lands



I'm Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)

S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural

Call me extra, extra terrestrial

Extra, extra, extra terrestrial

My name is Marsh and, my name is, my name is

My name is Marsh"

Still, it's no excuse to abuse you
But no one knows what I'm goin' through, so I used you
To be truthful, I wouldn't know what to do if I lose you
So I refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you

'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', ""Screw you""

Next I take it back, guess you can say I'm tryna unscrew you

But the shit's about to pop off, yeah, I feel you up

Then I got you totally open as soon as I take your top off

You're so hard to resist, you knock my socks off

My friends say you're bad for me, hogwash



I'll never love again

The way I loved you

Did you find someone new?

Are you doin' this with them?

'Cause I remember when

Still remember when you was mine, yeah

We were inseparable at one time, yeah

You know my love for you was undying, yeah

You used to always have my back



Some days it feels like you're all that I have

That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can

And you just want me for my money so I got you wrapped all in saran

Damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand

But if not for my financials

I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample

Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull

Myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful

I can only take so much of you all at one time

Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes

Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side

I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest

Yeah, baby we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious

Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives

Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis

Such a wide range of emotions

Migraines, but why the fuck am I takin' these MOTRINs?

Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean

And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken

But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it



I'll never love again

The way I loved you

Did you find someone new?

Are you doin' this with them?

'Cause I remember when

Still remember when you was mine, yeah

We were inseparable at one time, yeah

You know my love for you was undying, yeah

You used to always have my back



So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you

Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality

Somehow it seems like when I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep

You're bound to creak

'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me

You're my Xanax and my valium, I'm an addict you're a downer

You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet

But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof

A scoundrel and fiends how I feel around you

Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket

Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through

Everything that we've gone through

How many times you've fucked me

But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you

Swore my fealty, but word to G.O.D

I thought you loved me, but you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you

Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to

The Ambien and Tylenols too

Fuck all you



Fuckin' bitch

We're done"

Too scandalous, Sue Atkins

The kinda crazy you can't fix

I'm still the one your parents hate

I’m in your house eatin' carrot-cake

While I sit there and wait and I marinate

I'm irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate

And come home to find yourself starin' straight into a fuckin' barrel like Sharon Tate

Raise the concerto while I narrate

Yeah, you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin' arrow shape

I be on a higher plane in aerospace

With so much leg-room and air space on this airplane

Smart aleck, goddammit

Fuck is that? Stop hammering (God)

That's what it sounds like in my brain

Much as I fight to restrain

I have the right to remain violent

Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you

Icicle veins, mics will get slain

Life it will strangle you with bicycle chain

You're gonna have to come identify the remains

Wait, what?

I said my head is twisted like a red tie (Yup)

Can't get a fuckin' word in, edgewise (Shut up)

Success overnight like a red eye (Bitch)

Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy from the Westside

I'm hot dog, no you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar, admires

And the appliances like washers and dryers

Chick ran up like, ""Marshall, you're fire""

I looked down and said, ""No, I'm not, you're a liar""

She said, ""No, your music""

Heard you're back with the Dr. and I heard

Was a ghetto boy, now I ball out like Bushwick Bill (Hi ho)

New boobs? (Yeah) Where you get them done?

You want smoke, I got the tical like Method Man

So get ready to die from second hand

Get a whiff of the doctor's medicine

Like sedatives you'll get popped, Excedrin

'Cause you can get it like over the counter (Yo)

Like I just left the damn concession stand (Yeah)

A mic in my hand's a weapon (What?)

I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land

Too fly, I don't plan to ever Cinderella Man

What I am is better than

Every single one of you

Whether separate or all of you band together

And I put the game on the pill (Yeah)

Now my Shady babies are all stillborns

Meaning abortions that live 'cause they were still born

I can heal 'em with Neosporin

You 'bout to experience euphoria

You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd fuck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work

You're still a cunt

I'm still a fucking jerk

Same as it ever was, yeah

Say it'll change but it never does

Ain't gonna ever 'cause

You're the cause of my pain and the medicine

Never met someone who played games with my head as much

Fate tethered us together like two felons

Must've fell in love with skeletons

Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but

Feels like I slept with the wicked stepmother

But how the hell am I

Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of

They say love the one you quit

But this shit is killing us

I lust on some other shit

I'm a glutton for punishment

You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts

It's above and beyond us

Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven

If I catch you sucking another dick

You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again

Why am I tucking you in?

Probably 'cause



I gotta tell myself another lie

'Cause that's what helps to get me by

'Cause I'm in Hell

This is my goodbye, farewell



Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you

Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you

Wanna heal you, yeah

Wanna lose you, keep you bruised

You be the abuse you treat, you mutual

It's juvenile, delusional, it's usual

You're beautiful, I'm average

I'm brutal, you're a savage

My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising

Yeah it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick

Though we might get along like shit

Fight, hit, fight, spit, unite, split

Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine

And they say love is blind, we see each other fine

But it's no wonder, I'm the only one you'll find

To put up with your shit, I need a plumber line (Yeah)

But nothing comes to mind besides a number 90

'Cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down

Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now

Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows, make it rain upwards

We're on the ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds

I should fly south, 'cause man am I great and land in myself

But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm outtie five thou'

But this is my house, bitch you get out

Then we duke it out, then it dies down

Then we say, ""Fuck it"", cry our eyes out

Then...



I gotta tell myself another lie

'Cause that's what helps to get me by

'Cause I'm in Hell

This is my goodbye, farewell



This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be

Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts

'Cause that's what attracts us

Trick you with a back rub

Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub

Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic

But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us

I love you but I won't exchange vows

Hey now, don't get carried away

No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wet us

Yeah, but we're so insane about each other

May take the same route and way out as junior stay out

Break out Berettas lay down in bed and blow our brains out together

Who knows how it's gonna play out?

A weathered desk where our ending would be

One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee

But I go to bat for you, defending your honor

Yeah, no contingency fees, something will not knock

We're not pretending to be, don't cost a penny to be with me

Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke

Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing

Could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine

Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea

Guess I'm a prisoner see, addiction is a disease



I gotta tell myself another lie

'Cause that's what helps to get me by

'Cause I'm in Hell

This is my goodbye, farewell

They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding

All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from

But it's happening again, huh?

Y'all used to be in my corner

Now you just backed me in one

Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some

For some adversaries, I carry big guns

So some targets'll get the kill shot

Some, I just barely nicked 'em

I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump

Or sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit

Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt

Shoulda never made a response to the disdain for the fake ones

Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts

They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once

And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'

And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'

For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'

But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'

Weapon never unholstered without firin'

My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion

They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle

'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars

But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards

Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on

Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an ant hill

'Cause I said motherfuck school and instead went to special ed

Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time

That I startled my mom and had her scared to death

Word to Method Man

She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio

She was like, ""What the heck was that?""

She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck

Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""

Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel

Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always

Rejoice in the sound of my voice, bitch, you don't have a choice

Using about a fourth to create the amount of force

It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylen— or

Enter my house of whores with a thousand floors

Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns

But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store

I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse

Than a fourty-some bar Lord Jamar verse

Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse

You could say I swore to protect

My image I have zero time or regard for

I never was, been claiming rap when it's not yours

If it was anyone's house G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors

Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks

Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link

Rest of these youngins of mine

Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds

'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why

I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just suns in my eyes

Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it

Next door to an abortion clinic

Newborn infants tortured and tormented

With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented

Their corpses get ornamented

The corner where the store has been rented

To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'

Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending

This is only the beginning

So Lord forgive me, I'm hearing voices

I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning



I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""

I had no other choice that was left except fill

My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil

He wants me to murder this beat, so I will

He told me there are doubters who question my skill

They wanna put my style to the test, am I still

The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill

If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""



And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)

I do my best to try to block it (Redrum)

I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)

I'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)"

We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
It's funny
As much as I hate you

I need you

This is music to be murdered by



Got a premonition

I feel the end is near

The beauty starts to fade

The joy has turned to pain

I hear the symphony playin'

Ten thousand violins

Souls floating away like feathers in the wind



They said my last album I sounded bitter

No, I sound like a spitter

Who ninety percent of

These hypocrites are tryna get rid of

But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?

I was considered, one time, as the illest

Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper

True, I just get richer

But if it was ever all about skrilla

Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago

Bitch, shut the fuck up

I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or the Jigga

Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit

No wonder you're mad, now I'm

Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)

I'm L. L. Cool J, bigger and deafer, that's how come (Uh)

I sell like four mill when I put out a bad album (What?)

Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em

But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta

Five, and I'll laugh out loud

'Cause that's what they gave bad back in the day

Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause

If it happened to James

It can happen to Shady

They do the same shit to Brady

More people hate me than love me

This game will make you go crazy

'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E

I was the G, the O-A-T

Once I was played in rotation

At every radio station

They said I’m lyrically amazing

But I have nothing to say

But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say

They said that they hated, they awake me

I lose the rage, I'm too tame

I get it back, they say I'm too angry

I need to get me some Dre beats

No, I should hook up with Tay Keith

Fans keep on pulling me one way

Haters pull me in another

Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee

'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches

They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby

I dish it out but can't take it

But I take it, dish it back out

And they get all bent out of shape

This shit's almost comical

Wait, and I meant no disrespect

I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z

They probably feel the same way because lately

Instead of us being credited for longevity

And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we

Get told we'll never be what we were

Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was

I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be

Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically

'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V

Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy

It's your funeral, prepare to die

This is music for you to be murdered by"

To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)

Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)

Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose

Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)

Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed



Game over, Thanos on you H-O's

On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)

Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy

Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)

Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox, you're gonna need three SWATs

A police officer's at least cuffing me up for evading and I don’t stop

Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it

I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage

Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus

Stop it, cutting off your oxygen

And I hit them pads like a boxing gym

Better watch for Slim, better get to popping when I'm at the top again

I won't topple and I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop

But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is

I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers

I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns

And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students

Showed them all the blueprint and formula

But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs

I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)

But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game

Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting



Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini

Where's Osama been? I been laden lately

Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away

They wanna JonBenet me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

Man, I don't see why they hate me

I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy

They call me Kanye crazy

APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z

And I'm back with Andre, baby

And the doctor's operating

But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop kid out to Shady



Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset

'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet

That bimbo Kim put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow

Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo

Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no

I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo

And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero

Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill

Nickle-plated, twenty two, two, two

Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too

Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views

Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew

'Cause that's what I do, do, do

But, even to the untrained human eye

We ain't the same, you and I

Somebody should have explained to you why

For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)

That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah

But I know magic and here go my last trick

I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat

I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react

But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that

As I begin to fuckin' devour the track

And you backpedal that as a cowardly act

Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse



Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini

Where's Osama been? I been laden lately

Look at how I'm behaving me, they want me gone away

They wanna JonBenet me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating"

I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty

Profitin' all for coppin' and scrappin' that property all for a possible monopoly

Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies

Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy

I walk in the crossroad, suicidal tightrope intentionally

While the demons comin' out of me

Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me

Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me

Right there since '96, worse nightmare to side chicks, some things are just meant to be

Deal with life

This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me

Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy

Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control

Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more

Make a bigot racist uncomfortable

If y'all against talk and reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation

Never sold dope, from the gold rope

Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)

Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)

Didn't have knots, I was so broke

On my last rock, for my slingshot

Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)

Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)

Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post

Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz

Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe

Through your living room window

Take your Nintendo and then skate

Making you feel like you got bent over and raped

Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain

Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter

As I got a little bit older, my hate

Was making me get cold, and began to get a chip shoulder

Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row

But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped

Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo

Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape

And I won't hesitate

To get 'em all bent so outta shape

Oh shit bro, hold up, wait

I just tripped over my cape (Superman)

And I'm not gonna let 'em treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter

Dre'll tell you how I shred

Got several bounties from feds in every county

I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on

Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo

I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping

Do not let me catch you slippin'

I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you

I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do

But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you

Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune

I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear

Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair

When we hit the club to go and hell-raise

Probably end up back in the cocktail waitress

And takin' her straight back to the motel, ayy

Yeah, Bizzare’s tryna get a lapdance

Off a Xan next to Jack Dan' (Ayo)

Stripper walk by, I'm like ""Goddamn""

She's like ""That's harassment,"" I'm like ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)

Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio

That's the best ass I’ve seen in a while

We should be datin’, she's from Cleveland

But she’s a bengal, this chick is catty

Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?

That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy

She said ""Fuck off"" and threw her liquor at me

It's one of those kinda nights

Then I said, I said



If you wanna go hard tonight

Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah

Slip into the red dress you like

When we arrive, we probably won’t leave, ah

I love the way you move like that

When you push your body on mine, oh my

You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise

It's one of those kinda nights



This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does

Only 'cause how good the sex was

Hit up the next club, met Alexa

But she was so extra, called her etcetera

Had her like, ""Oh my God

My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""

I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?

That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)

Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?""

She said, ""No, I'm bi""

She said, ""Are you drunk?,"" I said, ""No, I'm high

I'm checkin' out the chick,"" she said, ""So am I""

""What's in the cup, let me see that

Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at""

She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though

And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""

Then I said

Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me

Said she wants to go with me

I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said, ""Out""

I said, ""I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me""

Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes the brigade

Turn like a flip page, 50 look shitfaced

Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day

Drivin' around, I said, ""Let's pull over,"" she said, ""No problemo

Windows are dark tint, roll up the car windows

You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out

You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah

You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him

When he stumbles in, like, ""Where the fuck you've been?""

Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear

Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears

But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt

You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt

But now the lines are getting super blurred

Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her

But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love

Hope they don't ever hear us talk

'Cause we both are getting sloppy

Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause



I'm not happy here (Nah), with her

Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too

'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him

Rather have me (I know, but), we just in too deep



We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us

'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous

Of each other being someone else's

Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish

But I just wanna see ya

Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6

If I'm there with ya, rich or poor

When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor

I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'

I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah

I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all

So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it

Yeah, I'm open season

And I'm always game, so keep it a hundred, dear, haha

'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring

So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because

Give 'em half of the bad beats

Evil, that means take a back seat

Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single

Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people

Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle

I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto

Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

Other words, I Minute Maid 'em

I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage

I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him

Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake

Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em

And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid

And don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill

And I tell 'em kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla

You're bringin' the killer within me out of me

You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me

Or be recievin' enemy, what stupidity it'd be

Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter

When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck

Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me

A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me

I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable

You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable

I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

I'm not afraid to pull the



Man, stop

Look what I'm plannin', haha"

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Here I am, alone again

Can't get out of this hole I'm in

It's like the walls are closin' in

You can't help me, no one can

I can feel these curtains closin'

I go to open 'em

But something pulls 'em closed again

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas

Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost

But I'd make you this small wager

If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper

Who would the odds favor?

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him

I keep pacin' this room, Valium and chase it with booze

One little taste, it'll do

Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger

If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka

Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)

That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a Benzo

I can hear the music continue to crescendo

I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window

That's when you know you're schizo (Hello darkness, my old friend)

'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel

The music is so loud

But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound

I should get ready for the show now

Wait is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact

Then something told me relax

And just hope for the show to be packed

Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max

'Cause that'd be totally wack

You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness, my old friend)

But what if nobody shows? Panic mode

'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second

'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance

Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions (Hello darkness, my old friend)

The press is about to go ape shit bananas on all the networks

Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers

I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed

Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser

Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the Scope

I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds

With them benzodiazepines gone

Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor

Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore



People start to show up, time to start the show up (Hello darkness, my old friend)

It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up

And I'm already sweatin' but I'm locked and loaded

For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers

Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere

As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel

Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze

Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner

With no prior convictions, so loss, the sky's the limit

So my supplies infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier

Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences

Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches

(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance

Guess show time is over

No suicide note, just a note for target distance

But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this

You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea

I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness

Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked

'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

(Hello darkness, my old friend)



Yeah, we do have some breaking news from the Associated Press right now, just gonna bring that up because we are hearing we have told you that the shooter is dead and we have just learned that police are saying that the Las Vegas shooter killed himself

That is the bartender there at Mandalay Bay and I believe we're going to hear more

Yeah, we just wanted to share that with you, you can see behind me here, this is what he looks like, now we did just tell you that police just earlier, Metro was telling us that he killed himself inside the hotel room"

You dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see

'Fore you die cussin'

My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)

Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)

Bunch of dogs gonna tryna dry hump it

Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""

Pile the carnage up 'til its so high, it's touching the sky

Let 'em all line up and attack

Single filing up in the stack

Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)

'Cause they just wind up on their backs

Now the sky's nothing but black

But I am not coming back, I done told ya

I told the woke me to go to sleep

But still, they keep on provoking me

They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally

But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke

When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now



I'm leaving Heaven

I'm leaving Heaven

Angels won't find me

Where are you going?



I've been down, kicked

Like around six thousand times since I was a kid

As a child, picked on, clowned

Countless times I've been outed

Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)

So the route I went's self-empowerment

In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it

And balance it with talents, wit

'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)

'Cause it's only one percent

Who overcome the shit they've underwent

I went AWOL like what my back was up against

Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it

I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked

Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle

And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah

But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment

Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks

But I swore I'd get them back

Even if it meant selling my soul to get revenge and (What?)

Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking

If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it

That’s part of the reason I do all my talking when He can

And as long as I'm breathing I vow to smother and beat them

Got a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even

Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end

This evil is calling, I'm already seething and



I'm leaving Heaven

I'm leaving Heaven

Angels won't find me

Where are you going?



Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)

I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)

Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep

Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see

If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat

If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece

Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips

We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split

We'd do backward flips, looking back at it

I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit

Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit

Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit

Yeah, which brings me back to the real dad that I zero had

Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab

Just to hear them words, ear piercing

Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring

Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died

Me? Tear no shed

Should I have made a mural at your funeral?

Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?

Where the fuck you were at

When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?

Never met your grandkids, fucking coward

Only gut you had was from your stomach fat

I couldn't see your ass gonna Heaven

So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell

So I can whip your fucking ass

I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face

No coming back from where I'm going

Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel

Dig with the blade up, and then I step on the metal

Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil



I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)

I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)

Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)

Where are you going? (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)

I'm leaving heaven (Fuck you, bitch)

I'm leaving heaven (You know what? Maybe if I had had you)

Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)

Where are you going? (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")

('Cause I wouldn't have been me)



So you better, you better run (Yeah)

You better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)

You better, you better run (Cocksucker)

You better, you better run (See you in Hell)"

I'm the king of the blood sport, all mice

I'm from an era, you had beef? You prolly fist for it on sight

Get your ass beat on the basketball court on Spike

Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice

I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister

Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em

Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison

Used to beat the battle to neck with damn militants

Spillin' over fabulous jams my man Dilla sent

Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist

I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern

That brother you spoke of, it just wasn't his dope, was it?

I'm coke buzzin', I never been low budget

The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it

I break free like Chesimard

Keep 'em guessin' hard while my broad say my bars just like ASMR

All my dogs is at the reservoir

Live at the edge of darkness and light

One phone call my and my youngins takin' flight

They call me five to nine, and thought duh-dun, duh-dun

Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em

Leave these pussies stretched out, like the Octo-Mom

Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times

I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's

When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly

Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird

'Cause you put it up in the sky

And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column

I'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall

And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you like a vagina problem

To a diabolical gynecologist, tryna ball a fist I will

Fuck you just buy me, double timing the rhyming

I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly

I'ma show you what I mean when they call me the Harvey Weinstein of 2019

I'm a conniving, when I'm on the mic I'ma standout

Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out

Me and this game, we got married already

Had the prenup ready, fuck, all that's ever seen her belly

She barely was three months pregnant

Bitch had to give me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly

(This song's about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad



One thing that sticks in my craw

When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom

Socked her right in her eyeball

I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic

With all the pictures that I draw of

Shit that I already witnessed, this probably twisted my thoughts

All I can hear is drama with mom and him

I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways

The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm

My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard

Doctors had to put it down

He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!



I, I, hate

My, my stepdad (Stepdad)

So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)



Outside, I look like I'm calm

Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb

'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)

Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on

But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him

Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times

He swatted me with it, I'm cryin'

He just started hittin' me harder

God, I just wish I could jaw him

If I could get my weight up

But I'm just a second grader

This prick is bigger than I am

But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide

I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time

Sneak up with a lethal injection

And put him down like they did to my dog

I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan

This fuckin' shit's like Saigon

Neighbors called police on him

So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium ion

Then mom and him let bygones (Bygones)

Just be bygones

So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off

But this why I



I, I, hate

My, my stepdad (Stepdad)

So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)



So this year, I'm goin' to the fifth and I'm tall

I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got

Way bigger fish to fry

Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off

The hand'll wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box

He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan

So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons

I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'

He walks by, kicks my arm and goes ""Whoops"" and just laughs

I yelled for mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense

I stood up and said, ""Fuck you punk"" and I took off and ran

To my bedroom, as I fled

Knowin' shit would hit the fan

Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat

He kicked it in

I swung it hard as I could at his head

His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed

I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear

I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass

Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad

""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his

Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter with

Then buried him next to my dog

And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em



I, I, hate

My, my stepdad (Stepdad)

So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

'Cause I, I, hate

My, my stepdad (Stepdad)

So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)"

Ha! I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit?
Checked in at the Royal Garden

To chill and avoid my problems

Until paranoia caused me to feel like I'm going bonkers

For real, think my toilet's talkin'

I spilled like, like forty bottles of pills

Think your boy is startin' to feel like a spoiled carton of milk

'Cause it just occurred

My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fuckin' bitch to the curb

But the word ""fuckin'"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word

The type of bitch she is ain't no adjective, it's a verb

Ho thinks her snatch is magical but that's how she attracts men and who traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid

Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow

In fact it'll be nothing to throw that lil' Bitch with a capital B at the back window out the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo

When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet

A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll

Been fire bitch, I can't outrap Reynolds

Apparently it'll be great but a napkin'll do

Return of the whack sicko

Head spinnin' like invisible scratch pickles

Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal

It's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a Louisville slugger and crapped it, I'd like to introduce myself

Hi there, bitch my name is-



My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)

S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)

Call me extra, extra terrestrial

Extra, extra, extra terrestrial



I could keep beefing

Fuck is the point?

I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit

If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L

I'd rather just see you in hell but I should get puff on the joint (Diddy)

Wait, run it back, I said gave you an L, in hell

Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid

Used to get jumped for my poems

When I was growin' up they said a slinky's a wonderful toy

My mother thought I was such a fun little boy

""Oh, what a bundle of joy!""

Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin

From the tantrum I was throwing

Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee, I don't cut the beat till I fuckin' destroy it

Once I get going rain thunder it's storming

Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice

In my head said it's still a dream

Then he said kill emcee's

Trippie Redd, with pills on lean

Sippin' meds in the limousine

Getting head, guillotine



My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)

S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)

Call me extra, extra terrestrial

Extra, extra, extra terrestrial



Yeah

So all of y'all can just suck a penis (Suck a penis)

I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)

Eat you pussies like cunnilingus (Like cunnilingus)

When that kamikaze hits (When that kamikaze hits)

Now they call me ""Butter fingers"" (They call me ""Butter fingers"")

'Cause I just keep droppin' shit (I just keep droppin' shit)

You wanna butt heads?, shut up Beavis, ha ha

I got your bitch with her butt out

I'm hittin' a lick and she stickin' her tongue out

You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out

She 'bout to give up the dug out

I should just live in a nut house

Right now, I live in an igloo (Yeah)

And I'm not chillin' the fuck out

Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and

Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man

I'm a stan of Redman, X-Clan and I'm a Treach fan

But I look up to myself (Yeah)

Like a fucking headstand (Yeah)

So why, w-w-why else, would I call myself an alien

How could I hit a dry spell (Yeah), I'm named after the wet lands



I'm Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)

S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural

Call me extra, extra terrestrial

We were inseparable at one time, yeah

You know my love for you was undying, yeah

You used to always have my back



Some days it feels like you're all that I have

That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can

And you just want me for my money so I got you wrapped all in saran

Damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand

But if not for my financials

I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample

Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull

Myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful

I can only take so much of you all at one time

Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes

Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side

I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest

Yeah, baby we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious

Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives

Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis

Such a wide range of emotions

Migraines, but why the fuck am I takin' these MOTRINs?

Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean

And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken

But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it



I'll never love again

The way I loved you

Did you find someone new?

Are you doin' this with them?

'Cause I remember when

Still remember when you was mine, yeah

We were inseparable at one time, yeah

You know my love for you was undying, yeah

You used to always have my back



So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you

Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality

Somehow it seems like when I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep

You're bound to creak

'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me

You're my Xanax and my valium, I'm an addict you're a downer

You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet

But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof

A scoundrel and fiends how I feel around you

Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket

Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through

Everything that we've gone through

How many times you've fucked me

But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you

Swore my fealty, but word to G.O.D

I thought you loved me, but you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you

Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to

The Ambien and Tylenols too

Fuck all you



Fuckin' bitch

We're done"

Much as I fight to restrain

I have the right to remain violent

Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you

Icicle veins, mics will get slain

Life it will strangle you with bicycle chain

You're gonna have to come identify the remains

Wait, what?

I said my head is twisted like a red tie (Yup)

Can't get a fuckin' word in, edgewise (Shut up)

Success overnight like a red eye (Bitch)

Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy from the Westside

I'm hot dog, no you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar, admires

And the appliances like washers and dryers

Chick ran up like, ""Marshall, you're fire""

I looked down and said, ""No, I'm not, you're a liar""

She said, ""No, your music""

Heard you're back with the Dr. and I heard

A mic in my hand's a weapon (What?)

I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land

Too fly, I don't plan to ever Cinderella Man

What I am is better than

Every single one of you

You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd fuck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work

You're still a cunt

I'm still a fucking jerk

Same as it ever was, yeah

Say it'll change but it never does

Ain't gonna ever 'cause

You're the cause of my pain and the medicine

Never met someone who played games with my head as much

Fate tethered us together like two felons

Must've fell in love with skeletons

Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but

Feels like I slept with the wicked stepmother

But how the hell am I

Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of

They say love the one you quit

But this shit is killing us

I lust on some other shit

I'm a glutton for punishment

You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts

It's above and beyond us

Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven

If I catch you sucking another dick

You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again

Why am I tucking you in?

Probably 'cause



I gotta tell myself another lie

'Cause that's what helps to get me by

'Cause I'm in Hell

This is my goodbye, farewell



Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you

Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you

Wanna heal you, yeah

Wanna lose you, keep you bruised

You be the abuse you treat, you mutual

It's juvenile, delusional, it's usual

You're beautiful, I'm average

I'm brutal, you're a savage

My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising

Yeah it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick

Though we might get along like shit

Fight, hit, fight, spit, unite, split

Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine

And they say love is blind, we see each other fine

But it's no wonder, I'm the only one you'll find

To put up with your shit, I need a plumber line (Yeah)

But nothing comes to mind besides a number 90

'Cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down

Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now

Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows, make it rain upwards

We're on the ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds

I should fly south, 'cause man am I great and land in myself

But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm outtie five thou'

But this is my house, bitch you get out

Then we duke it out, then it dies down

Then we say, ""Fuck it"", cry our eyes out

Then...



I gotta tell myself another lie

'Cause that's what helps to get me by

'Cause I'm in Hell

This is my goodbye, farewell



This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be

Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts

'Cause that's what attracts us

Trick you with a back rub

Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub

Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic

But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us

I love you but I won't exchange vows

Hey now, don't get carried away

No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wet us

Yeah, but we're so insane about each other

May take the same route and way out as junior stay out

Break out Berettas lay down in bed and blow our brains out together

Who knows how it's gonna play out?

A weathered desk where our ending would be

One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee

But I go to bat for you, defending your honor

Yeah, no contingency fees, something will not knock

We're not pretending to be, don't cost a penny to be with me

Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke

Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing

Could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine

Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea

Guess I'm a prisoner see, addiction is a disease



I gotta tell myself another lie

'Cause that's what helps to get me by

'Cause I'm in Hell

This is my goodbye, farewell

Yeah, they miss the old me

I think they want me to OD on codeine

They want my life in turmoil like in '03

They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds

They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding

I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking

I'm rippin' out of my clothing

I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (Yeah)

Never took much to convince Dre

Never been swayed by color or skin shades

All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from

But it's happening again, huh?

Y'all used to be in my corner

Now you just backed me in one

Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some

For some adversaries, I carry big guns

So some targets'll get the kill shot

Some, I just barely nicked 'em

I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump

Or sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit

Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt

Shoulda never made a response to the disdain for the fake ones

Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts

They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once

And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'

And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'

For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'

But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'

Weapon never unholstered without firin'

My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion

They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle

'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars

But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards

Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on

Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an ant hill

They wanna put my style to the test, am I still

The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill

Oh yeah, a bar at will

And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still

The truth for real, I'm real truth, call that treal

Tear to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain

Elite beat boxer minus the raps

Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?

Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented

The nigga gotta send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks

Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever

I see you, my niggas call me the enemy watcher

The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya

I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher

I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater

More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka

God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead

They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head

'Cause I said motherfuck school and instead went to special ed

Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time

That I startled my mom and had her scared to death

Word to Method Man

She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio

She was like, ""What the heck was that?""

She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck

Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""

Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel

Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always

Rejoice in the sound of my voice, bitch, you don't have a choice

Just a third of my will will overpower yours

Using about a fourth to create the amount of force

It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylen— or

Enter my house of whores with a thousand floors

Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns

But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store

I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse

Than a fourty-some bar Lord Jamar verse

Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse

You could say I swore to protect

My image I have zero time or regard for

I never was, been claiming rap when it's not yours

If it was anyone's house G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors

Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks

Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link

Rest of these youngins of mine

Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds

'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why

I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just suns in my eyes

Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it

Next door to an abortion clinic

Newborn infants tortured and tormented

With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented

Their corpses get ornamented

The corner where the store has been rented

To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'

Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending

This is only the beginning

So Lord forgive me, I'm hearing voices

I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning

I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you

To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse

Shit-list renewed so get shit to do

Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' t-to

Everyone copies though? Probably no

Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios

I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though

Not even dissin', it just ain't for me

All I am simply is just an emcee

Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea

Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean

Maybe I need to stir up shit

Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me

Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill

I should eat a pill, probably I will

Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death

I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath

Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed

Bang it with a pipe wrench

While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch

Like vice-president Mike Pence

Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip

These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic

Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and

Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)

You will never see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C

I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze

And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it

Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)

Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough

Nah, turn the valium up!

'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut

Now when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at

I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks

You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?

And now he wants to take it out on us."" (ooh-ooh)

But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy

Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study

It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)

I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that

I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry

Especially an effing Recovery clone of me

So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy ‘zae

Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne

I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name

I'm fed up with being humble

And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings

I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach

I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo

The era that I'm from will pummel you

That's what it's comin' to

What the fuck are you gonna do? Where you runnin' to?

I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two

And dump on you if you ain't Joyner

If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner

I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it

I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper

You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's

But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival

But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider

Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned

And you would have bought it

But sayin' I no longer got it

'Cause you missed the line and never caught it

'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it

'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest

With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist

And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless

What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest

Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it

Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic

With a bottle full of malt liquor

But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer

The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom

If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet

I don't see why y'all even started with me

I get impeached, my enemies die

I don't ceasefire 'til at least all are deceased

I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'

Now you see why I don't sleep

Not even a wink, I don't blink

I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats

I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze

""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage

The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""

Shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all

If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine

Or you think water is pink

""Dawg, that's a date,"" ""Looks like an olive to me.""

""Look, there's an apple!"" ""No it's not, it's a peach!""

So finger-bang, Pootie Tang

Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang

Charlamagne gonna hate anyway

Doesn't matter what I say

Give me Donkey of the Day

What a way for 2018 to get underway

But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say

Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)

Invite them in like a One A Day

I'm not done (preach)

'Cause I feel like the beast of burden

That line in the sand, was it even worth it?

'Cause the way I see people turnin'

Is makin' it seem worthless

It's startin' to defeat the purpose

I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds

And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word

Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict

Or still yet to be determined?

'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship

But if I could go back I'd at least reword it

And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent

Sold the dream to that he's deserted

But I think it's workin'

These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous

And he's too scurred to answer me with words

'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered

But I know at least he's heard it

'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service

To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him

Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists

I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.""

But my beef is more media journalists

(Hold up, hold up, hold up…)

I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist

Can get a mouthful of flesh

And yes, I mean eating a penis

'Cause they been pannin' my album to death

So I been givin' the media fingers

Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh

But they been puttin' me through the ringer

So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press

But I just took this beat to the cleaners"

You say we're cut from the same cloth

But I guess you fabricate, eh?

You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints

Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay spray

At anything that may stand in their way

As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade

And a tre eight, at the Mandalay Bay

Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late

James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee

Must have missed my cat-scan that day

I just threw a Tampax at Dre

Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray

I'm turning back to a madman, can't take

Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage

My basic alias is an A to the K

Get your ass spayed like bidets breakin’ your legs

Ain’t givin' ways ankle the ways you chumps don’t

Even know how to do somethin'

To give goosebumps a day when you say

That somethin' you won't give someone a lump in their throat

If you had them choked up you’d be yankin' my chain

Feelin' like I'm headed for a padded cell, the

Guess that's the standard I'm held to

But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya

You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure, then you better take it back to the shelter

And Hamburger Helper, 'cause damn it I'm still the—



Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world

No lie, I might be

So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)

Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)

Wait, what was I just about to say?

Oh yeah, let me get this out the way

I know there's people that are pissed about the way I misprounouced a name: ""DIE ANTWOORD!""

Fuck, I still can't say the shit

But how quickly they forget who the fuck I was

Now Ninja try to duck my slugs to let ya girl get fucked by Muggs

I'd like to give a shout to Cypress

This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to

Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book!

No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers

I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it

God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window

Somebody better child-proof it

'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit

And I can remind motherfuckers I'll do shit

You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit, I bullshit you not

Y'all fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts

And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop

So you call it a nostril 'cause it's not… gonna ever

I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop

'Cause I'm wipin' everyone up in this genre

Oh yeah and one more thing I want to mention

Is you're one dimension

I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention

I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention

Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension

And you just stuck the key up in the ignition

And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)

Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft

I just slapped Vlad with a ISIS flag

Bet you I come back twice as bad (uh)

Revival didn't go viral!

Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road

Fuck that, I'm finna hit back

'Til I run out of gun powder and split the scene

Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze

And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things

And my lips and the clips got the SIG lit like it's nicotine

Trigger me and Slim gets mean

Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes

That's why I call the motherfuckers M-16's

Float like a butterfly, I'm 'onna sting like a bee, you ain't harmin' a thing

I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing

I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules

I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose

Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food

Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you

Fuck you too, woah!



Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move

Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice

Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice



Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall

Turn my back on you all and you're finished

Back to these bullets, it's back to the job

Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'

Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'

These packs and I'm actually pumpin'

Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'

You might've went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'

I'm actually buzzin' this time

Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine

I do not fuck with you guys

If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time

I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers

Some chains and some blades in and a couple of knives

Choppers and jammies, a partridge in a pear tree

My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies

Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo)

They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)

I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno

Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo

You play your cards, I reverse on you all

And I might just drop four like an Uno

Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo

They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto

Lookin' for something that prolly can never find out

Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now

What you would nigga? You really want me tied down

I've been alone and I never needed nobody

Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down

Keep all of the money, I never wanted the lifestyle

I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now

I said ain't no love for the other side

Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)

When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope

You in the wrong cab down the wrong path

Nigga wrong way, the wrong road

Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast

I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower



I have said a lotta things in my day, I admit it

This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it

I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em

Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition

Fuck's the difference?

I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules

Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose

I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full

I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me

Fuck you think? (woo!)



I got a couple of mansions

Still I don't have any manners

You got a couple of ghost writers

But to these kids it don't actually matter

They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""

I said, ""I don't have any answers.""

'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album

It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers

And actually comin' from humble beginnings

I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning

I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""

We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling

But nothin' is stealing like anyone has any fuckin' ability

To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility

Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'

Songs about nothin' and mumble!

And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular

Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up

Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck

About the ones that were here before you to make raps, it's recap

Way back, MC's that recap and tape decks

ADAT's with the G raps and Kane's hat

We need 3 stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back

Because half of these rappers have brain damage

All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap

I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad

But in fact with a old-me at the same cat that would take that

Feedback and aim back, I need that

But I think it's inevitable

They all got button to press or a lever to pull

They give me the snap though (lil' bitch)

And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big

But you've been takin' the dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)

On the brink in a minute

Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything

With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits

I'ma sleep at the wheel again

As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent

Of another beat 'em and kill again

'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again

Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the Manidon

It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram

And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again

Levels to this shit, I got an elevator

You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker

I sound like a broken record every time I break a record

Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator

Motherfucker never got a right to be this way

I got spite inside my DNA

But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy

It's the moment y'all been waitin' for

Like California wishin' rain would pour

And that drought y'all have been prayin' for

My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw

Still the same Marshall that outlaw

That they say is a writer might've fell off

But back on that bull like the cowboys



So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move

Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice

Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"

(I don't know what’s up with these hoes, man)
Getting in relationships like this
(I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
(Yeah)

Should I look in the mirror?



I just want you to be normal

Why can’t you bitches be normal?

Always gotta be so extra

Why you always need a lecture?

My ex hates to talk, she's a texter

Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her

Wants to get back together

Said not 'til she gets her act together



She thinks I'm bein' mean and now

She starts to scream and shout

She's about to let the demons out

She don’t want to see me with other females out

I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route

She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house

In an evening gown with her cleavage out

We've been down this road too many times for me to count

And all I can think is how—



I just want you to be normal

Why can’t you bitches be normal?

Always gotta be so extra

Like a fuckin' terrestrial

Guess it comes with the territory

My ex girl, she just declared war

Therefore, I better prepare for it

I guess bein' weird's normal



And I don’t know what's got a hold of me

Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci

I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted

So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's

The first thing I think of when I wake up

And the last thing I think of before I go to sleep

Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse

I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless

No wonder we're partners

Both got hundreds of charges

Domestic disputes but we've always

Swept it under the carpet

Even when 911 gets the call that

I slipped up and busted her jaw with

A Louisville Slugger 'cause all's it

Really does is make our love

For each other grow stronger

She won me over the second she tried to run me over

Told her I'd keep it a hun'

We all but kicked her out, called her back now she's coming over

But why is she so wicked?

And how the fuck did I get so twisted?

I'm with someone that's so unlikeable and shifty

We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with

Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing

She's only mine for the time being

That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she

Tried to two-time me

And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave

How could I be so naive?

Should I leave or turn this entire evening

Into a motherfucking crime scene?



Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him

You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!

Especially when you're the one cheated first

Now the argument immediately becomes heated

You don't want me to flip, little conceded cunt

Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita

Slut, treat just like a drum, beat it

Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!

I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though

In our business your friends like to pry so

You've got 'em all under cover just like moles

Hopin' they'll come back with intel

But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral

'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go

Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone

Who the fuck's Milo?

The guy at work who drives a hi-lo

I put a tracking device on your Chrysler

And follow you while you drive home

But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown

You recognize me and had Milo

Flip me off right out the passenger side window

I hit a light pole, you skirt off

And then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretch white limo

Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo

But like a drunk bum, what do I know?

Let's sleep on it like they did Revival

I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole



Just wanna be normal

Why can't you be normal?

Yeah, I just wanna be normal

Why can't you be normal?"

What does he 'wanna be startin' somethin'?'

You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'

And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop till I get enough'

Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video?

Well he'll always be that Michael to me

And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white'

Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons

And I hope they all fucking die!

How do you like that?

And I like him, I like him a lot

I want to touch him but I can't

Excuse me, I'm taking a shit

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it, Runyon Avenue soldiers included

A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse

We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped and soaked in our youth

Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe

The death of Doody broke us in two

We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do

And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too

So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through

Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew

I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew

The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew

How to stand on they own, and I don't want to open up wounds

I just noticed that oomf was gone when we go in the booth

'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group



If I could leave this world behind

I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line

Turn to the river with you

Help me leave this all behind



I'ma wash away my sins

I'ma rinse away this dirt

I forgot to make amends

To all the friends I may have hurt

I better stop and say my grace

From that I pray that I don't fall

'Cause on the way back down I may

End up runnin' back into them all

I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones



It was never the same, and it's bothered me since

And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets

The more time goes by, the more life happens

And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities

Plus we don't say how we feel

And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in

Been with you guys thick and thin

But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends

Which reminded me Biz, ""Rockstar"" was the shit

Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit

If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did

More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it

I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is

I think of all of the trips to BET

And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with

Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features

But that's water under the bridge

But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed



If I could leave this world behind

I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line

Turn to the river with you

Help me leave this all behind



I'ma wash away my sins

I'ma rinse away this dirt

I forgot to make amends

To all the friends I may have hurt

I better stop and say my grace

From that I pray that I don't fall

'Cause on the way back down I may

End up runnin' back into them all

I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones



Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end

One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits

You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift

To these kids you no longer exist

Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch

To tiny drops, little drips

And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed

You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift, all the carnage you left

Is this the kind of karma you get

For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?

A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished

I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment

But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none

I just wish I had words

But I guess they're just are none for this

To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am

This is not how I planned for our story to end

I love all of you, man

But I just can't be the guy everybody depends

On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair

I will always be here, but that spark isn't there

And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era

I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air

I'm barely chartin' myself

Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent

To treat y'all like a stepping stone

Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road

Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up

But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live

The less is left for closure, so let's let this go

It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over



I'ma wash away my sins

I'ma rinse away this dirt

I forgot to make amends

To all the friends I may have hurt

I better stop and say my grace

From that I pray that I don't fall

'Cause on the way back down I may

End up runnin' back into them all

I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones

I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones"

We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)



I don't do Jordans and Audemars

I do explosions and Molotovs

Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed

I blow the smoke from the car exhaust

Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me

I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spyder move like C Breezy

I don't gotta hire goons

I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely

The sky is blue, the tie is new

The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy

While these dudes tryna figure out

How to do a freestyle as fly as me

I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G

Everybody doin' chick joints

Probably rob these little dudes at fist point

'Member everybody used to bite Nickel

Now everybody doin' Bitcoin

We don't got nothin' in common (no)

We don't got nothin' in common (no)

Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups

On them uppers-and-downers (woo!)

I'm into stuff like doublin' commas

Find me a brother who's solid

To count the shit up and then bust the shit down

When the cops set us up, we can flush the shit down

We can not give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic

Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower

Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff

Now you're slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics

Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts

To dropped in the park in a pile of shit

Knowledge is power, but powerless

If you got it and you do not acknowledge it

Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it

Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'

We can spit it for ya advance

I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killas (ayy)

The people you run with are thuggin' (gang)

But you're just a wannabe gunna (gang)

Like you was gonna do somethin'

Actin' like you catchin' bodies (ayy)

And you got juice, lil youngin, you're buggin'

You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery

Bitch, you ain't plugged in to nothin'

Rap God spit lyrical bullets (boom)

And gats cock, your partners better tool up

This has not to do with muscular

But have guns for sure, you better put a

Strap on, other words if you're gonna

Roll up with your (gang) you're gon' need a arsenal

'Cause this bar is over your head

So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrrt)

Oh, you run the streets, huh?

Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?

This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself

He wants to keep up his tough demeanor

So he does a feature, decides to team up with Nina

But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne

If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun

And I'm talkin' to you, but you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly

I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss

But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie

I keep on telling motherfuckers

But just in case you forgot really and need y’all memories

Jarred like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly

I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off

Like a fuckin' cocked semi Glock, demi-god

Let me put a fucking silencer on this little non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me

You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew

Obviously, I'm not gettin' through

We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, lettin' off like Remy Ma

Heavy artillery, gotta deal harsh with a harsh child

Pull a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly

Only time you'll ever say I lost

You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy

Just to try to get me off, and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick

Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city

Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy

Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me

That I'll be the most hated, though made it

So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it

'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho

But now those days are over

I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open

My code name is groper, I role play with lotion

I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan

Olé the hoes like with home-made explosives

I blow eighty holes in you

Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and

I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman

I throws Dre a Motrin, I throated Nicole

As they both there to choke and my whole plate is soakin'

I'm double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and

I stick and I turn in a rotatin' motion

Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals

Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal

I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let them lick on my genitals

I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick

A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable

That you bitches are fuckin' with, the original

I can say that me and Nickel are identical, but not us

The only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck

Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other

None comes close to skunk, bug, soldier

Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older

Sponge, mob, colder, none, rug, hoaster

Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug roaster

Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster



That's how much we have in common (yeah!)

That's how much we have in common (whoa!)

Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah!)

That's how much we have in common (yeah!)

That's how much we have in common (woo!)

Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything

You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing

I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert

Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter

Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass

I'll ride through your cul-de-sac

Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks

You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps

Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap

And ruined your welcome mat

So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it

While I T-bag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it

Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment

Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it

I'm 'bout to—



Smash into everyone, crash into everything

Back and I've just begun, ""FACK"" 2017

Fack, fack on everyone

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (wasn't)

From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I was in (was in)

Which is why I identify with the guy

Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein

Energized like a nine volt, ice cold

Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll

But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though

Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)

Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note

Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me

'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes

'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone

I don't think this typhoon's lettin' up any time soon, here I go

Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—



Smash into everyone, crash into everything

Back and I've just begun, ""FACK"" 2017

Fack, fack on everyone

Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze

Look at what I've done



I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing

There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee

That way that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air

The shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare

In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher

Each nut is the chair width of an acorn, stairlift beware of me

Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared

Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is



Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'

Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist

But somethin' here is afoot—oh yeah, it's my dick

Get the measurement stick (what?), twelve inches of wood

Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert

And I've come to pay respects

'Cause if you sleep you're fucked: other words, you get laid to rest

And I hope your butt is hurt

Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book

You got some views, but you're still below me

Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked

And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook

And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth

And you know I've always spoke the truth

You lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth

And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do

When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you

And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do

Gotta concentrate against the clock I race

Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace

Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape

Guess I got a chronic case

And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face

I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say

And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways

You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""

One last time for Charlemagne

If my response is late, it's just how long it takes

To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away

These rappers are like Hunger Games

One minute, they're mocking Jay

Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake

Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away

But all the hate I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate

I've had as much as I can tolerate

I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience

I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once

You want it, Shady? You got it!



Don't fall on my face

Yeah

Don't fall on my faith, oh

Don't fall on my fate

Light him up!

Don't fall on my faith, oh

Rrr

Don't fall on my fate

Look



Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it

Or have his body baggage zipped

The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches

And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks

Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly

Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot

Lacking with it, ""he ain't spit like this in his last shit""

Hoe, you better go back and listen

You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow up, let up

Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup

Hopin' that you rappers fall in that

Dre said, ""Hold your head up""

Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition, this is how I shot a head (pew)

Gabby Giffords, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business

Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch

It's not just 'cause you lack attention

It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sacrilegious

If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better

Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together some words, more than two letters

The fans waited for this moment

Like the feature when I stole this show

Sorry if I took forever



Don't fall on my face

Yeah

Don't fall on my faith, oh

I won't

Don't fall on my fate

Light him up!

Don't fall on my faith, oh

Ha

Don't fall on my fate

It's too easy



Just remember–I was here before you

And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you

Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew

Just what the doctor ordered

Revenge is the best medicine

Increase the dose, unleash the monster

Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches

So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em

See the show, every parasite needs a host

Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of

All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered

Time to separate the sheep from goats

And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts

When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer

A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air

Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror

That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care

But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists

On the scale it turns to minus

Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm barely gettin' started

And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone

Or I'll show you an Elvis clone

Walk up in this house you own

Brush my pelvic bone

You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote

Put my feet up and just make myself at home

I belong here, clown!

Don't tell me 'bout the culture

I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh

Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, pissed and moaned, but I'm not gonna fall... bitch!



It's too loud

Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot

It's too loud

I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck

Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man



I hop in your whip and take a sip, then I gun it

I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you run it

I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cummin'

I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you run it



I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be

You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes, but females be Rushin' me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me

Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie

Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key

Eh, I was tryna be nice

You tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa

Estas de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola



I'm an emotional wreck, weak (uh-huh), everything over-affects me (yeah)

When you joke it upsets me (yeah), you say I'm no good at sex

And you think I'm gross and unsexy (uh-huh)

I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks (yep)

You hope I choke on a Pepsi (yep)

Bitch, you was supposed to correct me! (oh)

Been textin' you since three, I still get no fucking reply

You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size

Fuck you goin' in those knee-high boots? Cut it out, bitch

I doubt that you're goin' to house sit

In that outfit, no skin-tight Levi's

Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie

Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot

You say, ""Don't come over"" 'cause you got pink eye

But I think I got just the thing, why

Don't I bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by?"

Used to be your Romeo, but we were both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope
That we'll get through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope

Would be dope, but

What kind of lengths can you go?

Pull a Vincent Van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho

To be a housewife who outright lies

She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive

I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?

She's just about my size

Hit me in the mouth twice

Guys, when someone you die for sticks a steak knife in your heart

Do you try more?

Another late night in

She stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in

And all we do's fight more

And I ain't violent

But she's goin' through my drawers to plant the K-Y in

I'm gettin' accused by a whore

Who smells like cyanides and

Who has probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight, nine men

I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens

Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win

Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in

And here's some two-ply for

When you date my friends, in order to wipe your ass

When you moved your bowels

When we renewed our vows

This the thanks I get

I'm waitin' for the date

I can hear you say, ""Marshall, what a skank I've been

And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him""

Got your tubes tied for him

Got that boob job for him

Hurts me to my core

But the pain I'm in, after you I swore

To make the gray skies in

Here comes the rays like wind

You get a pay hike, and, am I the good guy, or?

Do I just play like him and hope that he dumps you?

It's like the dream come true, just to scream ""Fuck you""

Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then

'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snakes eyes in



Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty

You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me

You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever

And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy

'Cause this ain't what love looks like

You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever

And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy

They like, ""You're the good guy,"" they like, they like

They like, ""You're the good guy"""

But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)
Why, are expectations so high?

Is it the bar I set?

My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach

A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as

Soon as I grab, squeeze

I lose my grip like the flying trapeze

Into the dark, I plummet

Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark's high

Butterflies rip apart my stomach

Knowing that no matter what bars I come with

You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow

So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis

I feel the ice cracking, because



I walk on water

But I ain't no Jesus

I walk on water

But only when it freezes



It's the curse of the standard

That the first of the Mathers disc set

Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet

Will this step just be another misstep

To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect I've garnered?

The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless

And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark

'TIl I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart

Like, ""this shit is garbage""

God's given me all this

Still I feel no different regardless

Kids look to me like as a god, this is retarded

If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive

And I try to not listen to nonsense

But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence

Mission accomplished

I'm not God-sent

Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so



I walk on water

But I ain't no Jesus

I walk on water

But only when it freezes



'Cause I'm only human, just like you

Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew

I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do

'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh



It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess

At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest

A flawed human, I guess

But I'm doing my best to not ruin your ex-

pectations and meet 'em, but first, the ""Speedom"" verse

Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast

Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?

There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm

Every album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on

And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on

But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun

Am I lucky to be around this long?

Begs the question, though

Especially after the methadone

As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground

And all that's left of my house is lawn

The crowds are gone

And it's time to wash out the blonde

Sales decline, the curtains drawn

They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind

And everyone who has doubt, remind

Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times

Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes

And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine

'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight

When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?

But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine

I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine

But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause...



I walk on water

But I ain't no Jesus

I walk on water

But only when it freezes



'Cause I'm only human, just like you

Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew

I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do

'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh



If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike

So me and you are not alike

Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""

Like a, snowman, ground up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Staying wound up is how I spend time
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pin rhymes

I just got the air about me

Like wind chimes (yeah)

Another day in the life (uh)

Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)

Now my community is gated

And I made it, and my neighbors say hi (say hi)

I'm giving them pounds, I'm upscale now

Guess it means I'm way in the sky

But I still remember the days of, minimal wage for

General labor, welfare recipients is a minor

Look at how government assistance has made ya

Adversity, if at first if you don't succeed

Put your temper to more use 'cause being broke is a poor excuse

That shit only gives you more fuel

Show them why you're you

So close, God, it's like I almost got it

But close only counts in timebombs and horseshoes

So I uni-bomb shit (tick, tick, tick)

No remorse

Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick

That's why they call me firecracker

I grew up on wick (wick, wick, wick) with a short fuse

I got some important news to report to

Anyone who thought I was done, nah, bitch, not quite

Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?



Do you still believe

In me?

Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?

I'll never forget if you turn your back on me

Now and walk out I will never let you live it down

(I'll never quit) Do you still believe?

In me?



Man I know sometimes these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice

To me, they're just ink blots

I just fling them like slingshots, and so precise

So you might want to think it over twice

When you retards can roll the dice

But beef will at least cost you your career

'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced

But this middle finger's free as a bird

New warhead-ed birth, you just forehead-ed on earth

Too short for a verse, studied his formula

Learned how to incorporate a curse

Point it towards corporate America

Stick a fork in it and turn

'Cause four-letter words are more better

Heard the world force-fed a turd to me

You're getting yours

But sometimes I overdo it

But I just get so into it

I was there consoling you when no one knew it

When your situation showed no improvement

I was that door, you walked over to it

I'm the light at the end of tunnel so people are always looking at me as they're going through it

When that tunnel vision is unclear, shit becomes too much to bear

Since ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" when I was having trouble with the snare

I'm that unrealistic prayer answered

And I'ma get you jacked up, like you're trying to fix a flat (uh), when you struggle with the spare

That double fisted bear, knuckles coupled with this pair of nuts I'm cupping

I am your fucking switch, nothing can compare



Do you still believe

In me?

Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?

I'll never forget if you turn your back on me

Now and walk out I will never let you live it down

(I'll never quit) Do you still believe?

In me?



Started from the bottom like a snowman

Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that

But my battery's low

I'm gonna need a booster in my pack

I know I always got Proof on my back

I called you a groupie 'cause I knew for a fact

My insulin ho

Homie I'm calling on you 'cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so

Give me that inkling and motivation to go



Motivation to go, Hussein with the flow

Fake fans with the two-faced that show

Let heartbeats loot, produce hate in my soul

Laying vocals two days in a row

True statement, hate to go down this road

But there's only one route to cross this bridge

So I walk in this bitch with loose chains

'Cause all my dues paid

But this booth is taking its toll

But it's never too late to start a new beginning

That goes for you too

So what the fuck you gon' do, use the tools you're given?

Or are you going to use the cards you were dealt as an excuse for you to not do shit with them

I used to play the loser victim

'Til I saw the way Proof was driven

I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet

And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets

Fanny packs, hourglasses

If time was still on my side, I'd still have none to waste

Man, in my younger days, that dream was so much fun to chase

It's like I run in place while this shit dangled in front of my face

But how do you keep up the pace and the hunger pains once you've won the race?

When that pool of exhaust is cooling off

'Cause you don't got nothing left to prove at all

'Cause you done already hit them with the coup de grâce

Still you feel the need

To go through and deal with that Bruce Willis

That blue still, that truth still

When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will

Do you still believe?"

Hook it inside your mouth, go ""HRUHHH""

Like hair extensions, extra clips

And you're scared to effin' death of it

In a pair of Sketcher, sweatshirt ripped

And hoodie black, should be strapped to a chair or stretcher

Electric, swear on every record, bitch

Finger so high in the air, I bet your senses flip

Like a barometric pressure switch

Carin' less who I offend with this

I'm at your neck like Pez dispense

Still on point and poignant

Skilled as Floyd is

And it's filled and still no filter, boy

I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy

You still ain't in the buldin', boy

I will destroy shit, even as I build it

Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison

Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it

Like what? Like a real thin joint, it

What? Comes on Quilted Northern

And what? In a built-in toilet

Yeah, bitch I told you I'm a dog (woof, woof)

I wouldn't heal with ointment

Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails

Should write a children's storybook (yeah)

Million voices in my head, but still get a little bit of thrill

And some real enjoyment

Off what? Off the feel of going in

Like? Like your bitch when she gives me brain

Like she thinks I'm dumb

Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come

'Til I feel anointed

She makes iller noises

When she's with me, must be from the Windy City

Pretty apparent, she's a M.I.L.F. when blowin' me

'Cause like Kandor and two, rippin' the condom in two, woo!

Dick is a bargain or two, now I'm gettin' blue like Kolonopins

Rude Jude I go there, you wouldn't

Well, I still have a few views, and comment on you

That has been the case since back when

You last went and threw your hat in the race

You've been trash

Stick your raps in the trash bin

Or end up in my next rhyme

You're a fuckboy, so next time

It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant

With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan, yeah!

Now watch me set it like correct time

All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex I

Clock rejects into the next life

Talkin' reckless, that is just my

Strongest suit, but you can get my

Columbian neck tie

Prostitute just climb in the Humvee and lets ride

Why you hitching at night?

I put an end to your life (sex crime)

Kidding aside, insidious vibe

Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes

But all you're getting is bribe

Ending your life to try to get you inside

Then we gon' end up spending the night

And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe

What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck

Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her

Up, binds up, cuts, slices her twice

But the muff diver must just like it rough

Fuck right in her vagina, blood

Flies up, under thighs, ugh, like a geyser, uh

Music, please

Enthusiast, of the roofie

Goal is to get a floozie inside the jacuzzi

And have a loosie, goosey as coozie is with an Uzi

But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen

Glued me be, I'm truTV, you're too PG

I'm Schoolly D, you're spoony, G

No diss there, just notice there are no similarities that we share

Besides the fact we breathe air

Happily married, to rap and I'm glad that we buried

The hatchet and patched it up

Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack

And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like...



Chloraseptic, 'septic

Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you

Pull up on the side of you

Window rolled down, profiled

And then we wonder why we see this side of you

Probably coming from the dope house

We can let you slide but your tail light is blew, out

We know you're hiding that Heidi Klum on you

And you're on another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you

And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you we be delighted to unload it

In your bedroom, walk up, and lay that taser in the side of you

What the fuck am I gonna do?

I keep telling myself keep doing like you're doing

No matter how many lives you ruin

It's for the red, white and blue

Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two

No one's ever indicted you

Why?



'Cause you're a white boy, white boy

You're a rockstar (My momma talk to me

Try to tell me how to live)

White boy, white boy, in your cop car (But I don't listen to her

Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a (big rockstar)



Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and

We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man

Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that

Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at

Why you kicking that soda can?

Pull your pants up

We bought to roll up, and

Throw your ass in the van, cuffed

You don't have to know our plan or what our intentions are

Our guns are close to our chest

You better show your hands

And put our minds more at ease

And you'll get shot in the thyroid, 'cause you might die, boy

We fighting a crime war

Here come the swine

Tryna' clean up these streets from all these minorities

That's why we call them pigstye's for

They're like eyesores to police

Talk to you like you're a piece of trash

Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me

As I kick these facts, and

Get these mixed reactions

As this beat backspins

It like we're drifting back into the 60s

Having black-skin is risky, 'cause this keeps happening

Throughout history, African-American's have been treated like shit

And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassing to be a



'Cause you're a white boy, white boy

Seems like, the average lifespan of a white man

Is more than twice that of a black life-spanner

Wonder if sometimes it has a fight scanner

I feel like checking out on life, can't escape my circumstance

I'd rather hear them say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord

Ninja, now it's better to describe banter

But that's life

Strapped, 'cause we're strapped financially

And can't find answers

We're applying for McDonald's

It seems like the only franchise that'll hire, so how can we have higher standards

As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter

We fight back with violence

But acts like that are

Black eyes on the movement

Which makes wack lives madder

At cops and cops madder

And that's why it's at a stalemate

Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops

I wonder if we hire more, black cops, the crap stops

The block is our backyard offices

Not the crack spot

Call the attack dogs off of us, man

You always act pissed off at us a traffic stop

And bad cops fuck it up for good cops

And man, stop, sending white cops, into black neighborhoods

'Cause they ain't acclimated to 'em

Like that's the way to do it

Who's seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns

And no nobody black so they act afraid of us

And that's racism

Fear to the black face gives them

A subconscious racist

Wait, why is there black neighborhoods?

'Cause America segregated us

Designated us, to an area

Separated us

Section-eight'd us

When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us

And education sucks, every days another

Freddie Grey for us, a levy breaks or fuzz

Why is it, they treat us like dryer lint?

We just want a safe environment for our kids, but can't escape

The sirens

Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies

In

The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in

The lowest classes, its like a razor wire fence

And we're trapped in, these racial biases

That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise

Every time we see a devil's face

Lions, tigers and bears oh my! More like billy clubs and

Gats

And we really love it when you think we're guilty cause

We're black

""But you kill each other, facts- you peel each

Others caps, for silly stuff like hats

Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse

While people with nothing to lose shoot each other for shoes

Fuck your republican views

Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck is the boots?

And streets act as a narrator

Don't gotta read comics

Or be that into characters, just to see that just to be black, you better be strapped, with a derringer- or be capped in America like Steve Rogers

'Cause no one overseas, these cops, and

Always see some B charges

We see them beat Rodney King and got off

So we don't need all your crooked police peace officer offerings

Just keep marching, til' we reach congress

But they gonna say you're tying to take an irrational stance cause you try to slander the flag

But somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb

So they call it a Kapernick tantrum if you don't stand for the national anthem

We raised it, you better praise it or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll

Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield

Home of the bravest still, racist spills

So the whole nation feels like a plantation field

In a country that claims that it was foundation on based on united states ideals

That had its Natives killed

Got you singing the Star Spangled Banner to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build"

So let the river run



He's coming home with his neck scratched to catch flack

Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch

On his breast jackets is sex addict

And she just wants to exact revenge and get back

It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack

She's kept track of all his internet chats

And guess who just so happens to be moving on to the next?

Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks

'Cause she loves danger, psychopath

And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that

But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back

Knife in hand, says the relationship's hanging by a strand

So she's been on the web lately

Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man

And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care

Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda' said ""Bye Suzanne"" after the first night, but tonight I am



I've been a liar, been a thief

Been a lover, been a cheat

All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me

So let the river run



One night stand turned into night stayin'

It was cold, some lights gram, y'all be hung tight and

He found out, now she feels deserted and used

'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too

Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?

It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous and suited

When it's too hurt but what you deserve is the truth

Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you

So I revert to the studio like Hole In The Wall diners

Don't have to be reserved in a booth

I just feel like the person who I'm turnin' into is

Irreversible, I prayed on you like it's church at the pew

And now that I got you I don't want you

Took advantage of my thirst to pursue

Why do I do this dirt that I do?

Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon in speech

Detergent and bleach is burned in the womb

'Cause now with her in the womb

We can't bring her in this world, shoulda' knew

To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit

Fuck!



I've been a liar, been a thief

Been a lover, been a cheat

All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me

A little one, I don't want to admit to something

If all it's gonna cause is pain

The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain

So let the river run



My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)

Denver, river run

Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)

River (ooh), we'll let the river run



Always the bride's maid, never ""The bride, hey!""

Fuck can I say? If life was a highway

The sequels are non-clay

But be swerving in five lanes

Speeds that are high, rave like I'm sliding on ice maybe

That's what I made, that came at you sideways

I can't keep my lies straight, what I made

You terminate my baby

This love triangle

Left us in a wreck tangled

What else can I say? It was fun for a while

That I really woulda loved your smile

Didn't really wanna abort

But fuck it, what's one more lie to tell an unborn child?



I've been a liar, been a thief

Been a lover, been a cheat

All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me

A little one, I don't want to admit to something (I'm sorry, I fucked up) if all it's gonna cause is pain

Girl, you're smoking like Snoop Dogg

But you must be Token if you think you're taking over my quarters

There goes the dime and the jukebox

Two shots of blue Hypnotic and soon I'll

Turn this brooha to a barroom brawl

So hit scratch on the break like the cue ball

Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox

And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw

But apparently, so are you, ma

'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off

And that's why

Said can I take you home, where we can be alone

Shawty, you the shit

Girl, I ordered you to sit

I know you're probably feeling me more than you admit

Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink

I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink

From the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling

You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million

'Cause real tits are still fun

But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones



So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of

But tonight, curiosity overrides ya

Besides ya fire (i love)

Like a starter pistol

Crystal and slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot

'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl, you're so fucking fly

You belong in the mile high club

So come on baby, the night's young

Don't string me along, I'm highstrung

We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young

Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out

Like changing a lightbulb

That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya

Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up

I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck

So ready, set, aim, and fire

Yes babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda

This is where is where terrorism and heroism meets, square up in the streets

All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats

While he looks like a canary with a beak

Why you think banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?

He's trying to divide us, this shit's like a cult

But like Johnny, he'll only unite us

'Cuz nothing drives us inside like this fight does

When we can't wear stars and stripes 'cause this type of pickle we're in is hard to deal

And band together for Charolettesville

And for heaven's fallen heroes

Can't denounce the klan, 'cause they play golf with ya

You stay on Twitter, made to get your hate off, Nazi

I do not see a way y'all differ, at all

You got a race card with a swastika with your name carved in it

Then it should be your trademark, all you did is play off

You played off, so I guess it pays to feed off of chaos

So basically, you Adolf Hitler

But you ain't ruining our country, punk

You won't take our pride from us

You won't define us

'Cause like a dictionary, things are looking up

So much, got a sprained neck

Knew we would rise up

Against this train wreck and take a stand

Even if it mean sitting when they raise the flag

This ain't the Star Spangled Banner

This man praised a statue of General Lee, 'cause

He generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics

Take it back to the Shady national convention

Wish I would have spit on him before I went to shake his hand at the event

Or maybe had the wherewithal to know that he was gonna try to

Thought he was gonna tear apart a sacred land

We cherish and stand for, so

Hands in the air, let's hear it for

The start of a brand new America

Without him, we can be proud of where we're from

And here's to where we're from



This is where it all began, all began (stand up)

Here's to the land that made me

And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)

Here's to the land that raised me

There's home for the only place that really knows me

From the cracks in the road that drove me

There's no place like home



I won't give up

I won't give up on my home, that so many died for

You already know that I won't give up

I won't give up on my home, that so many died for

You already know there's no place like home, no place like home

Wherever I go, no place like home

No place like home, no place like home

Oh, back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run

Back to the booth, jump back in the studio

Give you a tongue, lasher than you

Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb

Stoning was funny, back in our youth

But then it wasn't after we knew

That we were done and actually through (and actually through)

But if there's one fraction of truth

If it could be spun back I would do so many things different

'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse

You hit me once, and that I would use

To continue the pattern of abuse

Why did I punch back?

Girls, your dad is a scumbag

I'm confused because



How come you can be a lord and a loser

How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?

A good dad, but a bad husband

Why are you a good father

A great dad, but a bad husband?



You wouldn't beat our love with a writer's block

Just a line that's hot, that I forgot

We laughed a little, cried a lot

I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie

Day before you went to jail and daily

How we would wait for that mail lady

Or by the phone, for mom to call

And I watch you pull yourself up

And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all

You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark

I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box

When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot

Every line we crossed, we were supposed to not

Every time we fought, being stones they got

Thrown too far

Words that we said that we didn't mean

The words that we meant that we didn't say

The ones that we thought that shoulda said

Letters written that we coulda read

Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead

And had this put to bed

But I'd be lying still if I wasn't sitting here asking myself



How come you can be a lord and a loser

How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?

A good dad, but a bad husband

Why are you a good father?

A great dad, but a bad husband

(dad) (you said)

Forever be a hero in my eyes

I reply

But there's always another side to a good father

A great dad, but a bad husband



We brought out the worst in each other

Someone had to make the sparring end

'Cause I loved you but I hated that me

And I don't wanna see that side again

But I'm sorry Kim

More than you could ever comprehend

Leaving you was fucking harder than

Sawing off a fucking body limb

Once upon a time where all we had

Maybe that was what drew us to each other

It was true love shit that we never knew was possible

We might have loved each other too much

And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other

All the screw-ups

'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me

And I was thinking I was more in love than you was

For all the times that we thought it was

'Til we saw how wrong we were

When the dust settles now and all the dirt

And if I touch the rawest nerve all I want is for us not to hurt

And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words

But I just heard ""Mockingbird""

And got the urge to jot me some verses and thoughts

The purpose was not to stir up open wounds

I've caused got a few, and so have you

Or argue who's fault it was, partly yours, partly mine

But really no ones, this is so tough

I'm getting choked up

Oh fuck it, we both suck

We broke up, got back together

We both thought we had forever

Not bad people, just bad together

We was so nuts, backstab each other

Another blow struck, but there's no ducking this blow

'Cause it's over, and it's closure

But, I'm not so sure how to close this, I just don't know

How some people can be so good

At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother shit

It's no wonder



How come you can be a lord and a loser

How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?

A good dad, but a bad husband

Why are you a good father?

A great dad, but a bad husband

(dad) (you said)

Forever be a hero in my eyes

I reply

But there's always another side to a good father

A great dad, but a bad husband"

And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA

I got my hands on something great

And found a way to fuck it up again

Now I'm the one thing

You couldn't hate more

But you're the one thing

That I would die for



All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special

I don't need to be reminded of it every other second

'Specially when all my self-esteem's already shot the hell up

Falling helplessly, I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see

'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit, every time she yells at me

Selfishly indeed, but definitely doesn't help that she

Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven, but makes life a living hell for me

She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me

I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger

A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle

Until something better comes along, and she'll just drop me like a hot potato

I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay, though

'Cause I know she loves me, my friends, what do they know?



It's like I'm drowning at sea

Hoping that you reach for me

I know you're there but I can't see

'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

I'm dying to breathe

And all you do is strangle me

Such a beautiful relief

'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

Drunk off tragic endings



In my moments of weakness, I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally

I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously

Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me

It only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she

Gets going, she don't stop, when I'm up, she's like a downer

When I found her it was love at first encounter

Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton of eggs off the counter

Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for me to walk on when I'm around her

But there's just something 'bout her

That makes me not able to function without her

How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?

I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist

Make a believer out of me

And show me the way now

Or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain

'Cause I'm going straight down the drain

I'm drowning



It's like I'm drowning at sea

Hoping that you reach for me

I know you're there but I can't see

'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

I'm dying to breathe

And all you do is strangle me

Such a beautiful relief

'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

Drunk off tragic endings



Now I'm the one thing

You couldn't hate more

But you're the one thing

That I would die for



It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out

She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else

The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself

To see me falling to pieces brings her joy, brings her hell

But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say ""screw her""

I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her

She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her

Since I'm manure, she's a sewer

This time, this piece of shit's running through her

I can see that right now, I'm running to it

What the fuck? Shoulda knew it

Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?

As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid

She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it

Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it



It's like I'm drowning at sea

Hoping that you reach for me

I know you're there but I can't see

'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

I'm dying to breathe

And all you do is strangle me

Such a beautiful relief

'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

Drunk off tragic endings"

Freaky Tales (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she decals
But when murdering females better pay attention to these details

Or you could be derailed, better wear atleast three layers

Of clothing or be in jail

If you get scratched because your DNA'll

Be all up under her fingernails

Man he hears you I don't think he cares

He gives a fuck even his pinky swears

Three personalities burstin out of me please beware

Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs

She's all aware in no underwear she's completely bare

Turns around and screams I remember distinctly

I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs.""

Chop her up put her body parts in front of Steven Avery's trailer

And leave 'em there



But hey man I was framed

I know what this looks like officers please just give me one minute

I think I can explain

I ain't murder nobody I know these words are so nutty

But I'm just here to entertain

How come your shirt is so bloody?

There's a missing person, so what he's got nothing to do with me

I'm almost certain I was framed



Woke up it was dawn, must a knew something was wrong

Think I'm becoming a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on

Donald Duck's on as the Tonka Truck in the yard

But dog how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car

Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it

Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon

Me, 'cause I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde girl

That motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond

Second murder with no recollection of it

Collecting newspaper articles, cutting up sections from it

Memories to fuck to remember destructive temper cut my public defender's jugular

Then stuck him up in the blender

Another dismembered toddler

Discovered this winter probably

'Cause the disassembled body

Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly

I'm going in for questioning

Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me



But hey man I was framed

There's a missing person, so what he's got nothing to do with me

I'm almost certain I was framed



Still on the loose day

Spotted me inside McDonald's, Tuesday

In a Toronto Blue Jays cap looking like your college roommate

With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher

Or was it Cool J the cops is on a goose chase

Just escaped from the state pen for raping eight women who hate men

Don't make it no weirder I'm naked when I break in your basement

Under your babies play pen I lay and wait adjacent facing the door remaining patient

While staying complacent blatant

Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown

Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems

Left on your pillow in hopes that when you get home

You'll get the hint ho, I'm in your window

But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene

In a verse and be charged with first degree

Cause it just happened to match up perfectly

With the massacre or the Burger King burglary

No officer you see I was framed



I know what this looks like officers please just give me one minute

I think I explain

But I'm just here to entertain

Our world's on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told

We're going nowhere fast



I feel sorry for this beat

Sympathy pains for this track

This road is taking me back

Down memory lane with this rap

I can still look out in this crowd

Be wowed and be taken aback

I'm simply stating a fact

I had Wembley Stadium packed

But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and, fast

Another terrorist attack, like a tariff grows

Half of Madison Square up, alas

We perish in the blast but that doesn't scare us

We pass no one, we're fearless

'Cause we're just



Ashes blowing in the air

Our world's on fire but we don't care, yeah

Wasted youth, always on the road

Never looking back and we're never getting old

'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold

Fuck doing what you're told

'Cause we're going no, going no

Going no, going no

Going no, going nowhere

Going nowhere fast



Fuck doing what you're told, act like a two-year old

Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways

For MC's it's a funeral when I'm devising this rhyme

'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning

That's why I rise and I shine

Like a new day has dawned on me

Gusto guts bravado nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot

I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle

'Cause some stuff that's awful really don't mean nothing all though

There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow

But if at times my heart it seems like it's in the wrong place

It's probably cause it's on my sleeve

Keanu Reeves speed of life

Avoid or veer or just steer toward it

We're only looking forward but

Where we're going, we have no idea

Nowhere to go but hysterical

It's getting warm in here, I set the world on fire

Was born to be an arsonist

Just one spark and it's lit

But I'ma still get dark on this shit

Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch

War machine but you've forced me in a corner

I'm sure to have something for your ear

And in the course of the assault is torture, it's more severe

Go to war with me or end up blew to Timbuktu

I send at you a ten ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un

And end up blewn in your career

All in all, it's said and done

And at the end of my run, I just rewind clocks

Forever young, make time stop

Will I ever fall off, that day'll never come

To the Pine box, bitch fuck you

I'm better than I ever was

'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does but

I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause this

World's screwed, it's already fucked and I'm on top

So everyone's just



Ashes blowing in the air

Our world's on fire but we don't care, yeah

Wasted youth, always on the road

Never looking back and we're never getting old

'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold

Fuck doing what you're told

We're going nowhere fast



'Cause we're going no, going no

Going no, going no

Going no, going nowhere

Going nowhere fast



You can't tell us nothing

Hard-headed and we're stubborn

So, one ear and out the other we're young

Who knows what the future for us could hold

Another shooter, uh oh

no more tomorrow's we're done

And all we are is



Ashes blowing in the air

Our world's on fire but we don't care, yeah

Wasted youth, always on the road

Never looking back and we're never getting old

'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold

Fuck doing what you're told

We're going nowhere fast



'Cause we're going no, going no

Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass cheek implants, call that an asset
Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive

From the first time I saw you I actually said to myself, ""I gotta meet her like a taxi""

Exactly, love affair in the backseat

Sorry if I'm being graphic, but I'm stiff as a statue

You sat on a shelf, I feel like I'm a bust

Maybe I'm just ahead of myself

Let me slow down, slow your Camaro

I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna' jump your bones to the marrow

Got me under your control and your spell

Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow

Grab you by the (meow), hope it's not a problem in fact

About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that

So when I put this palm on your cat

Don't snap, it's supposed to be grabbed

Why do you think they call it a snatch

I just wanna climb in the sack

I'ma keep it 100, like my speedometer's at

I'm watching you rap, I'm the dude following in back

About six cars back, I'm in the lac

And I want to (uh)

Me too, you're burning up

Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store

But them jeans you wore, like I've never seen before

I pretend to work there, while I clean the floor

Checking you out, like the clerk, while he rings you up

Pull up behind you while you're leaving and you don't even know it (ayo, Rick, man)

She's brushing her hair, adjusting her mirror

She's rapping my shit, but she wasn't aware

I was there, or maybe she was, and just didn't care

Who knows, at least that isn't up in the air

It's something to see

So like a chick who thinks her coochie doesn't stink

If she ain't planning to do shit, this summers eve

Maybe she wants to keep me company

But fuck the Pepe Le Pew shit

""Ain't stepping to you bitch"", I say to myself

Plus she's bumping my music, and chasing no tail

Like a skunk in heat

I could sweat her, to some degree

But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me

Let her come to me, male sweater, some degree, fail

Fuck it, pull up beside her

Side swipe her, Dodge Viper

What is a brighter ass if she wants a computer

Lodged up her vagina

Said my dick is an Apple

She said ""put it inside her""

I said

You ask, I stay the night

With you, you say you're vile

Me too, you're burning up

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat



Black out, come to, hands covered in blood

Motherfucking gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud

I just bodied the beat, so that hoe must've been dug

Cause it just died like ""ooh, food coloring, duh""

So let's get turnt, like a shish kebab, twist it Ma

Like an Air Conditioning knob

We be great together

Don't care if it takes forever

If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never

You felt my heat, rubbing off on you

I love your personality

Come on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt Rick's beat

Come jump in the water, I bet you get yourself a stream

From your persona

With an ass to match, girl your body is lit

You're striking, I'm a gas

Girl, you're just gonna have to put the mother chumps on the back burner

You got puns, I got asperger's

Decided to rest my head in between that set of Ds

While I shred MC's, like cheddar cheese

That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed

My dog thinks so too, look at my pedigree

Ma, the world is what I think of you

I think you're divine, so I might swing on you

I'm just kidding girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two

Unless it's the middle one, to finger you



All day, all day, all night

You ask, I stay the night

With you, you say you're vile

Me too, you're burning up

I'm running



Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat



On the ones and twos, threes and four in (the morning)

You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted

Probably let it fall and hit the pavement

But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it

Bitch, stop bein' a lame



Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs

Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells

And chainsawing them in the basement

Hardly fits your job description

Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'""

Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it

'Cause you're only gonna make things worse

I hope you offended

'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up

'Til everybody eats my turds



These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me

Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery

Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam

I'm gettin' handys with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest

I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs

From a daddy longleg

And Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera

Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat

I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic

With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent



Twice your age and I'm actin' half it

Grow up? Nah

Not that I know of, y'all

Basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed

Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball

Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal

While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal

You're so appalled (Em), so's my manager

Bitch I'm amateur, fuck a pro career

Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here

And nobody's close, so don't compare

They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here

My competition can't see me

'Cause I don't own a mirror

But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted

I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it

Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it



Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs

But I made strides with these rape lines

I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes

Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes

Bang, bang, bang, bang time

Dang knives to butcher them gay wives

You're gonna need sutures the same size

As the blade I push into captcha

Pull 'em like... sleigh rides

Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times

To make it on Dateline

I came to stake my claim like a canine

Waitin' in a buffet line

So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre

Come play, belly dance on me

I've been making wedding plans all day



'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me

They want me to go eat some worms

Eight year old with the wordplay

Girl, take this pole like a survey

Today wasn't my birthday

But I'm caked up like a dessert tray

So we're in shape

'Cause you're in a slurrin' state

I'm a ten, you're an eight, like what I do before, after, and during rape

You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?



And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him

R. Kelly with a full bladder

Not in high school, grad, I'm not a scholar

But I'm so cold that I'm droppin' out with my degrees

It's the same as I got in college

(Zero)

But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect

I owe you nada like lodi partner that blow me

Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water

With some floaties on

And get the soap, and try to get the Pope to hold me

While you hose me off And nope I won't be washed

You hope to God I don't explode, I gotta blow this spot up, though

I got a lotta more



I won't put the sugar coating on it though

'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired

Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped

You feel like a wet pile of crap

But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh

I get why you're tapped

But you gotta get your fire back

Catch fire, get upset and fire back

Is what I tell myself

When times get bad

'Cause sometimes I might get sad

Well I take the same advice I had

And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag

Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad

'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags

I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me

I'm right in your ass

'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)

You ain't have to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude

Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain, it's rised too high to count it



Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted

But then I think about it and I'm enraged

'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid

For the time I spent to put the pen to the page

It'd be minimum wage

But it's embedded in my head and I never hunted for the bread and butter

What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of

But I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen

And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal

Or forget I was ever this incredible

I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get

Another mothafuckin' opportunity again

To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can



'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me

They want me to go eat some worms

I hope you offended

And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt

But I'ma make you eat your words

I hope you offended

You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up

'Cause you're only gonna make things worse

I hope you offended

I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?

Oh, what I wouldn't do for you



And I'm starting to think maybe you need me

Maybe you need me

Maybe you need me

And I'm starting to think maybe you need me

Maybe you need me

Maybe you need me



Some nights I want to run for the hills

It's never easy with you

I cannot reason with you

But your smile is as rare as it comes

What would I do without that

Maybe that's why I come back

Oh, what I wouldn't do for you



And I'm starting to think maybe you need me

Maybe you need me

Maybe you need me

And I'm starting to think maybe you need me

Maybe you need me

Maybe you need me



Starting to think we were made for each other

But one of us in this relationship is raising the other

You remind me of my mother

We drive one another as crazy as each other

And we're both adults so there's no excuse for the games that we play with each other

Where you at? At a friends?

No you ain't, motherfucker



But I give her the benefit of the doubt

Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver

When I touch her, 'cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker

Our bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble, she's in hot water

Think I caught her cheating again

Give her another chance? Another one after that?

I'm swimming in that Egyptian River cause I'm in denial

Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eating grin when I smile

Making an excuse for us to act it out

She's just acting out, with her inner child

Then I set the truth on fire

Cause I'd rather believe a lie then breathe a sigh of relieve that I don't believe in

Going to bed mad

I keep on trying to make a bad girl good

But haven't I stood by you in good times?

And bad? I'm starting to feel like you're god damn dead

'Cause I literally feel like you could die of a ""should I?""

Leave me for good? You never would

Never understood why they call it goodbye



But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy

And you're a good person, too

I can save you, I can make you change

But I keep putting my fuckin foot in my mouth

Every time I gotta come to bail you out

When you get in trouble that you get yourself in

I miss trouble but I can't leave

I'll sell you out! I could never turn my fuckin' back on you

What is that?



I'm co-dependant, I'm just now noticing it

But somehow it's like every time I go to end it

I don't have the cahoney's to do it

Nor the heart, uh, department store

You're using my heart for a dart board

But God must've had a non-stop score

'Cause somebody paired us up

But people say he ain't capable of making a mistake

But this one's perfect

'Cause I'm...



And I'm starting to think maybe you need me

Maybe you need me

Maybe you need me

And I'm starting to think maybe you need me

Maybe you need me

Maybe you need me"

Smoke shit in the cars

I can fit and I'm just driving as far as I can get

Away from these problems, to all my sorrows I forget

What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm starting life again

Kids in the corner won't stop fucking my ignoring

Besides psycho when I fantasize

Starting my whole life over, yeah right

Oh and I might go and

Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one

I try to look alive because there's nothing like

Holding your head up high when you're dead inside

And I just hide so in, case you're wondering why my insides showing

'Cause I done spilled all my guts and know some minds so I'm

Picking them up and stuff them in the back

Fuck it I've done enough in this rap shit, Recovery> brought me nothing

But back, to where I was and perhaps, this could've been my victory lap if I wasn't on the verge of Relapse

What's in your head, in your head

Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh



It seems to be the reoccurring main thing

The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen

I went from an irate teenager to still raging

Is it though amazing, back then I put eight thing

Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy, or angry

I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it

Blame me, I did itdid what?Hailie

Baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty

Percent, of what I rapped about

Maybe, I should've did a better job at separating

Shady, and entertaining, for real life, but this

Dang thing, is still the hardest thing to explain

Is the crazy, or should I?

Ever seen it back then, it was like I ain't even

Bother to taken into consideration

You and [?] baby and older and make, hear me say things

I did it, pay me, and be, it just ain't me

Okay, so ladies and gentlemen [?] berate everything

Is the main reason that I, feel like a lame piece of shit

Or should I start cranking in bitter

Come playing beef and pick up by the same things

'Cause when I, look at me, I don't see what they see

I feel the same greedy and lately I've been contemplating

Escaping to get a ranger or whatever this road takes me

It's making me crazy, what's in my?

This is your song



You'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon

I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you

I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy

That's all that matters for the time being

But obviously, assuming you will be, just thinking ahead

I'ma make it if it kills me

Let's see how far I can take it with this music

I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion

Sorry for sloppy writing

The pen in my hand's shaking, please excuse me

Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited

If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em

With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm

As I'm using in this letter maybe they can feel me as I'm

Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl

For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl

Welcome to mom and dad's crazy world

Love, daddy

Maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got

Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are

Sorry for that, a little minor mishap

But you'll grow into 'em baby

I'm on the grind now

I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters and studios

While I'm tryna keep the lights on

Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?

I just keep steering

I'm gonna turn into someone

I haven't the slightest clue what I'm gonna do if it falls through

You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon

My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes

They're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too

Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh

I think I might have just stumbled onto something new

Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping it's you

Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain

A lot's happened in between 'em, since I rised to this fame

I've said your name but always tried to hide your face

This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you but damn

I never knew it'd be like this

If I did I wouldn't have done it

You ain't asked for none of this shit

Now you're being punished?

Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public

I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it

I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it

One-hundred percent finished

Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it

Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know

That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold

And, if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote as a goodbye note

'Cause your dad's at the end of his rope

I'm sliding down a slippery slope

Anyways sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepy

Love dad

Shit, I don't know"

One day for every pill, or percocet that I ate
Cut down on the valium, that'll hurt everything
But death is turning so definite, wait
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, being, didn't want you to know I was struggling

Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine

Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning



Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess

It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me

And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday

Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai

And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts

But, girls, you can just open 'em, dad ain't making it home for Christmas

Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss

I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff

I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout

My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not allowed



You put your arm around mama, the karma, wow

I just thought about the aisle, I'll never get to walk us down

Never see you, graduate in your caps and gowns

It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?

I've got so much more to do, and Proof, I'm truly sorry

If I let you down, but this tore me in two

The thought of no more me and you

You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school

Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded

So many things, time, I'd give anything to rewind it

I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded

By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause



That image burned in my brain of you on the table

Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you

God, why did you take him?

I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?

Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother

Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other

I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory

And I know you'll never forget me, just don't get sad when remembering

And, little bro, keep making me proud

You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down

And when you're exchanging those sacred vows, just know that if I could be there

I would and should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it

Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too

I actually learnt a lot from you, you taught me what not to do



And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance

To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk to you

Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you

And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room

Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out

Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down

Girls, please don't get upset, I see them cheeks soaking and wet



As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let

Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks

With every second, each closer to death

But suddenly, I feel my heart begin to beat slow

Then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)

Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit

I'm tryna rewind time like a tape, find an escape

Make a beeline, try and awake

From this dream, I need to re-find

My inner strength, to remind me

Even if a steep climb I must take

To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape



(I don't want it)

I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it

One hundred percent finished, fed up with it

I'm hanging it up, fuck it

Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know

That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold

And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't

I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet

Shred these old letters I wrote

All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll



I'm proud to be back, I'm 'bout to, like a rematch

Outdo Relapse

With Recovery, Mathers LP2

Help propel me to victory laps

Gas toward them and fast forward the past

Consider the last four minutes as

The song I'd have sang to my daughters

If I'd have made it to the hospital

Less than two hours later, but I fought it

Came back like a boomerang on 'em

Now a new day is dawning, I'm up, Tuesday, it's morning

Now I know"

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search

Maybe I needed to grow up a little first

Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt

But I am coming for closure

Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for

The way that you turned your back on me

Just when I may have needed you most

Oh, you thought it was over

You can just close the chapter

And go about your life, like it was nothing

You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine

I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha

'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered

Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice

Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: ""let it go, fuck this""

Heart is saying: ""I will once I bury this bitch alive

Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset""



[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]

I flee the scene like it was my last ride

You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time

You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good

And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy



[Verse 2]

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch

To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit

Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?

Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch

Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit

Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!

You left our family in shambles

You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed

Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten

And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long

That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya

You're wrong and that shit was rotten

And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go!

Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?

Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to

Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing

Letters, you don't respond to 'em

Fuck it, I'm coming to see you

And gee who better to talk to than you?

The cause of my problems

My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you

Poof, then I'm gone



[Hook]

I flee the scene like it was my last ride

You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time

You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good

And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy



[Verse 3]

I've been driving around your side of this town

Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now

Finally I found your new address, park in your drive

Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life

And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva

My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house

See, it's sad it came to this point

Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya

But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology

Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek

So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window

Like I reach my full potential, I peaked

Continue to peep, still bent low

Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo

Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch

Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this

You don't plan for intruders before hand?

Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?

Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung

Like you picked up an axe up and then swung

Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk

By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?

Now who's a faggot, you punk?

And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck

It's just me, you and the music now, Slim

I hope you hear it we are in a car right now

Wait, here comes my favorite lyric

I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die

And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP

Just to try to get people to buy

How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun

Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done

Eminem killed by M&M

Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials

I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it

Since you love you're city so much

I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here

Two more exits, town is quite near

I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear

That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea

As cops appear in my driver side mirror

(Oh, God, Police!! Ah!)

Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least

New plan Stan

Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car

Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you

Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can swim good!

Now say you hate homos again!



[Verse 4]

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend

I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in

I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen

Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin

No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in

When they say all of this is approaching its end

But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again

Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds

Toilets clogged, Yeah cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up

But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas

After the track is demolished

I am your lack of a conscience

I'm the ringing in your ears

I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils

Eating your vocal chords after your concerts

I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged

Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow

I'm the bullies you hate, that you became

With every faggot you slaughtered

Coming back on you every woman you insult

That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters

I represent everything, you take for granted

Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade

And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone

Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name

Cameras are off

Sad, but it happens to all of them

I'm the hindsight to say, I told you so!

Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow

I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow

If you don't stop after they call you the

Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits

When it's time to walk away

I'm every guilt trip

The baggage you had

But as you gather up all your possessions

If there's anything you have left to say

Unless it makes an impact don't bother

So before you rest your case

Better make sure you're packing a wallop

So one last time, I'm back

Before it fades into black and it's all over

Behold the final chapter in the saga

Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle

Twice the magic that started it all

Tragic portrait of an artist tortured

Trapped in his own drawings

Tap into thoughts

Blacker and darker than anything imaginable

Here goes a wild stab in the dark

(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco

It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun

Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum

About to explode all over the canvas

Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm



(Your music usually has them)

(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't

Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)



A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining

But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and

Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting

(puke) Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk

Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog

Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on, (oh..)

Its on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small

(It says) Ever since I drove a 79 Lincoln with white walls

Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to DIE HARD

So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card

Hip hop ain't dying on my watch



But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams

Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, I don't care, don't have two shits to give

Let me take you by the hand, to promise land, and threaten everyone

Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

Nah, (Whats your name?) Marshall

(Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder

(Is he rich like me?) Haha

[Verse 2]

No, If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad

I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad

Uh, The epitome and the prime example of what happens

When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and

Makes you want to get up and start dancing

Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, To be rapping

Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank

Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, I'm in the style department

With a pile in my car, ripping the isle apart

With great power comes absolutely no responsiblity, for content

Completely, despondent, and conde-scen-ding

The king of nonsense and contro-versy in on, a

Beat killing spree, your honor, I must, plea

Guil-ty, cause I sparked a, Revolution

Rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap

To take it to the next level, boost it

But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it

(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?

Cuz I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns

That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?

But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper

Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch

Cause its the



[Hook]

It's the time of the season, when hate runs high

And this time, give it to you easy, when I take back what's mine

With pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan

My job here isn't done, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing



(What's your name?) Shady

(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder

(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha

(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)



[Verse 3]

So yeah dad let's walk

Let's have us a father and son talk

But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block

Without me knocking your block off

This is all your fault

Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas

I appeal to all those walks of like

Whoever had strife

Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like

Cause I related to the struggles of [young] America

When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles

Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again

It's a stare ruckle, I chuckle

Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles

Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckleheads

The sound of my hustle says don't knock

The doors broken, it won't lock

It might just fly open, get cold cocked

You critics come pay me a visit

Misery loves company, please stay a minute

Kryptonite to a hypocrite

Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it

Too busy getting stoned in your glass house

To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out

Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers

So spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out

A completely brain dead Rainman

Doing a bankhead in a restraint chair

So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare

Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than

All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef

Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah

Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look

For a fucking reason for it that ain't there

But I still am a CRIMINAL

Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals

The last Mathers LP that went diamond

This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald

When will the madness end, how can it when

There's no method the pad and pen

The only message that I have to sing is:

Dad, I'm back at it again

You try to flip this on me?

If I spent more time with you, you say

Ok yeeah, I'm coo-coo, hey? Well, screw you

And I'd be the third person who screwed you today

Oh, four? Dre, Drake, Lupe? Oh touche

You were too two-faced for me

Thought you was my number one

True BlueAce but you ain't

And I can see you and you make

That little boo-boo face

Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo

You make my fucking Blutooth ache

You feeling blue too late

Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurfin' puke blue Kool Aid

Here's what you say to someone you hate



[Hook]

My life will be so much better if you dropped dead (dead)

I was laying in bed last night thinking

And this thought just popped in my head and I thought

Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)

I would feel so (so) much (much) better x3



[Verse 2]

Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink

Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think

Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go

Cause I told em I'm only driving drunk cause that bitch drove me to drink

I'm back on my fuck ho's

But a whole new hatred for blondes, but bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby come on

Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement

And I am channeling my anger through every single station it's on

Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say he-art cause you ripped it in two pa-arts

And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you are?

Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off

And pick myself up off the carpet

But I'll never say the L-word again

I la-la-la-la lesbian *shout*

I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest

My life would be so much better if you just

And this thought just popped in my head and I thought

Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)

[Bridge]

Cuz you told me, you love me, forever

Bitch, that was a lie

Now I never, wanted someone, to die

So bad in my fucking life but fuck it there's other fish in the sea



And I'mma have a whale of a time

Being a single sailor for the night

Bitch on a scale of 1 to 10, shit

I must be the holy grailer

Catch this ho I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name (great)

I might hit the club on a chica's tail, uh

Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back and hammer the nailer

These bitches tryna get atached with the failer

And latch him to the tail of my bumper to scratch them with the back of my trailer

Like I'm itchin' to get hitched

Yeah I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit

I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch

Bitch you complain when you listen to this

But you still throw yourself at me

That's what I call pitchin' a bitch

That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight

Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul

But my dick's on strike so all that love shit is null and void

Bitch I'm a droid, I void cupid stupid wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed

Oi oi oi man oh man you boy boy boys

Getting sick at these girls girls girls

Oink oink oink you fucking pigs

All you good boys doink doink doink

I got 99 problems and the bitch ain't one

She's all 99 of them I need a machine gun

I take em all out I hope you hear this song

And grow into a cardiac arrest have a heart attack

And just drop dead and I'mma throw a fucking party after this cause

My life will be so much better if you dropped dead (dead)

And this thought just popped in my head and I thought

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

[Verse 1]

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared

I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there

From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends

It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, f*ck an acronym

Cut the f*cking act like you're happy, I'm f*cking back again

With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?

It ain't over 'til I say it's over  enough when I say enough

Throw me to the wolves and close the gate up

I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves

When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it

Weight is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie

Hold them b*tches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff

Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos

I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt



[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]

This is survival of the fittest

This is do or die

This is the winner takes it all

So take it all



[Verse 2]

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish

I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post

And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough

To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?

They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath

I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust

Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust

So floor's open if you'd like to discuss

Top 5 in this mothaf*cka and if I don't make the cut

What, like I give a f*ck, I'ma light this b*tch up like I'm driving a truck

To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it

Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up

And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut

And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook

Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself

With a f*cking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!

Cause I just sh*tted on the mic, and I like getting cut

I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut

Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win

Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait

Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting

Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut

It's survival of what?



[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]

This is survival of the fittest

This is do or die

This is the winner takes it all

So take it all



[Verse 3]

So get your ideas, stack your ammo

But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle

This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and sh*t

Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this

Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick

I don't do this music sh*t, I lose my sh*t

Ain't got sh*t to lose, it's the moment of truth

It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit

But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do

Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!

So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades

So you'd better trade your f*cking mics in for some tool-box-es

Cause you'll never take my pride from me

It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drivers

But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve

Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed

And if you don't like me then f*ck you!

Self es-teem must be f*cking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me

My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me

I can see why the f*ck I disgust you

I must be a-llergic to failure cause every time I come close to it

I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling

Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?

What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in

Cause I don't belong in this world

That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often

Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad

So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward

And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist

Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems

Thinking he can try and solve 'em, I'm outside chalking up

Drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive talking to myself

Either that or inside hiding off in

The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed

I'm crying and sobbing, I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking

Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker 'cause he said I eyeballed him



[Bridge]

And if you fall, ill get you there, I'll be your savior from all the wars

That are fought inside your world, please have faith in my words cause

[Verse 2: Eminem]

I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling

Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?

Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling

Cause I obsess on everything and my mind it's small shit

Bothers me but now my father, he said Sayonara,then split

But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as

There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me

Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking

I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment

Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I

Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it

Headphones on straight ahead and kids try to start shit,

But if this all there is for me Life offers

Why bother even try and put up a fight It's nonsense

But I think a lightbulb just lit up in my conscience

What about those rhymes I've been jottin'

They are kinda giving me confidence

Instead of tryina escape through my comics,

Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx

To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that

Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him

Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch

Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on

I could be iconic, and my conquest is

Word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest

[Verse 3: Eminem]

I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is falling

Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome

Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work

Words like this and connect lines like crosswords

And use my enemy's words as strength

To try and draw from, and get inspired off em

Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit

By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit

Now you shut up bitch I am talking

Thought I was full of horseshit and now

You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking

Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins

Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense

So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins

It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins

Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of brian baldingers

You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical

With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus

You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can

Suck a dick The day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass

And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage

The most high exalting and I ain't halting

Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes

The best part about me is I am not you

I am me I'm a fire marshall and this is my

Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeed in fulfilling
Don't think I ever stopped to think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast, it was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember

Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling

Like I am always under attack man

I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling

Women dish him but really thinking

If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him

Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite

When I'm ripping shit, but since when did this many

People ever give a shit what I had to say

It's just my opinion

If it contradicts how I'm living

Put a dick in your rear end, your rear end that's why

Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it

For drawing more attention toward it

Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude

Thought I was that important

But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect

And battle for it, mad awards, (?) annoyed

Attaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out

Good luck trying to convince a blonde

That's like telling Gwen Stefan' that she sold out

Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt

In anyone's mind one day I'd (?) go down

In history think they know now (?)

Because everybody knows



[Chorus - Skylar Grey]

Everybody knows that're just an asshole

Everywhere that you go

People wanna go home

Everyone knows

Everybody knows

So don't pretend to be nice

There's no place you can hide

You are just an asshole

Everyone knows

Everyone knows



[Verse 2]

Thanks for the support, asshole *scratch* thanks for the support, asshole

Quit acting salty

I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth

When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out

Thought I was history

But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey

Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth

Lay'em off it

But what the fuck is all this thrash talking about

The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me

You knock me down, I went down from the counter

I fell but the fans caught me, and now

You're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me

To take my belt, word to Pacquiao

Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about

Gotta go in that ring and knock them out

Or you better not come out

It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare

So what if the insults are revolting

Even Helen Keller knows life stinks

You think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled

But you should give little shit what I think

This whole world is a mess

Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock

Just to go out watch Batman

Who needs to test(?) the testicles, not that man

Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage

Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model

Before they put bathsalts and all those water bottles in Colorado

So get lost, Waldo

My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping

A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole

With a pack torn of paper

But I'm not taking no crap, ho

Here I go down the back pole

And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go

Trying to dip through the back door retreating cause everybody knows



[Chorus - Skylar Grey]

Everybody knows that're just an asshole

Everywhere that you go

People wanna go home

Everyone knows

Everybody knows

So don't pretend to be nice

There's no place you can hide

You are just an asshole

Everyone knows

Everyone knows



[Verse 3]

Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth

I smack the girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull

Thinkin we have some magnetic pull

Screamin ICP in this bitch, how do fucking magnets work?

Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable

Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical

I'm making up words you can understandable, It's tragical

Thinkin some magical shit's gonna happen? That ain't practical

You crackin a joke, it's laughable, cause me and love's like a bad combination

I keep them feelings locked in a vault

So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable

My heart is truly guarded, full body armor

Bitch you just need a helmet because if you think you're special, you're retarded. Thinkin you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina, you're a train wreck, I got a one track mind

Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er

Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor

Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog, cause you're on my ass

But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent

With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin

Only women that I love are my daughters

And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther

So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line

It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up

So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time

It ain't never gonna stop. A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime, so even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive

Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, so now my cup is runneth over

And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster

I'm goin back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can't not been? rude off? so fear not my dear, and dry up your teardrops I'm here

White America's mirror, so I feel awkward and weird, you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too. You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows."""

But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it



So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment

'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick

And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch

Been public enemy

So I guess it ain't

So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang

cough syrup and Styrofoam

With the ugly Kardashian

Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past

But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow

And girl I ain't got no money to borrow

But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!

Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know

Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur's Cargo's

You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman

Unless you're a swallow

Something's wrong, I can feel it
Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what

If that means what I think it means

We're in trouble, big trouble

And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances

You are just what the doc ordered



I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes

I got a laptop in my back pocket

My pen'll go off when I half-cock it

Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a livin' and a killin' off it

Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office

With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his, nutsack

I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and as indecent as all hell

Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop

You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap

Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'

Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack

And at the exact same time

I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that

I'll still be able to break a mothafuckin' table

Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic

I was signed to Aftermath after the fact

How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs

Feel my wrath of attack

Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad

It's actually disastrously bad for the wack

While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece



Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret

To rap immortality like I have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's

Simply rage and youthful exuberance

Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

Hit the Earth like an asteroid

Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew)

MC's get taken to school with this music

Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""

Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up

Blow up and be in a position

To meet RunD.M.C., and induct them

Into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames

Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

On the wall of (shame)

You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames

Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy

You're witnessing a massacre, like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy

""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"", that's all they say, looking boy

You get a thumbs up, pat on the back

And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, looking boy

Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy?

I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, looking boy

I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit

Get outta my face, looking boy!

Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable

Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy

The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR

Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God

Kneel before General Zod

This planet's Krypton; no, Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent

Let off then I'm reloadin'

Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'

And I should not be woken; I'm the walking dead

But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin'

But I got your mom deep throatin'

I'm out my Ramen Noodle

We have nothing in common, poodle

I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm

And pay homage, pupil

It's me, my honesty's brutal

But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while

So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes

To maybe try to help get some people through tough times

But I gotta keep a few punchlines

Just in case, cause even you unsigned

Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime

I know there was a time where once I

Was king of the underground

But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

Appeal with the skin color of mine

You get too big and here they come tryin' to

Censor you, like that one line

I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Mathers LP 1 when I tried to say

""I'll take seven kids from Columbine

Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9""

See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal, coming through the portal

You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though

And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for

You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking Cornrows

You write normal? Fuck being normal

And I just bought a new raygun from the future

Just to come and shoot ya

Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad

Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad

Singing to a man while they played piano

Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel

So Ray J went straight to the radio station

The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""

Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)

Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma

You assuming I'm a human

What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman

Innovative and I'm made of rubber

So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me

And it'll glue to you and

I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating

Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting

For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating

Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated

I make elevating music, you make elevator music

""Oh, he's too mainstream""

Well, that's what they do when they get jealous

They confuse it; ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop""

Cause I found a hella way to fuse it

With rock, shock rap with Doc

Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it

""I don't know how to make songs like that

I don't know what words to use""

Let me know when it occurs to you

While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you

It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you

How many verses I gotta murder to

Prove that if you were half as nice

Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?

Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie

But look at the accolades these skills brung me

Full of myself, but still hungry

I bully myself, cause I make me do what I put my mind to

And I'm a million leagues above you

Ill when I speak in tongues

But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!

I'm drunk, so Satan, take the fucking wheel!

I'm asleep in the front seat

Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""

But in my head there's something

I can feel tugging and struggling

Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate

But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have

Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic

To the situation and understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons

Make lemonade then!

But if I can't batter the women

How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?

Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake

If you think I need to be overseas

And take a vacation to trip a broad

And make her fall on her face and

Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not

Why be a king when you can be a God?"

Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer

If science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use

Society will reap a great benefit



[Verse 1]

I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets

Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of tourettes

Fuck, fuck, fuck! Can't take the stress

I make a mess as the day progresses

Angry and take it out on the neighbours hedges

Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches

With these hedge trimming scisors with razor edges

Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this

Mess and make the best of this situation, I guess

Cuz I feel like a little bitch's, predicaments, despicable

I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous

I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy

This kid just took my stick of liquorice

And threw my sticker books in a picker bush

I wanna kick his toosh, but I was six and shook

This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook

He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book, now there's using your head



[Hook]

Mama always said 'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)

Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous

And I'mma be a pain in the anus

(Mama could be wrong)

I'mma use my head as a weapon

Find a way to escape this insaneness

Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

Guess it pays to be brainless



[Verse 2]

Fast forward some years later

A teenager, this is a fun, sweet

I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete

It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished

They've stomped me into the mud [gee] for what reason, you stomped me

But how do you get the shit beat out of you, be down and be upbeat

When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life

Chance To make it or succeed

Cuz you're doomed from the start

It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street

But if I had just kept my head up my ass

I could accomplish any task

Practicing trash talking in a trance

Locked in my room yeah But I got some plans mama

These damn rhymes are falling

Out of my pants pocket I can't stop it

And I'm starting to blend in more, school this shit helps for sure

I'm getting more self assured than I've ever been before

Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that

Threw my first punch, end of story

Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void

Been using it more as a bin for storage

Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword

Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore

Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain

Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head

Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't

Cause I'd probably be dahmer cause mama always said



[Hook]

Mama always said 'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)

Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous

And I'mma be a pain in the anus

(Mama could be wrong)

I'mma use my head as a weapon

Find a way to escape this insaneness

Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

Guess it pays to be brainless



[Bridge]

Now my mum goes womp womp womp

Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb

I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped

But somehow, I came out on top



[Verse 3]

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo

I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold

Now everywhere I go, they scream out 'Go'

I'm bout to clean house, yo

I'm Lysol, now I'm just household

Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out

Middle America, hear them yell out

[until] they were so scared, and those kids

Just about, belted out

Whatever spout that it fell out

Of my smart alleck mouth, it was so weird

Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it

Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as

Motherfuckin' difficult, ch'yea, til then

Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards

It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers

Til emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius

Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah

You motherfuckin' Insert insult here

Who the fuck would've thunk that one little lone MC would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it

And boy they did flock

Can't believe this little hick locked

This hip hop shit in his pocket and still the shit got

That white trash traffic and gridlock

Shit happened like a six blocks from a Kid Rock

Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-tober

And got forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog

Cause I turn into the unabomber mama always said



[Hook]

Mama always said 'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)

Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous

And I'mma be a pain in the anus

(Mama could be wrong)

I'mma use my head as a weapon

You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
And I believe I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave

Snatch the keys from your hand

I would squeeze and you'd laugh

And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me

And you must hate me

Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?

And you've had enough of me

I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge



[Hook]

But you won't break me

You'll just make me stronger than I was

Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you

And if I stumble, I won't crumble

I'll get back up and uhhh

And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you

Cause I'm stronger than I was



[Verse 2]

A beautiful face is all that you had

Cause on the inside you're ugly, man

But you're all that I love

Aggressed, you can't leave

Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please

And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees

And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave

Cause you left and you took everything I had left

And left nothing, nothing for me

So please don't wake me from this dream, baby

We're still together in my head

And you're still in love with me

Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

But you won't break me

You'll just make me stronger than I was

Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you

And if I stumble, I won't crumble

I'll get back up and uhhh

And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you

Cause I'm stronger than I was



[Verse 3]

You walked out, I almost died

It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized

Felt like I was in for a long bus ride

I'd rather die than you not be by my side

Can't count how many times I vomited, cried

Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh

We were Bonnie and Clyde

No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I

Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie

It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?

Cause if you could've took my life you would've

It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the

Other side of my pack and stuck a spike, too, should've

Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time

No one could hurt me like you could've

Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?

Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer

Cause this morning I finally stood up

Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the

First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams

And a life we could've had and we could've been

But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in

Pulling myself out of the dumps once again

I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit

I'mma be late for the pity party

But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again

Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends

I'm done being your punching bag

It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary

Two years, but you left on the first of May

I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say

But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay

And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was

But I hate you cause you drained me

I gave you all, you gave me none

But if you blame me, you're crazy

And after all that's said and done

I'm still angry, yeah, I maybe

I may never trust someone



[Hook]

But you won't break me

You'll just make me stronger than I was

Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you

And if I stumble, I won't crumble

I'll get back up and uhhh

That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)





I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek

Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey

Wanted to receive attention for my music

Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me

Been wanting my cake, And eat it too

And wanting it both ways

Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated

When I blew seep and it was confusing

Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam

Hit the lottery (oh wee)

With what I gave up to get was bittersweet

It was like winning a huge meet

Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink

I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep

Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith

But I'm actually weirder than you think

Cause I'm...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh

Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh





Now I ain't much of a poet

But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment

And don't squander it

Cause you never know when it could all be over

Tomorrow so I keep conjuring

Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from

(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way you're wandering?)

I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster

And save me from myself and all this conflict

Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it

My OCD is conking me in the head

Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking

I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying

Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...





I'm friends with the monster

That's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me

Stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy

Yeah, you think I'm crazy



Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh

Well, that's nothing

oh oh oh oh





Call me crazy, but I had this vision

One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian

But, until then,

drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at

Emcees, blood get spilled and I

Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track

Give every kid who got played at

Pumped the feeling

and shit to say back

To the kids who played 'em

I ain't here to save the fucking children

But if one kid out of a hundred million

Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great

It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back

In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that

Straw in the gold chump I will spend

Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack

Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts

I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that

It's nothing, I'm still friends with the...





I'm friends with the monster

I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr.Brightside, glass is half full
But my tank is half empty, gasket just blew

[Verse 1]

This always happens, 30 minutes from home

Gotta lay a log cabin and only option I have is McDonald's bathroom

In a public stall dropping a football

So every time someone walks in the john I get Madden

''Shady, what up?''- What? Come on, man, I'm crapping

And you're asking me for my got damn autograph on a napkin?

Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue

Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then

''Thanks, dawg, name's Todd, a big fan''

I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and

Told him ''Todd, you're the shit'' when does all of this crap end?

Can't park my ass without causing an accident

Puff my gas, cut my grass, can't take out the fucking trash

Without someone passing through my sub harassing

I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math

I'd rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash

But the antacid is my stomach gas

I mix my corn with my fucking mash

Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass

Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upperclass

Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper

Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass

Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?

B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass

Maybe that's why I feel so strange

Got it all, but I still won't change

Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit

It's the motivation that keeps me going

This is the inspiration I need

I can never turn my back on a city that made me

[Verse 2]

They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that

Don't know what the fuck I would doing if it weren't rap

Probably be a giant turd-sack

But I blew, never turned back

Turned 40 and still sag

Teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack

Fuck you gonna say to me?

I leave on my own terms, asshole, I'm going berzerk

My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has

I get to meet famous people, look at her, dag

Her nylons ran, her skirt snag

And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag

Fucking my Hanes shirt tag

You're Danica Patrick (yeah) work, skag

We'd be the perfect match

Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag

My apologies, no disrespect to technology

But what the heck is all of these buttons?

You expect me to sit here and learn that?

Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?

Be an expert at computers?

I'd rather be an encyclopedia Britannica, hell with a Playstation

I'm still on my first manual from Zelda

Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the

Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread

Make a sandwich with welch's and belch

They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but

I think there's more white trash from the trailer

Jed Clampett, Redd Sanford welfare mentality helps to

Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I

Managed to dwell within these parameters

Still cramming the shelves full of hamburger helper

I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt to

Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter

With all these pet peeves

God dammit to hell, I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones

I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I can yell, the

Other day someone got little elaborate and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox

Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings

I think my karma is catching up with me

Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good

So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque

I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked

I'm trying to be lowkey, hopefully nobody notices me

In produce hunched over, giant nosebleed

Over stop as I mosey over to the frozen aisle

By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me

Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova

Show's over, I'm hiding in Kroeger buying groceries

He just had front row seats, told me to sign this poster

Then insults me ""wow, up close didn't know you had crow's feet""

I'm at a crossroad lost till shopping at Costco

Sloppy Joe's, buck waffles

Got caught picking my nose, ah

Look over see these two hot hoes

Finger still up in one of my nostrils

Right next to 'em stuck at the light

This fucking shit is taking forever to change

I'm stuck, these bitches are loving it rubbing it in

Chuckling, couldn't do nothing, play it off

''What you bumping? Trunk Muzik? Yelawolf's better'', fucking bitch

They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it

The pressure, they want me to follow up with another one after Recovery

Was so highly coveted, but what good is a fucking recovery if I fumble it?

Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip

Hopping on shrubbery on you sons of bitches

Wrong subdivison to fuck with, bitch

Quit snapping fucking pictures of my kids

I love my titty, but you push me to my limit, what a pity

The shit I complain about

It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out

Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'd never get it out

Bitch, I got an elevator in my house

Ants and a mouse, I'm living the dream

Somethin's burnin', I can't figure out what
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded, must just be the powder from the power of love
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone

Is that my soon to be spouse's moan

And the further I walked allowed her

I paused for a minute to make something, that's what I heard

Cuz after all this is her place

So I gave her the benefit of the doubt

Think I might be about Busta Busta

The thought's so scary, yo that it hurts, brace

Hope it ain't, there we go, yo

Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario, though, in the first place

But you confirmed my low end theory, though

Should've known when I made it all the way to third base

And that was only the first date, coulda made it to home plate

But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first

No, you don't, under, stand, I, don't, do this for

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more

She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more

I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door

She screamed she loves me like she never did before

[And I told her go where you want

And go do what you want to do. I don't care]x2



[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]

I told that bitch

I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick

Suckin' dick in your momma's tub 'til your granny walked in

Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned

Like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter

You beat the case and I called you

""Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone

And Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those

Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period

Now have a blessed day""

Bitch you serious? I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious

Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me up, a Caesarean

You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious

I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman

After the dillinger hit'em diligently and killin' him

His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem

That's analogy and metaphor for yah

I should win a medal for all the ways I adore yah

This is me talkin' poetry, yeah I got some home trainin'

That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was famous

As Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool

Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle, singin'

I hope she's good enough, meanwhile you're chasin' her

So needless to say I'm feeling betrayed

Snatched my housekey off my keychain

She jumped off, Wee-Bey from The Wire, escape

Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater

Here goes that broken record, cliche, it's all my fault anyway

She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break

Treats my face like seratos, she cuts and scratches like a DJ

Each day is an instant replay

They sayin' we display cinethematic abatic behavior

Back together but forgot today was her b-day, cut me off on the freeway

Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes

Then I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait

Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline, stepped on them fuckers 8 times

Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up

But them other F-U-C-K's all would of hit the off ramp

So I coast into a gosh damned aww hit a fuckin' tree

Now here she comes at full speed, she's racin' at me

Okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?

Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she screamin'

I body slam her onto the cement, until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole

Bury this stink ho in it, then payed to have the street re-paved

Fuck, woke up in a dream state in a cold sweat

Like I got hit with a freeze ray durin' a heat wave

Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin' next to me in bed

Directly aimin' a gat at my head

Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab

I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy

Every girl I've ever had either says I got to much baggage

Or I'm just too dramatic

Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic

I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!

Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex

I actually set off a chain reaction, a tragic event

I said ""hit the road"" and after she left

I sent that bitch a text

I said ""be careful driving, don't read this and have a accident""

She glanced to look at it and write, too bad

Thought we had a connect

No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case

Than a model covered in L'Oreal and mace, who fell from grace

Eleven stories for story telling but the whore was yelling ""rape""

So the vocal cords were swelling

And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spelling's face

Still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes

To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace

Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date, don't be late

Well the sentiments great, but wait then there's been a mistake

You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate

I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of

Wait dinner at eight

I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of



Love, love, love, love

And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far



I went in headfirst

Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse

My mom probably got it the worst

The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are

Did I take it too far?

Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs

But regardless I don't hate you cause ma!

You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom

Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam

Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb

Equivalent to Chemical warfare

And forever we can drag this on and on

But, agree to disagree

That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me

You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve

(little prick just leave) ma, let me grab my fucking coat

Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats?

Especially when dad, he fucked us both

We're in the same fucking boat

You'd think that it'd make us close (nope)

Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine

A car full of belongings

Still got a ways to go, back

To grandma's

House it's straight up the road

And I was the man of the house, the oldest

So my shoulders carried the weight

Of the load

Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and

That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable

And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far



Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though

Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth

But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry

Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause

Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes

That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio

And I think of Nathan being placed in a home

And all the medicine you fed us

And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but

Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow

And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though

But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo

All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both

Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours

But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause

One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was

Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address

But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus

Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas

Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's

If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them

And although one has met their grandma

Once you pulled up in our drive one nights

As we were leaving to get some hamburgers

Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you

And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me

As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and

I saw your headlights as I looked back

And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad

So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet

I guess I had to get this off my chest

I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead

The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing

So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message

That I'll always love you from afar, cause you're my mama...



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far



I want a new life, one without a cause

So I'm coming home tonight, well, no matter what the cost

And if the plane goes down, and if the crew can't wake me up

Just know that I was alright, and I was not afraid to die

Even if there's songs to sing, my children will carry me

Just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die

Because I put my faith in my new girl, so I never say goodbye cruel world

Just know that I'm alright, I am not afraid to die 



I guess we are who we are

Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life"

Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think.. I think the lines are starting to get blurry
[Verse 1]
I'm in a strange place

I feel like Mase when he gave up the game for his faith

I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints

Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space

Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face

I need a change of pace cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous

There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst

I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em

Cause that's where most of my anger is based

Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints

I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks

Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's

I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack

I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack

I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is

I'm strapped for battles, suck a duck, crawl out the back, bar fight

Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air

And bottles breaking, mirrors also

And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full

You done called every woman a slut, but you forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin!)

Oh my bad, slut

And next time I show up in court I'll be naked and square a lawsuit

Judge be like ""that's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?

Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you

And jmp your bones, you sexy motherfucker

You so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you au jus

Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo

Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you''

I believe people can change, but only for the worse

I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse

So satanic K-Mart chains panic

Cause they can't even spin back the curse words

Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker

(I fuck em - rape your mother)

And these kids are like parrots

They run around the house just like terrorists

Screaming ""fuck, shit, fuck""

Adult with a childish like arrogance

Wild ever since the day I came out I was like ""merits, fuck that""

I'd rather be loud and I like swearing

From the first album even the gals were like ""tight lyrics, dreamy eyes""

But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish

And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this

And the opposition felt the opposite

Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums

Often as I can and skim through all them bitches

To make sure I keep up with my competition

Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes

Borderline genius who's bored of his lines

And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now

Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies



[Hook]

This darkness comes in me

(Evil twin)

And comes again

That ain't me

He's just a friend who pops up now and again

So don't blame me, blame him

I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin



[Interlude]

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend

You have slept for quite some time



[Verse 2]

So who's left? Lady Gaga? Messed with the Bieber

Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither

Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever

Get the cloriseptic Excedrin aleve or extra strength Tylenol 3's

Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'

Bed ridden and destined to never leave the

Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger

My suicide notes, barely legible read the

Bottom, it's signed by The Joker

Lorena said I never can leave her

She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her

Fuck that shit, bitch

Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers

I'ever left it at beaver

Get them titties cut off trying to mess with the cleaver

Golly-wally, I bet he registered Jesus

Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definite lean

My destiny went on the steps, I met Deshaun at Osborn

I'd never make it to sophomore

I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors

Flip burgers and wash dishes, but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em

Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em

They was sleeping, I made them stop snorin'

Made them break out the popcorn

Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form

Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn

Screaming ''fuck the police'' like cop porn

Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn

Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4

ANd that includes Biggie and Pac, whore

And I got an evil twin, so who do you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?

And as crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him

And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?

But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)

Please come in, what was your name again?

Hi, faggot

Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there

Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair

And you're all aware I ain't got it all upstairs

Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there

Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me

That I should call the looney police to come get me

Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish somebody finally admit me

Into a mental hospital with Britney

Oh, LMFAO, no way, ho

Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no

Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony

Hey ho, hey ho

I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to hip hop hooray

No I'm hollering you got bottom-end like an 808

And a [bass] whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so

Let the low end raise, yo

Tango, what you think, ho?

Slow dancing or bowling

You trying to hold hands with your homie?

What? You think I'm looking for romance cause I'm lonely?

Change that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me

Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner

Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt

Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work

So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work

But all bullshit aside I hit a stride

Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed

As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side

And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize

Cause we are the same, bitch"

One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one ""ouch""
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger

In a dumb gown, black hood

With a scythe

Shit I laughed in his face spit

Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this

Now get your ass back in that game

Bitch don't take shit for granted

And don't take shit, give it!

Only bull you should take is by the horns

A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor

I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword

Finish writing then record

Replenish keep writing more

Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for

So you fight, scratch, you claw

Backs to wall

No one was there to catch you fall

You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off

You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and

Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it

Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'

Nobodies gonna back you in the corner

Throw a hornet

No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming

Like there's nothing that's more important

MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it

Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?

And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face

I ain't finished bitch

I meant in half, oil the blades

Nobody wants to play

They say I'm a spoiled little baby

But



[Hook]

Nobody put's baby in the corner

I'm only trying to warn ya

Cus that baby get's mad

And get's to throwing a tantrum

He'll fucking flip on ya



Cus' nobody put's baby in the corner

I'm only trying to warn ya

Cus that baby get's mad

And get's to throwing a tantrum

He'll fucking flip on ya



[Verse 2]

What goes through an addict's brain?

Besides static pain and big daddy kane

Break, beats and words

An erratic train of thought

Like splatter paint

Scatter brain

Yeah maybe why that explains

Why you're back but you don't rap the same

And you're looking way thinner

Because your hunger got you looking like

They took away dinner

Sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though

Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat

When you say you're a chooka what chooka what

Now fling that bitch from your fingertips

I hope it lands on another rap singers lips

Who can't think of shit

Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit

Whose king of this fucking English Lit?

Let your middle fingers flip

On each hand, whilst extending this shit

How low can you go?

Lower then Chuck D ho

Hear the bass of this in my voice

Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?

Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius

I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap

Not a man, I'm a weapon

Who just happened to be a rapper

Who just happen to be on the crapper

When it happened I had an epiphany

In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after

Now I'm back with an apper-tite

For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster

So let's eat cos' I'm famished

Every deed is a dastardly one

Evil its past it

Even you asking for me to be pulled

Like to people

Is like me having my teeth pulled



[Hook]



[Verse 3]

So step inside of dimension

The demented side of a mind

That's like the inside of an engine

While I multiply your undivided attention

But be reminded that if I didn't mention

I lose my mind and my temper

You'll be the first one

Who finds him offensive

Got him climbing the fences

Lost some time to addiction

But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary

I'm in the picture

Eminem is the synonym for it

I'm an enigma

Fuck it let's get to the meat, balls

I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes

Edgamacater, they are

Shit legends are madea

Spit treachreous data

Shit that you would say to your worst enemy

This wretchedness is

What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada

And combine em' with Method Man and Redman

Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand

And in his right there's a sledge-hammer

And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam

Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam

Maybe I need my head examined

Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb

Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan

I need meds!

Swear to god cus' If I go off the edge

T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man

Heart throb at a fart, ah nah

More like a smart slob, part blob

That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject

To the heart and leave claw marks

All over the Wal-Mart walls

Little baby with large balls

Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging

There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being

King of the playground

I hate the swings but I love being the underdog

Cos when I'm pushed

I end up swinging up"

Girl you gimme writers block
I'm at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?

That's what I call a Roethlisberger

You drive me bonkers I'm about to get my swerve on for sure

Thought I was pimpin until I felt like Nas, the first date

Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers

And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops or ???

Probably should of never let me call that job of yours

To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work

Should of been one of the first signs to cause to learn

Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I can't be apart from her

Cause nobodies body's awesomer - I lust it, and she loves me cause I'm popular, but...



[Hook: Jamie N Commons]

You know this ain't love

Oh, no, you know this ain't love

You know this ain't love

No, this ain't love

(What is it then?) It's desperation



She's lookin for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her

(It's desperation)

I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her



[Verse 2: Eminem]

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you til I went to the lengths I did to meet you

Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning

Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery

Cause now you see nothin but me, and I don't see nothin but you

And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in

We stuck to each others hips and we can't do anything individually

Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can't, specifically to describe it I just can't seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you

Talkin bout ""I live and breathe you""

And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me

As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer

Don't wanna be without you, don't wanna be with you neither, bitch

Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek, cause this ain't...



[Hook]



...and here I go again



[verse 3: Eminem]

Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else

What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick

I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz

I mean it's time that we just split and leave the games behind

Your frame of mind ain't the same as mine, I think

You need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?

That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up

To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's

You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? (what) ???

I'm just mad it took the time it took me to discover

You been using me for loot like I used you for looks

Thought you was too good for me, huh? ??? used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack, but I can't stomach this

I'm leavin you, not comin back. She said ""The fuck with that

Where's my Louisville Slugger at?""

She grabbed that fuckin bat and swung it at my head

I barely ducked and that's right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice

Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100 yard field goal, through the uprights

What is a nightmare? The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare
[Verse 1]
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop

And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons

Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching

Missouri from Michigan didn't work

So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan

Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again

Mom please stick to a decision

Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen she's like

Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are kryptonite

To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches

But I run into them, running through the kitchen

Pretending to be blind, Superman

Cos I had no supervision

But I did have a super power though

I could turn into invisible kid

Disappear out of sight, like a true magician

And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different

Music into the picture and it become my new religion

""I remember it clearly, even today""

Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned

Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping

Through the radio stations one day

And discovered this DJ who was mixing

I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the wizard

You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing

I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing

For shoes, fuck them stupid pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition

You get the new LL Cool J

Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and [?Hoover] and somehow I found my future is in this

That's how I know my mission

Little boom box boomin', spitting

Practicing numerous rhythms

When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'

I remember Proof would visit

Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go complete ballistic

Go through the roof for his shit

It's like we knew the instant

We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit

Never quit, too persistent



Started a group of misfits

Proof had a proposition

If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit

Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and

Be ready to come off the top as sharp position

If you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slippin'

They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you

And you forgot your written

Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again

It tried dong ditching shit

I fucking got that bitch in a headlock

Cut off his oxygen Slim

[??]

Now I got my pot to piss in



I'm in a league Muhammad's in

All these [?] bombing them

Probably end up on top of them

Stomping them like Ndamukong

I'm rushing at the

Flow vomits in your face

Competitors fall at my waist

You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face

So name the time, place to battle

Bitch I'm still in that mind state

Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes

Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose

But you turds better be careful how you choose yours

Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse

And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers

Ooh, no more trippin in bird shit, this songs a self empowerment surgeon

Words of encouragement but this [?]

The rap games God, but the name's not James Todd?, I'm just a wordsmith

So let these words lift

Cos all I got is bars for you dumbbells and doors ain't working out

Each verse is more [?] than the first

And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast? to get served



They shall not escape my vengeance



And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone

Word to Uncle Ron

I'm turning into an unhumble Don

You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on

So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on

Better back away from the front row, get gone

Bigger then Dikembe Mutumbo

I'm the fucking jungle tron

I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts

I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yard

So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass

And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap

The GOAT just ate eight acres, and ate the vet

Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper

Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook

Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot



Like oak wood was burning

Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside

Lookin' out, cause...



I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light



Yesterday was the tornado warning

Today's like the morning after: your world is torn in half

You wake in its wake to start the mourning process

And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress

Today's a whole new chapter

It's like an enormous asthma

Thunderstorm has passed ya

You weathered it and poked its eye out

With the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses

Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is

Stuffed, so focused on the bright side

Then you floor the gas pedal

And hit the corner fast, the more asserted

Never looking back, may hit the curb

But every day is a new learning curve

As you steer through life

Sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to

To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage

Cause they hurt you so bad

It's like they murdered your ass

And threw dirt on your casket

But you've returned from the ashes

And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline

And while you're burning the past

Standing in the inferno and chant



I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light



You're so familiarized

With what having to swallow this pill is like

It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life

And it's as though you feel you've died

Cause you've been killed inside

But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive

Although today you may weep, cause you're weakened

And everything seems so bleak and

Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'

It begins to seep in; that's the only thing keepin'

You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end

And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling

And with a little time that should do the healing

And by tomorrow you may even feel so good

That you're willing to forgive 'em

Even after all the shit you been put through, this feeling

Of resilience is building, and the flames are burning

Quick as fire would through this building

You're sealed in, but you're fireproof

Flame retardant, you withstood it

And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'

You look down, cause you're so over 'em

You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling



As time passes, things change every day

But wounds, wounds heal

But scars still remain the same

But tomorrow, today's going down in flames

Throw the match, set the past ablaze



So feel the fire beneath your feet

As you barely even perspire from the heat

Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief

And as you say goodbye to the grief

It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell

But you've extinguished this livin' hell

Still a little piece of you dies as you scream



I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light



I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn

Rising, a phoenix from the flames

I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine

Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly



And I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames

It's a beautiful kind of pain

Settin' fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light"

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

[Verse 1]

Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder

Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition

It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an

80 degree day and theres no fricken air conditioning

And you can't see the big terrace risen

'Cus you got the windows up blaring the system in your chevrolet prism

The devil ain't on the level same as him

Just someone who rebels in straight masochism

And imagine him giving him an adjective an ass whooping so bad they should put his ass in prison

I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally

Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap

Caddilac from a K Car, My ass from a hole in a ground, still can't tell a [?]

Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud

To shop at k-mart and it became art

And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are

To this day I still get in fights with the same broad

At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart

In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a fuck I don't play!

You think you saw this basket first?

Yeah backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay

Illest shit you could think I would say

Mind's like a pile of clay

When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?

Put a gaping hole in it

[?]

Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State

Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state

And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates

So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray

But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face [?]

And this got nothing to do with a scalar

[?]

By the way thoughts are getting darker by the day

I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay

It's a fucking miracle to be this lyrical

Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face I'm insane

Every rhyme I say [?] like an ultra violet ray

I'm sellin hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat

$11.99 so come on and pile a plate

I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise

With the rhyme I'm spittin while I'm shittin' on the competition

In the meantime it's always mean time



[Hook 2x]



[Verse 2]

I've been a career asshole

I don't see why these people always got my back

I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake

But I was put here not by accident

I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish

Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit

And I'm coming to get that quarter back

[?] the drama can build

Your mama can ask me for my autograph

That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book

But I sure would fall for that

You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight

When I get on the mic I'm a snap

Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital when I overdosed would have caught a flat

If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it

Indigestion my suggestions [?]

If it feels like I'm running away with the game

Its 'cus I am don't speculate spectate

All I got is ?? days and insults for decades

But I get by my wicked ways lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches

Cry till you get puffed eyes red face

But I'm leaving on this jet plane

????

I'm sick of pounding a squarepagan around all ?? of the catchrays

But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace

Cuz you just ain't big enough to fit your damage ???

Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase

Cuz baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds I peed my bed

I'm going blind I don't see my legs I keep on falling down

No wonder you can't stand me I need my cane

Someone help me I think my face is melting

You ???my grains these maggot in my brain

This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head

If you read my mind you can see my pain

And you'd see why I'd be this way

Ever since I was ???playin' with ??

Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game"

Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Althought the whole world knows your name
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game

Ooooohhhhhhh

It shouldn't be difficult to explain

Just why you came back again, you hate the fame

Love the game, cold as ice you remain

Fuck em' all, tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again



So, god damn... is it that time again already

Haha, you don't look too happy to see me

Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once

All right, fuck ya'll then



(Verse 1)



You can get the dick, just call me the ballsac, I'm nuts

Michael Vick in this bitch, fall back you mutts

Fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy

Fuck it a sick duck, I'm on my duck sick mummy

And my nuts, lick, gobble 'em up trick, yummy

Bitch you don't fucking think that I know that you suck dick dummy?

You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey

Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny!

Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words

You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker

Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker

Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cock sucker

This shit is on, cause you wen't and pissed me off

Now I'm sitting and pissing on everbody

give a fuck if it's right or wrong

So buck the buddah, light a bong

But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon



(Chorus)



Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows

When it snows and it's twenty be-low

Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know

I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows

Oh oh oh oh oh



(Verse 2)



Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth

Ya'll are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing

I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out

Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker

I'll show you pussy footin, I'll kick a bitch in the cunt

Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion

Who the fuck is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy

Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom

Go ahead, fucking hater push me

I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me

Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy

Man the fuck up sissy, G's up

All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)

Man chill, nah I can't god damnit

Rappers are land fill, drop the anvil

These are shoes that you can't fill

Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning

And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still

During an earthquake, urine in your face

Cause you're fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!

Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening

Alright then I quit, god I give up

Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do

This is for your sins, I cleanse you

You can repent but I warn you, if you continue

To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said



Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows

When it snows and it's twenty be-low

Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know

I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows

Oh oh oh oh oh



(Verse 3)



How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day

til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say

So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs

Like i miss the pass when I went long

If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong

Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song

Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women

When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming

Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so

So don't compare me to them other bums over there

It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah

I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair

But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you

I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune

That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme

And say I was writing this and I thought of you so



Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows

When it snows and it's twenty be-low

Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know

I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows

Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I don't know, I don't know what caused, I don't know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way

I don't know, I don't know by I probably be this way til my dying day

Ayo, before i start this song man, I just wanna thank everyone for being so patient
And bearing with me over the past few years while I figure this shit out
(Hook)



Is anybody out there, It feels like I'm talking to myself

No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I come from

Can anybody hear me yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself

Feels like I'm going insane, am I the one who's crazy



So why in the world do I feel so alone

Nobody but me, I'm on my own

Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel

That there is and let me know so I know that I'm not the only one



(Verse 1)



I went away I guess that opened up some lanes

But there was no one who even knew I was going through growing pains

Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane

I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne

It's like I was jealous of him, cause of the attention he was getting

I felt horrible about myself, he was spitting and I wasn't

Anyone who was buzzing back then could of got it

Almost went at Kanye too, god it feels like I'm going psychotic

Thank god that I didn't do it

I'd of had my ass handed to me, and I knew it

But proof isn't here to see me through it

I'm in the booth popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it

Are you stupid? You gon' start dissing people for no reason

Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even

You're lying to yourself, you're slowing dying

You're denying, your health is declining with your self esteem

you're crying out for help



(Hook)



Is anybody out there, It feels like I'm talking to myself

No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I come from

Can anybody hear me yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself

Feels like I'm going insane, am I the one who's crazy



So why in the world do I feel so alone

Nobody but me, I'm on my own

Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel

That there is and let me know so I know that I'm not the only one



(Verse 2)



Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow

All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow

Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I hit my bottom tomorrow

My sorrow echos in this hall though

But I must be talking to the wall though, I don't see nobody else

(I guess I keep talking to myself)

But all these other rappers suck is all that I know

I've turned into a hater, I put up a false mavado

But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto

He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled

Inside him, one foot on the brake, one of the throttle

Falling asleep with writers block in the parking lot of Mcdonalds

But instead of feeling sorry for yourself, do something about it

Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded

You're powdered long enough, It isn't them, its you, you fucking baby

Quit worrying bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fucking going crazy



(Hook)



Is anybody out there, It feels like I'm talking to myself

No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I come from

Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel

That there is and let me know so I know that I'm not the only one



(Verse 3)



So I picked myself up off the ground, and fucking swam before I drowned

Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, advice this time around

It's different, them last 2 albums didn't count

Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out

I've come to make it up to you, now no more fucking around

I got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I let 'em down

So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal

I feel like me again, let me formally re-introduce myself

To you for those of you who don't know

The new me's back to the old me, and homie I don't show no

Signs of slowing or bowing, I'm blowing up all over

My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over homos

I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep your head up

T.I. keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up

Don't let up, just keep slaying em

Rest in peace to DJ AM, cause I know what this shit is like

I struggle with this shit every single day and I'm

So there it is, damn, feels like i just woke up or something

Guess I just forgot who the fuck I was man

Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at, It was never nothing personal

Just some shit that I was going through

And to the rest of you, I'm back!

Ah, yesterday my dog died, i hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow

You wanna criticize dog, try a little more

I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole

I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro

Better hold on a little tighter here i go

Flows tighter, as hot headed as Ghostrider

Cold hearted as Spiderman, throwin' a spider in the snow

So you better get to blowing in flow rider

Inside of a Lowrider with no tires in the hole

Why am I like this? why is winter cold?

Why is it when I talk, im so biased to the hoes

Listen dog christmas is off this is as soft as it gets

This isnt golf this is a blistering assault

Those are your wounds this is the salt, so get lost

Shit dissin' me is just like pissin off the Wizard of Oz

Wrap a lizard in gauze, beat you in the jaws with it

Grab the scissors and saws

And, cut out your livers gizzards and balls

Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws

So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw

Then discribe how it tasted like dessert to us all

Got the gall to make chris piss in his draws

Ticklin' him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You're on fire

Thats how ya know you're on a roll

I just put a bullshit hook in between two long ass verse

If you mistook the for a song, look

This aint a song, its a warnin to Brooke, Hogan and David Cook

That the crook just took over so book

Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it

I'm lightening in a skillet, you're a fuckin flash in the pan

I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan

Mr Mathers is the man

Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can

Come back and whip your ass with it again

Salivas like sulfuric acid in your hand

It'll eat through anything metal, the ass of iron man

Turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin chance is assanine

Yeah ask Denaun, man

Hit a blind man with a coloring book

And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon

Fuck it, I ain't playin

Pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin a sign sayin'

Vietnam Vet, im out my fuckin mind man

Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him 9 grand

So if I seem a little mean to you, this aint savage you ain't never seen the brew

You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route

You couldn't make a belemic puke on a piece of fuckin corn and peanut ??

Sayin' you sick, quit playin you prick dont nobody care

Then why the fuck am I yellin' at air?

I ain't even talkin to no one, cause ain't nobody there

Nobody will fuckin test me cause these hoes wont even dare

I'm wastin punchlines but I got so many to spare

I just thought of another one that might go here

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
[Eminem]
Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for __ like Philly,

I feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely,

I apologize if all that I sound like, is I'm complaining,

But life keeps on complicating, an' I'm debating,

On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,

Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it,

But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty,

When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help.

I can't do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs,

Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,

Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.

I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors,

I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?

I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,

I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,

Shit..



[Chorus]



[Eminem]

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon,

Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you.

Marshall what happened at you, you can't stop with these pills,

And you've fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin' at you.

It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up,

Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.

Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,

They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,

Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,

He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first,

But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse,

Now I'm poppin Vic's, perks and Methadone pills.

Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,

Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like ""yes man"",

And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it,

It's in their best interest to protect their investment.

And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then...



[Chorus]



Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...



My friends just can't understand this new me,

That's understandable man, but just think how bananas you'd be,

You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.

And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do,

I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is,

Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.

I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin' the same damn DVD,

Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.

And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright.

And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night,

I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right,

I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.

Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, don't look now,

Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.

Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice,

Yeah baby hold me down.



[Chorus]



[Eminem]

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I'm pullin' through.

Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof.

I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,

Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.

Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?

I think about the things I would never got to say to you,

I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do.

Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,

I still love your mother, that'll never change,

Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.

Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,

But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day.

There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,

Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain.

But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame,

I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint.

I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history,

But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,

I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way.

But I just had to get away, don't know why,

I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm..

I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyric off of this paper before I lay 'em

But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em

'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem

When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world

Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me

I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably

And all those who look down on me

I'm tearin' down your balcony

No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or ""how can he""

From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's

Still shittin', whether he's on salary, paid hourly

Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse

He's married to the game

Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas: his gift is a curse

Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt

And fuck the whole Universe



I'm not afraid to take a stand

Everybody, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road



Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap

I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm

For you to know it's a wrap

You said you was king, you lied through your teeth

For that, fuck your feelings

Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back

I promise to never go back on that promise

In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhhh

Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now

All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack BLAOW

Cause I ain't playin' around

There's a game called circle and I don't know how

I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out

Thought I had it mapped out

But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud

Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons

These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now



I'm not afraid to take a stand

Everybody, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road



And I just can't keep livin' this way

So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage

I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons

I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground

I've had enough, now I'm so fed up

Time to put my life back together right now



It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me

Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you

So I could come back a brand-new me

You helped see me through

And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I've been through the wringer

But they can do little to the middle finger

I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of

My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers

And drop dead: no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise

To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father

So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters

And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it

Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club

Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up

Cause I'm raisin' the bar

I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars

I feel amazin', and I'm



I'm not afraid to take a stand

Everybody, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

I dunno man, just feels like, well alot different
Kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now
Feels strange but um, I guess it's kinda like... it's kinda like

(Verse 1)



I feel like I'm morphin, into something so indcredible, that I'm dwarfin'

All competetors, better get your girlfriend in check

It's psychological warfare, endorphin side-effect

Your self esteem shatters his dialect

Comes blasting out your deck, she loves me

So much passion you'd expect this sort reaction from her yet

Your strong oh, you're fucking corny, you try to turn your charm on

Cause you just think you're Bishop the don one

But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one

I'm cockin' my head back like 'Ed Lover, come on son

She's on my johnson, she brings my name up constant

Your boys are like ""she's fucking with dude, she wants son""

Homeboy, you better get a clue

She's on my dick cause I spit better than you

What you expect her to do? How you expect her to act in the sack

When she's closing her eyes, fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track



(Hook)



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you



(Verse 2)



She's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar

She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you

Than to count the things that are

There's a seven disc, CD changer in her car

And I'm in every single slot, and you're not, awww

I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star

And I'm not about to sick back and just keep rhyming one syllable, nah

Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up, cause they're just not good enough

But I'm not giving up til I get my respect, and I won't stop til I get enough

Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations, aww

That hater alarm is sounding off, and Obama took the bomb from my name, aww

So quit crying that I took your dame, homie she's my dame, aww

You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game boy

And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came for it

You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy

But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?

It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man I can't call it



(Hook)



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you



(Verse 3)



It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear

You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker

Dear, while I freak this world premier

Seducing her, loosen up with a little freestyle

Wait, am I losing ya? Am I making you look bad?

Well I got news for ya homie, you're losing her

Oh wait she don't like when I spit it fast

Am I tryna show how, let me slow it down

It's still gonna be a blowout

You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album

Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something

To see if you can save any of it punk, but none of it's fucking with me

Prick you really feeling that bullshit?

You think you killing them syllables? quit playing

These beats ain't nothing to fool with

They call me fire Marshall, I shut the shit down

Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round

I am also the opposite of what you are like

You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic

I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck

She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck

From sucking my dick, aww fuck



(Hook)



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""fuck the world"", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers

I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour

Married to the game but she broke her vows

That's why my bars are full of broken bottles

And my night stands are full of open Bibles

I think about more than I forget

But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat

And these niggas know I lay them down, make their bed

Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg

Money outweighing problems on the triple beam

I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes

Be good or be good at it

Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic

Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's ""fuck what they say""

I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away

Man, I come down in a couple of days

OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode

I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code

It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode

All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole

So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down

No love lost, no love found



[Hook - Eminem & Lil Wayne]



It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now

You kicked me when I was down

Fuck what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)

That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you

Bitch you get (no love)

You show me nothing but hate

You ran me into the ground

But what comes around goes around

I don't need you (don't hurt me)

You (don't hurt me no more)

That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you

You get (no love)

Bitch you get (no love)

And I don't need you

Get em



[Verse 2 - Eminem]



I'm alive again

More alive than I have been in my whole entire life

I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin

To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most

Shit's finna get thick again

They say the competition is stiff

But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in

I ain't never giving in again

Cuss into the wind, complete freedom

Look at these rappers, how I treat them

So why the fuck would I join them when I beat them?

They call me a freak because

I like to spit on these pussies fore I eat them

Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage

Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?

Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute

Yeah the rap is tight

But I'm fucking with the greatest verse of all time

So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um

Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit

And start over from scratch and write new ones

But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference

When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump

In the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow

Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd

You can see the sparks from hot metal

Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game

I so started to rock fellow

When I'm not even in my harshest

You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow

Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop

I'm standing on my Monopoly board

That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop

Til my hip don't hop anymore

When you so good that you can't say it

Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore

People just get sick cause you spit

These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you can never break my stride

You never slow the momentum; at any moment I'm about to blow

You'll never take my pride

Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent

Is getting no mercy, mark my words

Ain't letting up, relentless

I smell blood, I don't give a fuck: keep giving them hell

Where was you when I fell and needed help up?

You get no love.

We clutch it isnt much
But its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
Its lust its torcherous
You must be a socerous cause you just
Did the impossible

Game I trust dont play games itll be dangerous

If you fuck me over

Cause if I get burnt imma show you what its like to hurt

Cause I been treated like dirt before ya

And love is evil

Spell it backwards I'll show ya



Nobody knows me I'm cold

Walk down this road all alone

Its noones fault but my own

Its the path ive chosen to go

Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so

Dont ask me why I have no love for these mufuckin hos

Bloodsuckin suckubusses what the fuck is up with this

Ive tried in this department but I aint had no luck with this



Its sucks but its exactly what I thought it would be

Like tryin to start over

I gotta hole in my heart I'm some kind of emotional rollercoaster

Somethin I wont go on til you toy with my emotion so its over

Its like an explosion everytime I hold ya wasnt jokin when I told ya

Ya take my breathe away

Your a supernova.. and I'm a



I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

250 thousand miles and a clear night in june

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

Right at you



I do whatever it takes

When I'm with you I get the shakes

My body aikes when I aint

With you I have zero strength

Theres no limit on how far I would go

No boundries no lengths

Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks

Gonna be that one and then once we get em its never the same



You want them when they dont want you

Soon as they do feelings change

Its not a contest and I aint on no conquest for no mate

I wasnt lookin but I stumbled onto you mustve been fate

But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take

Lets cut to the chase

But a door shuts in your face

Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open

That I wont be makin a mistake



I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

250 thousand miles and a clear night in june

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

Right at you



So after a year and 6 months its no longer me that you want

But I love you so much it hurts

Never mistreated you once

I poured my heart out to you

Let down my guard swear to god

Ill blow my brains in your lap

Lay here and die in your arms

Up to my knees and I'm bleedin



Im tryin to stop you from leavin

You wont even listen so fuck it

Im tryin to stop you from breathin

I put both hands on your throat

I sit on top of you squeezin

Til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick

Aint no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house



And let you live

Tears streamed down both of my cheeks

Then I let you just go and just give

And before I put that gun to my temple

I told you this



And I would do anything for you

To show you how much I adored you

But its over now

Its too late to save our love

Just promise me youll think of me everytime you look up in the sky and see a star cause imma



I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

250 thousand miles and a clear night in june

And I'm so lost without you

So lost without you

Without you

Without you"

I'm taking my life back)

Caught in a chase, 25 to life



I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made

Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed

But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid

Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain

Bitch, you took me for granted

Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet

Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it

Now my respect, I demand it

I'ma take control of this relationship, command it

And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it

And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me

So you better hear me out, this much you owe me

I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed

Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?

Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess

Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet

Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect

I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness

And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left

But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step

And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath

You know what you've done, no need to go in depth

I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left

I laughed while you wept, how's it feel now?

Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me

Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set

But a special place for you in my heart I have kept

It's unfortunate, but it's…

Too late for the other side

Caught in a chase, 25 to life



I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh

‘Cause that ain't good enough

You expect me to fold myself in half 'til I snap

Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap

How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that

Don't I give you enough of my time?

You don't think so, do you?

Jealous when I spend time with the girls

Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know

But tonight I'm serving you with papers

I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!

And take away their freedom like you did to me

Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you

Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat

I'm moving on, forget you

Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you

All I ever felt was this helplessness

Imprisoned by a selfish bitch

Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this

So many times it's ridiculous

And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this

But in my sickness and addiction you're addictive as they get

Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em

My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from

I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama

I'm drawn to shit, I guess I'm a

Mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I

Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss

You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed

But when you spoke of people

Who meant the most to you, you left me off your list

Fuck you, Hip-Hop! I'm leavin' you

My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just…

[scratches] I can't call it

Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!

Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin

What you mean we aint fuckin', you take me for a friend?

Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin

You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!

Now, it all started with my father

I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama

I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Trauma (??)

Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise

There aint nobody as bomb as, me I'm as calm as

The breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a

S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!

Why you think the only thing I got on is my pyjamas?



[Chorus x2]

So bad

So good that I'm so bad

Guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had

Cause you aint never met nobody like me

And you aint gonna want no-fucking-body else at that..



I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel

Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table

But you may wanna find something more stable

I told you I aint fooling from the gate, this aint the first day of april!

But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you learn

To appreciate me, differentiate me

From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's

Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissyface, please

Initiate phase three! Missy now service me

Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously

Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!

Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!

I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?

Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you

Got a twisted sense of humour, it's warped, but I didn't hit you

I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm..



[Chorus x2]



[Bridge]

Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!

Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!

I can hold you in the morning

But in the evening I gotta go..

'cause I'm on to the next girl,

And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh..!



I got you caught up in the rapture

Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped you

You never wanted someone so bad you're sweating

But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed you?

Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic

Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic

You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it

Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'

Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen

Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and

Throw your spine out of alignment

My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup

So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up

Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'ma hang a sign up

Saying ""Don't Disturb"", shorty I'm so superb

I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?



[Chorus x2]



[Bridge]



[Chorus x2]

[Over the chorus] Haha..

Dr. Dre

2010!

Light years ahead of you..haha..

Yeah, can't stop now...
This maybe the last chance I get, to be famous
(Hook)



You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces

You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose

Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless

There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes



I just wanna be famous



But be careful what you wish for!



(Verse 1)



I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Rothelsberger

I get beserker than a fed up post office worker

A murker with a mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered

Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter

For a gangsta, you should of shit your pants when you saw

The chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel

I faced her around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out

That's what I call blowing your mind, when I come back like nut on your spine

I'm a thumbtac that you slept on son

Now here I come screaming ""attack"" like I stepped on one!

Lowering the totem til' he showed 'em, defiance, giant scrotum

He don't owe them bitches shit, his bridges, he out wrote 'em

He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the south pole and

Nobody fucks with him, rigamortis and post-mortem

He's dying of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em

Then try to thwart him, he'll take your punchlines and snort 'em

Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck with the guy that licks the blades of his chainsaws

While he dips 'em in P.F. chang's sauce

Game's off homie, hang it up like some crank calls

You think I'm backing down, you must be out your dang skulls!

I'm almost famous





(Hook)



You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces

You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose

Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless

There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes



I just wanna be famous



But be careful what you wish for!



(Verse 2)



I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happening again

I'm at your throat like strep, I step strapped with a pen

Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are distorting my mem-ory

Some are wrote on a napkin, do what I have to to win

Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior

Is not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers

And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the whacko 'for

I take a shit in his jackolantern then smash it on his porch

Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick

Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick!

Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer

I just blew up the challenger, matter of fact, I need a lawyer

I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast

Beat his ass naked and pee'd in his corner like Verne Troyer

Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're menime's

See he's in a-whole-nother weight class, his slugs your BB's

Your bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissing his CD's

Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheeties

No peace treaty's, he's turned into a beast

His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the might DRE

He's almost famous



(Hook)



You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces

You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose

Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless

There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes



I just wanna be famous



But be careful what you wish for!



(Verse 3)



Now there he goes, in Dre's studio, cupping his balls

Screaming the wood off the panelling, cussing the paint off the walls

Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads

He ain't giving 'em shit, he's scissor pinch a penny so hard

He'll leave a bruise on the brawn so dark

You can see the mark when it scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out ""AHHH!""

His metaphors and similies ain't similar to them not at all

If they don't like they can all get fucked, instead of sucking him off

They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by

Like David Carridy, they can go fuck themselves and just die

And eat shit while they at it, he's fucking had it

He's mad at the whole world, so go to hell and build a snowman, girl

The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed

They better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me

Cause I ain't looking back only forward, this whole spot blowing

Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it

And while I'm being poetic, let me get a stork

And raise the bar higher than my opinion of these women ?

So bare witness to some biblical shit

As the cold wind blowing, this world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it, he's finally famous!

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is

I can only tell you what it feels like

And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe

I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight

As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate

It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer

I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown

She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, and I love it

Wait, where you going?, I'm leaving you

No, you ain't, come back!

We're running right back, here we go again

It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great

I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed

I snap, Who's that dude?, I don't even know his name

I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again

I guess I don't know my own strength



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



You ever love somebody so much

You can barely breathe when you're with them?

You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them

Got that warm fuzzy feeling

Yeah, them chills used to get them

Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them?

You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them

Now you're in each other's face

Spewing venom in your words when you spit them

You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them

Throw them down, pin them

So lost in the moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls you both

So they say it's best to go your separate ways

Guess that they don't know you

'Cause today, that was yesterday

Yesterday is over, it's a different day

Sound like broken records playing over

But you promised her next time you'd show restraint

You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game

But you lied again

Now you get to watch her leave out the window

Guess that's why they call it window pane



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



Now, I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean

And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines

But your temper's just as bad as mine is

You're the same as me

When it comes to love, you're just as blinded

Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me

Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems

Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano

All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk

Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?

Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball

Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall

Next time? There won't be no next time

I apologize even though I know it's lies

I'm tired of the games, I just want her back

I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again

I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie"

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over



(Verse 1)



If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud

Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found

That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now

You try, it'll be them doors, Andre's phatom, believe me clowns

That means suicide homie, you'll never throw me

Off of this course, blow me

Bitch I do this all for the sport only

But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards homie

And the balls in my court, and it's lonely

On top of the world when you're the only

One with the balls in your shorts

To leave them jaws on the floor with no re-

morse, remember that when they get to doggin' you boy homie

So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna

I'm not gonna stop the saga

Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi

I'm moppin the floors with them, I keep tryna pass it

But they keep on droppin' the torch

And it won't be, long til this sport is O-V-

E-R, Just Blaz and we knockin' them doors and no we

ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be

Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me

Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P

Let me guide you through the smoke G

If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely

No one who knew me like you will ever know me

I don't think you understand how much you meant to me



(Hook)



The days are cold, livin' without you

The nights are long, I'm growing older

I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you

You may be gone, but you're never over



And it don't stop (oh)

And it don't quit (oh)

And it don't stop (oh)

And it don't quit (oh)

And I miss you (oh)

I just miss you (oh)

(Verse 2)



For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life

So sick it'll blow up the mic, It'll put the dyna in mite

Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit hisself

Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself

Yeah it's the best thing I could do, right now for you Doodi is to rap

Sp I'mma fuck til' I die, yeah I'mma do it to death

And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life

Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'mma need two mics

Cuz the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right

There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped

Just finished the rhyme and bust it and excuse the corny metaphor

They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered

So God just help me out while I fight through this greivin' process

Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous

But this depression ain't takin me hostage

I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways

You had faith in me always

Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes

Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards

And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em homes

I'll own so many belts the only place they can hit me is below 'em

Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same with you

I woulda never came in this game, I'm going insane without you

Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you

You told me to get up, I got up and spread my wings and I flew

You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you

You told me nah Dudey, you're not layin' on that table I knew

I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew

There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof

Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you

Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think I don't feel grateful, I do

Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through

So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you

I love you Dudey

Aw man, yea
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?
[Verse 1:]

You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, your pissed

You just wanna get someone with shit, jump em [? ]

You're bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away

I'm splitting your shit wide open, no stitches could save

So die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way

You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid

Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say isn't this great

On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate

They're starting to take place in the middle of the street

Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat

Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene, but it's too late

It's absolute pandemonium, whisked away

In a ambulance is your fate, nothing nobody told you when you-

Left your house today coulda made you anticipate

Such an ass whooping, okay, til the anger dissipates

You get punched in the face, reciprocate



[Chorus: x2]

So what the deal, ridaz?

Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?

My balls are feeling a-mighty big now

I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches

I said...



[Verse 2:]

You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case

Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies

You better go get your mase cause shady said so

You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face

That's how f-king rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?

If you don't wanna get the shit beat outta you, chill

Cause if you doubt me you will, yea got me a pill, found me a thrill

I got a couple of drinks here and I'm bound to refill

Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?

This c-ksucker did not spill my drink, Oh HELL no

He must be tryna kill my buzz, I will not budge

And what the deal ridaz?

Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat

That's probably a record yea, you wasn't expecting that

Cause they want in on the act, there's a cognac-

Bottle, we snuck it in cause the beer that they were serving here was only tap

I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts

You're frightened like this guy might hurt me

You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder

Play smarter, you may start a [? ] you need a chainsaw to

Dig your way out of, go powder your nose-

P-sy the harder you yell, the harder I slap the shit out of you hoes

You set it off fa-ot, so now how do you spose-

We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes



[Chorus x2]



It's shear hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles

We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us

And adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing

Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe

And [? ] my signatures, ligature marks

Look at you all big with your remarks, and I swing an icepick at your heart

At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart

And dig at you and break you down like the bitch that you are

The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car

The pain inflicted upon you, it's so sick, it's bizarre

Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far

As having me wanna rip out your frickin ligaments ARGH!

You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails, for that-

You catch an open-hand slap, break off your nail like BAP!

In fact, I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves

Where's D12, I don't feel like doing this by myself

Aww shit
Yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what
Well I brought some friends with me too



Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back

I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks

Couple Xanax light a couple wax candles then black out

And relapse til I yack Jack Daniels and yap, burp bubbles

Attitudes immaturing, double shot of bacardi party

Vision is blurring, waa hooo I can't see shit

My words get to slurring

Uh oh, you can call me R Kelly now or your in trouble

What's incurring before after enduring the show

Has no baring on the bad news I'm baring

Whoa what is it word play

No I'm pushing you out the dumps

So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow

Then stomp your fucking feet till you get to squishing a hoe

It's panda-monium [? ] when you see him, damn

Baby you look good you're giving me wood

You should pull over like a sweat shirt with a hood

[? ] you and me both

Break bread while I'm copping over this game

Now pinch a loaf now homie who's your favourite pain in the ass

Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me

I'm Kanye when he crashed

In otherwords I got the hood on smash

Like I stepped on the gas destroyed the front end

Deployed the damn airbags from the dash

Went through 'em and laughed

Came back an hour after the accident and bit

A god-damn jaw-breaker in half

So stop [? ] the funk and start shaking ya ass

Slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasion rapping

Just Blaze on the track

What the fuck is more amazing than that slut

Answer me that, Royce where you at?



[Royce da 5'9"":]

I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers

Are prying you apart[? ], lump on your head designed by a bar-stool

Designed by a cartoon, before I need to be hired

Jimmy 'Io fire Marshall

The 9 tucked against the lining

I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like ya'll are a couple 69ing

It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga... fuck your couch nigga!

You screaming 'fuck the world' with your middle finger up

While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud

My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit for murder

Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel the OJ the Glove

I got a Posse of Insane Clowns; blow your brains on your opposite ear

Then ask you how your brain sounds

Bad, evil, weirdo, Alfred [? ], mad cerebral, you on your last burrito!

(What that mean Nickel?)

It's a rap if you eating, get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern

Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touching that

Good day and good night, Ortiz where the fuck you at?



[Joel Ortiz:]

I'm right here; my Nike Airs buzz light-years ahead of my mic peers

Quite scary to look at, a nightmare, where my book at I'll write fear-

In the heart of you tight squares, I harbour the art of you nice [? ]

It's [? ] cause that made me hotter than my dear

Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his 9th beer

Homie chill listen, I swear, I'm God; I give tracks a holy feel (Holyfield)

And they bite ears

I'm right here, why wouldn't I be, just waiting to be hooked to IV's-

[? ] brown when you look at my pee

And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction, and record the pig's oink-

When I rip his intestines

This isn't just an infection; this won't go away with penicillin injections-

Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection

What I exhibit, seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it

Aww shit I did it again, when I lit with this pen, I admitted this phlegm-

This time along side Em and the Em

So tell a friend to tell a friend, write a disgusting hook

Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?



[Crooked I:]

I'm right here letting the shotty pop

Quick as a karate chop, get your body shot, get your top chopped like a lollipop

Come with Maserati drop, in the body shot

Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped

I take your life to the 9th inning

A knife in a gunfight I love it me and my knife winning

I laugh when you fall the shit will be funny

I buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money

Man all the bitches holla, they wanna drop my bridges than jaw my dick and swallow

Leave drawers in this Impala, I ball like Iguodala,

I bear more arms than 6 koalas; as soon as a I draw get sent to [? ]

I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun, I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn

Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth

Ya'll are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing

I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out

Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker

I'll show you pussy footin, I'll kick a bitch in the cunt

Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion

Who the fuck is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy

Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom

Go ahead, fucking hater push me

I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me

Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy

Man the fuck up sissy, G's up

All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)

Man chill, nah I can't god damnit

Rappers are land fill, drop the anvil

These are shoes that you can't fill

Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning

And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still

During an earthquake, urine in your face

Cause you're fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!

Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening

Alright then I quit, god I give up

Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do

This is for your sins, I cleanse you

You can repent but I warn you, if you continue

To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said



Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows

When it snows and it's twenty be-low

Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know

I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows

Oh oh oh oh oh



(Verse 3)



How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day

til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say

So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs

Like i miss the pass when I went long

If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong

Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song

Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women

When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming

Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so

So don't compare me to them other bums over there

It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah

I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair

But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you

I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune

That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme

And say I was writing this and I thought of you so



Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows

When it snows and it's twenty be-low

Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know

I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows

Oh oh oh oh oh



(Outro)



Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I don't know, I don't know what caused, I don't know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way

I don't know, I don't know by I probably be this way til my dying day

I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold beat bangs, I don't need to say

I guess this is how you made me

Ayo, before i start this song man, I just wanna thank everyone for being so patient
And bearing with me over the past few years while I figure this shit out
(Hook)



Is anybody out there, It feels like I'm talking to myself

No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I come from

Can anybody hear me yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself

Feels like I'm going insane, am I the one who's crazy



So why in the world do I feel so alone

Nobody but me, I'm on my own

Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel

That there is and let me know so I know that I'm not the only one



(Verse 1)



I went away I guess that opened up some lanes

But there was no one who even knew I was going through growing pains

Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane

I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne

It's like I was jealous of him, cause of the attention he was getting

I felt horrible about myself, he was spitting and I wasn't

Anyone who was buzzing back then could of got it

Almost went at Kanye too, god it feels like I'm going psychotic

Thank god that I didn't do it

I'd of had my ass handed to me, and I knew it

But proof isn't here to see me through it

I'm in the booth popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it

Are you stupid? You gon' start dissing people for no reason

Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even

You're lying to yourself, you're slowing dying

You're denying, your health is declining with your self esteem

you're crying out for help



(Hook)



Is anybody out there, It feels like I'm talking to myself

No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I come from

Can anybody hear me yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself

Feels like I'm going insane, am I the one who's crazy



So why in the world do I feel so alone

Nobody but me, I'm on my own

Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel

That there is and let me know so I know that I'm not the only one



(Verse 2)



Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow

All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow

Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I hit my bottom tomorrow

My sorrow echos in this hall though

But I must be talking to the wall though, I don't see nobody else

(I guess I keep talking to myself)

But all these other rappers suck is all that I know

I've turned into a hater, I put up a false mavado

But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto

He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled

Inside him, one foot on the brake, one of the throttle

Falling asleep with writers block in the parking lot of Mcdonalds

But instead of feeling sorry for yourself, do something about it

Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded

You're powdered long enough, It isn't them, its you, you fucking baby

Quit worrying bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fucking going crazy



(Hook)



Is anybody out there, It feels like I'm talking to myself

No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I come from

Can anybody hear me yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself

Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel

That there is and let me know so I know that I'm not the only one



(Verse 3)



So I picked myself up off the ground, and fucking swam before I drowned

Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, advice this time around

It's different, them last 2 albums didn't count

Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out

I've come to make it up to you, now no more fucking around

I got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I let 'em down

So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal

I feel like me again, let me formally re-introduce myself

To you for those of you who don't know

The new me's back to the old me, and homie I don't show no

Signs of slowing or bowing, I'm blowing up all over

My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over homos

I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep your head up

T.I. keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up

Don't let up, just keep slaying em

Rest in peace to DJ AM, cause I know what this shit is like

I struggle with this shit every single day and I'm

(Outro)



So there it is, damn, feels like i just woke up or something

Guess I just forgot who the fuck I was man

Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at, It was never nothing personal

Just some shit that I was going through

And to the rest of you, I'm back!

Yeah... ya know, critics man
Critics never got nothing nice to say man
You know the one thing I notice about critics man...
Is, critics never ask me how my day went

well Imma tell 'em



(Verse 1)



Ah, yesterday my dog died, i hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow

Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow

You wanna criticize dog, try a little more

I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole

I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro

Better hold on a little tighter here i go

Flows tighter, as hot headed as Ghostrider

Cold hearted as Spiderman, throwin' a spider in the snow

So you better get to blowing in flow rider

Inside of a Lowrider with no tires in the hole

Why am I like this? why is winter cold?

Why is it when I talk, im so biased to the hoes

Listen dog christmas is off this is as soft as it gets

This isnt golf this is a blistering assault

Those are your wounds this is the salt, so get lost

Shit dissin' me is just like pissin off the Wizard of Oz

Wrap a lizard in gauze, beat you in the jaws with it

Grab the scissors and saws

And, cut out your livers gizzards and balls

Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws

So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw

Then discribe how it tasted like dessert to us all

Got the gall to make chris piss in his draws

Ticklin' him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog



(Hook)



You're on fire

Thats how ya know you're on a roll

Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone elses cold

You're on fire

Man im so fuckin sick I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit

You're on fire

Ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop to blow

You're on fire, you're on fire



(Verse 2)



I just put a bullshit hook in between two long ass verse

If you mistook the for a song, look

This aint a song, its a warnin to Brooke, Hogan and David Cook

That the crook just took over so book

Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it

I'm lightening in a skillet, you're a fuckin flash in the pan

I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan

Mr Mathers is the man

Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can

Come back and whip your ass with it again

Salivas like sulfuric acid in your hand

It'll eat through anything metal, the ass of iron man

Turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin chance is assanine

Yeah ask Denaun, man

Hit a blind man with a coloring book

And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon

Fuck it, I ain't playin

Pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin a sign sayin'

Vietnam Vet, im out my fuckin mind man

Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him 9 grand

So if I seem a little mean to you, this aint savage you ain't never seen the brew

You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route

You couldn't make a belemic puke on a piece of fuckin corn and peanut ??

Sayin' you sick, quit playin you prick dont nobody care

Then why the fuck am I yellin' at air?

I ain't even talkin to no one, cause ain't nobody there

Nobody will fuckin test me cause these hoes wont even dare

I'm wastin punchlines but I got so many to spare

I just thought of another one that might go here

Nah dont waste it, save it psycho yeah

Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said 'bout Michael's hair



(Hook)



You're on fire

Thats how ya know you're on a roll

Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone elses cold

You're on fire

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
[Eminem]
Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for __ like Philly,

I feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely,

I apologize if all that I sound like, is I'm complaining,

But life keeps on complicating, an' I'm debating,

On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,

Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it,

But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty,

When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help.

I can't do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs,

Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,

Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.

I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors,

I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?

I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,

I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,

Shit..



[Chorus]



[Eminem]

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon,

Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you.

Marshall what happened at you, you can't stop with these pills,

And you've fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin' at you.

It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up,

Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.

Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,

They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,

Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,

He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first,

But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse,

Now I'm poppin Vic's, perks and Methadone pills.

Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,

Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like ""yes man"",

And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it,

It's in their best interest to protect their investment.

And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then...



[Chorus]



Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...



My friends just can't understand this new me,

That's understandable man, but just think how bananas you'd be,

You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.

And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do,

I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is,

Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.

I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin' the same damn DVD,

Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.

And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright.

And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night,

I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right,

I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.

Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, don't look now,

Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.

Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice,

Yeah baby hold me down.



[Chorus]



[Eminem]

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I'm pullin' through.

Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof.

I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,

Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.

Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?

I think about the things I would never got to say to you,

I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do.

Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,

I still love your mother, that'll never change,

Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.

Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,

But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day.

There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,

Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain.

But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame,

I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint.

I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history,

But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,

I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way.

But I just had to get away, don't know why,

I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm..

I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyric off of this paper before I lay 'em

But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em

'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem

When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world

Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me

I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably

And all those who look down on me

I'm tearin' down your balcony

No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or ""how can he""

From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's

Still shittin', whether he's on salary, paid hourly

Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse

He's married to the game

Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas: his gift is a curse

Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt

And fuck the whole Universe



I'm not afraid to take a stand

Everybody, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road



Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap

I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm

For you to know it's a wrap

You said you was king, you lied through your teeth

For that, fuck your feelings

Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back

I promise to never go back on that promise

In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhhh

Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now

All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack BLAOW

Cause I ain't playin' around

There's a game called circle and I don't know how

I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out

Thought I had it mapped out

But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud

Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons

These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now



I'm not afraid to take a stand

Everybody, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road



And I just can't keep livin' this way

So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage

I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons

I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground

I've had enough, now I'm so fed up

Time to put my life back together right now



It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me

Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you

So I could come back a brand-new me

You helped see me through

And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I've been through the wringer

But they can do little to the middle finger

I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of

My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers

And drop dead: no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise

To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father

So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters

And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it

Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club

Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up

Cause I'm raisin' the bar

I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars

I feel amazin', and I'm



I'm not afraid to take a stand

Everybody, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

Feels strange but um, I guess it's kinda like... it's kinda like

I feel like I'm morphin, into something so indcredible, that I'm dwarfin'

All competetors, better get your girlfriend in check

It's psychological warfare, endorphin side-effect

Your self esteem shatters his dialect

Comes blasting out your deck, she loves me

So much passion you'd expect this sort reaction from her yet

Your strong oh, you're fucking corny, you try to turn your charm on

Cause you just think you're Bishop the don one

But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one

I'm cockin' my head back like 'Ed Lover, come on son

She's on my johnson, she brings my name up constant

Your boys are like ""she's fucking with dude, she wants son""

Homeboy, you better get a clue

She's on my dick cause I spit better than you

What you expect her to do? How you expect her to act in the sack

When she's closing her eyes, fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track

Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you



Seduction, seduce

She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you

Than to count the things that are

There's a seven disc, CD changer in her car

And I'm in every single slot, and you're not, awww

I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star

And I'm not about to sick back and just keep rhyming one syllable, nah

Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up, cause they're just not good enough

But I'm not giving up til I get my respect, and I won't stop til I get enough

Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations, aww

That hater alarm is sounding off, and Obama took the bomb from my name, aww

So quit crying that I took your dame, homie she's my dame, aww

You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game boy

And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came for it

You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy

But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?

It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man I can't call it



(Hook)



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you



(Verse 3)



It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear

You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker

Dear, while I freak this world premier

Seducing her, loosen up with a little freestyle

Wait, am I losing ya? Am I making you look bad?

Well I got news for ya homie, you're losing her

Oh wait she don't like when I spit it fast

Am I tryna show how, let me slow it down

It's still gonna be a blowout

You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album

Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something

To see if you can save any of it punk, but none of it's fucking with me

Prick you really feeling that bullshit?

You think you killing them syllables? quit playing

These beats ain't nothing to fool with

They call me fire Marshall, I shut the shit down

Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round

I am also the opposite of what you are like

You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic

I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck

She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck

From sucking my dick, aww fuck



(Hook)



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you



Seduction, seduce

Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't

She's been stolen from you

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""fuck the world"", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers

I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour

Married to the game but she broke her vows

That's why my bars are full of broken bottles

And my night stands are full of open Bibles

I think about more than I forget

But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat

And these niggas know I lay them down, make their bed

Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg

Money outweighing problems on the triple beam

I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes

Be good or be good at it

Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic

Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's ""fuck what they say""

I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away

Man, I come down in a couple of days

OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode

I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code

It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode

All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole

So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down

No love lost, no love found



[Hook - Eminem & Lil Wayne]



It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now

You kicked me when I was down

Fuck what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)

That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you

Bitch you get (no love)

You show me nothing but hate

You ran me into the ground

But what comes around goes around

I don't need you (don't hurt me)

You (don't hurt me no more)

That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you

You get (no love)

Bitch you get (no love)

And I don't need you

Get em



[Verse 2 - Eminem]



I'm alive again

More alive than I have been in my whole entire life

I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin

To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most

Shit's finna get thick again

They say the competition is stiff

But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in

I ain't never giving in again

Cuss into the wind, complete freedom

Look at these rappers, how I treat them

So why the fuck would I join them when I beat them?

They call me a freak because

I like to spit on these pussies fore I eat them

Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage

Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?

Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute

Yeah the rap is tight

But I'm fucking with the greatest verse of all time

So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um

Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit

And start over from scratch and write new ones

But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference

When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump

In the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow

Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd

You can see the sparks from hot metal

Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game

I so started to rock fellow

When I'm not even in my harshest

You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow

Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop

I'm standing on my Monopoly board

That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop

Til my hip don't hop anymore

When you so good that you can't say it

Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore

People just get sick cause you spit

These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you can never break my stride

You never slow the momentum; at any moment I'm about to blow

You'll never take my pride

Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent

Is getting no mercy, mark my words

Ain't letting up, relentless

I smell blood, I don't give a fuck: keep giving them hell

Where was you when I fell and needed help up?

You get no love.

We clutch it isnt much
But its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
Its lust its torcherous
You must be a socerous cause you just
Did the impossible

Game I trust dont play games itll be dangerous

If you fuck me over

Cause if I get burnt imma show you what its like to hurt

Cause I been treated like dirt before ya

And love is evil

Spell it backwards I'll show ya



Nobody knows me I'm cold

Walk down this road all alone

Its noones fault but my own

Its the path ive chosen to go

Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so

Dont ask me why I have no love for these mufuckin hos

Bloodsuckin suckubusses what the fuck is up with this

Ive tried in this department but I aint had no luck with this



Its sucks but its exactly what I thought it would be

Like tryin to start over

I gotta hole in my heart I'm some kind of emotional rollercoaster

Somethin I wont go on til you toy with my emotion so its over

Its like an explosion everytime I hold ya wasnt jokin when I told ya

Ya take my breathe away

Your a supernova.. and I'm a



I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

250 thousand miles and a clear night in june

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

Right at you



I do whatever it takes

When I'm with you I get the shakes

My body aikes when I aint

With you I have zero strength

Theres no limit on how far I would go

No boundries no lengths

Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks

Gonna be that one and then once we get em its never the same



You want them when they dont want you

Soon as they do feelings change

Its not a contest and I aint on no conquest for no mate

I wasnt lookin but I stumbled onto you mustve been fate

But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take

Lets cut to the chase

But a door shuts in your face

Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open

That I wont be makin a mistake



I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

250 thousand miles and a clear night in june

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

Right at you



So after a year and 6 months its no longer me that you want

But I love you so much it hurts

Never mistreated you once

I poured my heart out to you

Let down my guard swear to god

Ill blow my brains in your lap

Lay here and die in your arms

Up to my knees and I'm bleedin



Im tryin to stop you from leavin

You wont even listen so fuck it

Im tryin to stop you from breathin

I put both hands on your throat

I sit on top of you squeezin

Til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick

Aint no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house



And let you live

Tears streamed down both of my cheeks

Then I let you just go and just give

And before I put that gun to my temple

I told you this



And I would do anything for you

To show you how much I adored you

But its over now

Its too late to save our love

Just promise me youll think of me everytime you look up in the sky and see a star cause imma



I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon

And I aim it right at you

Right at you

250 thousand miles and a clear night in june

And I'm so lost without you

So lost without you

Without you

Without you"

Send the fellow shady dang came to rap the game up

And sell the fame,

Raise hell from hell he came,

But didn't come to bore you with the cinderella story,

Nor did he come to do the same,

He cant afford to be a label in this day in age,

And at this stage of the game

Mediocrity cannot be allowed to fly,

So say bye,

To the O H I,

To the new case of rock

Consider it as last of rod,

Coop degraw

Raise em high in the sky,

Keep em up

Time to bring the place alive,

Thanks for bein patient

I will make no more mistakes,

Shit my potatoes baked,

Homie the veggies on my plate can fly,

My filet is smoking weed,

Get back if the steaks are high,

Shit I aint even suppose to be here

By the grace of god,

The skin on my teeth

And the hair on my nuts

I skated by,

Now y'all are on thin ice

With anchor weights I hate to lie,

How fuckin irritated are you,

How much in ya face am i,

It aint shit you could do beferret,

Prove us here in spirit

Im the spittinn image

When I stand near it,

Heres a clue.

Lost his nike shoe, its in ya ass, he's in ya ass,

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late
(I can't keep chasing 'em

I'm taking my life back)

Caught in a chase, 25 to life



I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made

Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed

But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid

Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain

Bitch, you took me for granted

Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet

Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it

Now my respect, I demand it

I'ma take control of this relationship, command it

And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it

And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me

So you better hear me out, this much you owe me

I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed

Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?

Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess

Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet

Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect

I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness

And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left

But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step

And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath

You know what you've done, no need to go in depth

I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left

I laughed while you wept, how's it feel now?

Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me

Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set

But a special place for you in my heart I have kept

It's unfortunate, but it's…



Too late for the other side

Caught in a chase, 25 to life

(Can't take no more)

Too late for the other side

Caught in a chase, 25 to life



I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh

‘Cause that ain't good enough

You expect me to fold myself in half 'til I snap

Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap

How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that

Don't I give you enough of my time?

You don't think so, do you?

Jealous when I spend time with the girls

Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know

But tonight I'm serving you with papers

I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!

And take away their freedom like you did to me

Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you

Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat

I'm moving on, forget you

Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you

All I ever felt was this helplessness

Imprisoned by a selfish bitch

Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this

So many times it's ridiculous

And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this

But in my sickness and addiction you're addictive as they get

Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em

My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from

I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama

I'm drawn to shit, I guess I'm a

Mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I

Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss

You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed

But when you spoke of people

Who meant the most to you, you left me off your list

Fuck you, Hip-Hop! I'm leavin' you

My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just…

Caught in a chase 25 to life

Too late

Yeah, I feel it too.

You know..i'm so glad we could spend this time together

I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling,

I'm right back on 'em, with the

[scratches] I can't call it

Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!

Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin

What you mean we aint fuckin', you take me for a friend?

Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin

You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!

Now, it all started with my father

I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama

I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Trauma (??)

Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise

There aint nobody as bomb as, me I'm as calm as

The breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a

S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!

Why you think the only thing I got on is my pyjamas?



[Chorus x2]

So bad

So good that I'm so bad

Guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had

Cause you aint never met nobody like me

And you aint gonna want no-fucking-body else at that..



I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel

Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table

But you may wanna find something more stable

I told you I aint fooling from the gate, this aint the first day of april!

But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you learn

To appreciate me, differentiate me

From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's

Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissyface, please

Initiate phase three! Missy now service me

Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously

Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!

Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!

I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?

Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you

Got a twisted sense of humour, it's warped, but I didn't hit you

I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm..



[Chorus x2]



[Bridge]

Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!

Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!

I can hold you in the morning

But in the evening I gotta go..

'cause I'm on to the next girl,

And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh..!



I got you caught up in the rapture

Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped you

You never wanted someone so bad you're sweating

But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed you?

Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic

Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic

You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it

Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'

Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen

Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and

Throw your spine out of alignment

My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup

So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up

Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'ma hang a sign up

Saying ""Don't Disturb"", shorty I'm so superb

I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

Yeah, can't stop now...
This maybe the last chance I get, to be famous
(Hook)



You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces

You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose

Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless

There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes



I just wanna be famous



But be careful what you wish for!



(Verse 1)



I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Rothelsberger

I get beserker than a fed up post office worker

A murker with a mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered

Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter

For a gangsta, you should of shit your pants when you saw

The chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel

I faced her around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out

That's what I call blowing your mind, when I come back like nut on your spine

I'm a thumbtac that you slept on son

Now here I come screaming ""attack"" like I stepped on one!

Lowering the totem til' he showed 'em, defiance, giant scrotum

He don't owe them bitches shit, his bridges, he out wrote 'em

He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the south pole and

Nobody fucks with him, rigamortis and post-mortem

He's dying of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em

Then try to thwart him, he'll take your punchlines and snort 'em

Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck with the guy that licks the blades of his chainsaws

While he dips 'em in P.F. chang's sauce

Game's off homie, hang it up like some crank calls

You think I'm backing down, you must be out your dang skulls!

I'm almost famous





(Hook)



You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces

You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose

Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless

There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes



I just wanna be famous



But be careful what you wish for!



(Verse 2)



I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happening again

I'm at your throat like strep, I step strapped with a pen

Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are distorting my mem-ory

Some are wrote on a napkin, do what I have to to win

Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior

Is not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers

And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the whacko 'for

I take a shit in his jackolantern then smash it on his porch

Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick

Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick!

Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer

I just blew up the challenger, matter of fact, I need a lawyer

I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast

Beat his ass naked and pee'd in his corner like Verne Troyer

Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're menime's

See he's in a-whole-nother weight class, his slugs your BB's

Your bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissing his CD's

Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheeties

No peace treaty's, he's turned into a beast

His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the might DRE

He's almost famous



(Hook)



You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces

You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose

Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless

There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes



I just wanna be famous



But be careful what you wish for!



(Verse 3)



Now there he goes, in Dre's studio, cupping his balls

Screaming the wood off the panelling, cussing the paint off the walls

Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads

He ain't giving 'em shit, he's scissor pinch a penny so hard

He'll leave a bruise on the brawn so dark

You can see the mark when it scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out ""AHHH!""

His metaphors and similies ain't similar to them not at all

If they don't like they can all get fucked, instead of sucking him off

They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by

Like David Carridy, they can go fuck themselves and just die

And eat shit while they at it, he's fucking had it

He's mad at the whole world, so go to hell and build a snowman, girl

The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed

They better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me

Cause I ain't looking back only forward, this whole spot blowing

Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it

And while I'm being poetic, let me get a stork

And raise the bar higher than my opinion of these women ?

So bare witness to some biblical shit

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is

I can only tell you what it feels like

And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe

I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight

As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate

It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer

I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown

She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, and I love it

Wait, where you going?, I'm leaving you

No, you ain't, come back!

We're running right back, here we go again

It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great

I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed

I snap, Who's that dude?, I don't even know his name

I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again

I guess I don't know my own strength



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



You ever love somebody so much

You can barely breathe when you're with them?

You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them

Got that warm fuzzy feeling

Yeah, them chills used to get them

Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them?

You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them

Now you're in each other's face

Spewing venom in your words when you spit them

You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them

Throw them down, pin them

So lost in the moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls you both

So they say it's best to go your separate ways

Guess that they don't know you

'Cause today, that was yesterday

Yesterday is over, it's a different day

Sound like broken records playing over

But you promised her next time you'd show restraint

You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game

But you lied again

Now you get to watch her leave out the window

Guess that's why they call it window pane



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



Now, I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean

And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines

But your temper's just as bad as mine is

You're the same as me

When it comes to love, you're just as blinded

Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me

Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems

Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano

All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk

Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?

Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball

Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall

Next time? There won't be no next time

I apologize even though I know it's lies

I'm tired of the games, I just want her back

I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again

I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie"

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over



(Verse 1)



If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud

Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found

That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now

You try, it'll be them doors, Andre's phatom, believe me clowns

That means suicide homie, you'll never throw me

Off of this course, blow me

Bitch I do this all for the sport only

But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards homie

And the balls in my court, and it's lonely

On top of the world when you're the only

One with the balls in your shorts

To leave them jaws on the floor with no re-

morse, remember that when they get to doggin' you boy homie

So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna

I'm not gonna stop the saga

Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi

I'm moppin the floors with them, I keep tryna pass it

But they keep on droppin' the torch

And it won't be, long til this sport is O-V-

E-R, Just Blaz and we knockin' them doors and no we

ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be

Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me

Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P

Let me guide you through the smoke G

If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely

No one who knew me like you will ever know me

I don't think you understand how much you meant to me



(Hook)



The days are cold, livin' without you

The nights are long, I'm growing older

I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you

You may be gone, but you're never over



And it don't stop (oh)

And it don't quit (oh)

And it don't stop (oh)

And it don't quit (oh)

And I miss you (oh)

I just miss you (oh)

I just miss you (oh)

Homie, I'll never forget you (no)



(Verse 2)



For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life

So sick it'll blow up the mic, It'll put the dyna in mite

Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit hisself

Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself

Yeah it's the best thing I could do, right now for you Doodi is to rap

Sp I'mma fuck til' I die, yeah I'mma do it to death

And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life

Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'mma need two mics

Cuz the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right

There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped

Just finished the rhyme and bust it and excuse the corny metaphor

They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered

So God just help me out while I fight through this greivin' process

Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous

But this depression ain't takin me hostage

I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways

You had faith in me always

Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes

Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards

And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em homes

I'll own so many belts the only place they can hit me is below 'em

Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same with you

I woulda never came in this game, I'm going insane without you

Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you

You told me to get up, I got up and spread my wings and I flew

You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you

You told me nah Dudey, you're not layin' on that table I knew

I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew

There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof

Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you

Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think I don't feel grateful, I do

Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through

So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you

I love you Dudey



(Hook)



The days are cold, livin' without you

The nights are long, I'm growing older

I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you

You may be gone, but you're never over



And it don't stop (oh)

And it don't quit (oh)

And it don't stop (oh)

You're walkin down a horror corridor

It's almost 4 in the mornin

And your in a

Nightmare

It's HORRIBLE

Right there's the coroner

Waitin for you

To turn the corner

So he can corner ya

Your a goner

He's ona ya

Out the corner of his cornea

He just saw you run

All you want is to rest

Cause you can't run anymore

Your done

All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience

While everybody

Is watchin in the party applauding it

Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again

Contemplading my next plot again

Swallowin the Klonopin

While I'm noddin

In and out on the autumn and

If the ramada inn

Holdin onto the pill bottle then

Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom

And make sure I got all of it

Wake up naked at mcdonalds

With

Blood all over me

Dead bodies

Behind the counter

SHIT

Guess I must of just blacked out again

NOT AGAIN



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



(Verse 2)

Sitting nude in my living room

It's almost noon

I wonder what's on the tube

Maybe they'll show some boobs

Surfing every channel

Until I find hannah montana

Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin

Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin

Every candle on top of the fire place

Mantalin

Grab my flannel and my bandana then

Kiss the naked manakin man again

You can see him standin in my

Front window

If you look in

I'm just a hooligan

Who's use to usin hallicinogens

Causin illusions again

Brain contusions again

Cutting and bruising the skin

Raise the scissors and pins

Jesus when does it end

Phases that I go through

Dazed and I'm so confused

Days that I don't know who

Gave these molecules too

Me

What am I gone do

Had the prodical son

The diabolical one

Very methodical

I slaughtered them



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



(Verse 3)

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again



I duck and I slash slice and gash

Last night was a blast

I can't quite remember when I

Had that much fun

Off a half pint of the jack

My last vic and a half

A flashlight

Up kim kardashians ass



I remember the first time

I dismembered a family member

December I think it was

I was having drinks with my cuz

And I wrapped him

In christmas lights

Pushed him into the stinkin tub

Cut him up into pieces

Then just when I went to drink his

Blood

I thought I outta drink this bath water

That outta be fun

That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun

The sight of blood excites me

That might be an artery son

Your blood curdling screams

Just don't seem to bother me none

It's 3 am

And here I come

So you should probably run

A secret passage way around here

Man there's got to be one

Oh no there's probably none

He can scream all that he wants

Top of his lungs

It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)



(Chorus)

Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

[Intro:]
Yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo Yo

Alright, I'm a lay the chorus first



Here we gooo now



[Chorus:]

My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am because I'm like her



Because My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Verse 1:]

My mom, my mom,

I know your probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom, Oooh whooa

But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty

And how I become hooked on vah-a-l-ium

Valium was in everything, food that I ate

The water that I drank, fuckin peas in my plate

She sprinkled just enough of it just to season my steak

So everyday I'd have at least three stomach aches

Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her

Son to grow up to be an under-afuckin-chiever

My teacher didn't think I was gunna be nothin either

""What the fuck you stickin gum up under the fuckin seat for? ""

""Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffin ether, ""

""Either that or the motherfuckers been puffin' reefer""

But all this huffin and puffin wasn't what it was either, it was neither

I was buzzin but it wasn't what she thought

Pee in teacup? Bitch you ain't my keeper I'm sleepin

What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for

Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin

Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!



[Chorus:]

My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am cause I'm like her



Because My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Verse 2:]

Wait a minute... This ain't dinner, this is paint thinner

""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints did I?

Now heres a plate full of pain killers, now just wait till I crush the valium

And put it in your potatoes, you little motherfucker,

I'll make you sit there and make that retarded fuckin face Without even tastin it.

You better lick that fuckin' plate you ain't wastin' it, put your face in it

'Fore I throw you in the basement again, and I ain't givin' in

Your gunna just sit there in one fuckin place spi?

Till next Thanksgiving and if you still ain't finished

Then I'll use the same shit again, then When I make spinach dip

It'll be placed in the shit.

You little shit Wanna sit there and play innocent

A rack filler hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it

Child support? Your father he ain't sent the shit

And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business kid""



[Bridge 1:]

My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom

I know I should let bygones be bygones

But shes the reason why I am high what I'm high on



[Chorus:]

My mom loves valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am cause I'm like her



Because My mom loves valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Bridge 2:]

My mom loves valium now while I am

There's a party animal, I am what I am

But I'm strong to the finish with me valium spinach

But my buzz only last about two minutes

But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it

I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it

My valium, My valiiiuuuuum



[Verse 3:]

Man I never thought I could never be a drug addict

Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me

But that actually what has ended up happenin'

A tradegy, of fuckin passin it up, catchin' me

And it's probably where I got aquanted with the taste, Ain't it

Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom, beautiful

She killed a fuckin dog with the medicine she done fed it

Feed a fuckin asprin and say that it has a headache

""Here want a snack, you hungry you fuckin brat? ""

""Look at that, it's a xanax, take it and take a nap! EAT IT! ""

But I DONT NEED IT!

""WELL FUCK IT, then break it up! ""

""Take a little piece then beat it, before you wake Nathan up! ""

Alright ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'

I'll do it, pop it gobble it, and start wobblin'

Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, tripped and I fall in bed

With a bottle of Meds, and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed

""Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead? ""

After I fuck you in the butt, get some head

Bust a nut, get some rest

The next day my mother said, ""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid""

The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared

He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead

Terry don't let that fucker get you upset

Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck

I bet you he's faking it

I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get

I'll go handle this of course unless you object

Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head



[Chorus:]

If you could count the skeletons in my closet

Under my bed and up under my faucet

Then you would know I've completely lost it

Is he nuts? No, he's insane



If you could count the skeletons in my closet

Under my bed and up under my faucet

Then you would know I've completely lost it

Is he nuts? No, he's insane



[Verse 2:]

You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off

I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw

Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off

Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot

Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop

Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong

Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong

That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong

Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn

And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on

Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off

Everything except his tank top and his training bra

Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog

Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?

Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?

Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)

Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?

Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching

Burp belch and go back for a second helping

Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?

I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me

Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping

Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!

What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!

Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being

No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing

I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see

I only get naked when the babysitter tells me

She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street

But actually it was called The Pubic Hair on Chelsie

Well this is called Ass-Rape and we should do the Jail scene

Oh man, how can I describe, the way I feel
Fuckin' great man
Ok, let me see
How could I begin

[Verse 1:]

Locked in mariahs wine cellar all I had for lunch,

Was red wine more red wine and some captain crunch,

Red wine for breakfast and for brunch,

And to soak it up and in between snack, crack ers to munch

Mariah what ever happened to us

Why did we have to break up

All I asked for was a glass of punch

Ya see I never really asked for much

I can't imagine what's

Going through your mind after such

A nasty break up with that latin hunk

Luis migul

Nick cannon better back the fuck up

I'm not playin I want her back ya punk

This is hello kitty bed spread satin funk

Mixed with egyptian with a little rap and punk

Zapp and eric clapton

Shaft, prince, abba, crunk

Ya baby

I want another crack at ya

You can beat me with any spatula that you want

man I really want you bad you cunt

Nick you had your fun

I've come to kick you in your sack of junk

Man I could use a fresh batch of blood

So prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture



[Hook:]

Bagpipes from baghdad

When will it ever cease

For pete sakes he crazy to say the least

Bagpipes from baghdad

What's going through my mind

Half time when I rhyme

While blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

Somebody turn the vacancy sign on

Cause I'm gone

Blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

I run the streets and act like a mad man holding a glad...



[Verse 2:]

You could be a permanent fixture

In my lyrical mixture

I'm the miracle whip trickster

My signature sound

When a tube of lipsticks around

I'm bound to put it on in an instant

Wow man what an ensemble

What an assortment of pharma-

Ceuticals this beautiful pill does to my palm and

Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle

Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma

I'll cut you like dahmer

Pull a butcher knife on ya

The size of a sword boy

I'm like the fucking red sonja

Get it stuck in ya cornea

Nice knowing ya norman

Your so fucking annoying

Drop the shovel boy

You don't know what the fuck your doing

I ain't playing no fucking more

Nick cannon you prick I wish you luck with the fuckin whore

Every minute there's a sucker born

Snuck up on malachai

Made the motherfucker suck on shuck of corn

Chaka chaka khan chaka khan

Hit jason in the face with a hockey puck and

Told him it's fuckin on

Now what the fuck are you doing

Your running over the snow blower with the lawn mower blowing your bagpipes from baghdad



Bagpipes from baghdad

When will it ever cease

For pete sakes he crazy to say the least

Bagpipes from baghdad

What's going through my mind

Half time when I rhyme

While blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

Somebody turn the vacancy sign on

Cause I'm gone

Blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

I run the streets and act like a mad man holding a glad bag...



In a bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables

I bet you they'll become heterosexual

Nothing will stop me from molesting you

Titty-fucking you 'till your breast nipples flesh tickle my testicles

It's what they said to the two conjoined twins

How's it going, girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?

You need some ointment? just set up an appointment

Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip

I've just got my one year sobriety chip

When the bad get going how bad is it gonna get

Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with each other

Especially when they're joined at the hip

I'm going to get a needle thread sewing kit

In attempt to separate the [? ] back at the loin, shit [? ]

Lure the little boy with the chocolate chips Ahoy!

Cookie, lookie, even took me a polaroid

Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady

I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)



[Verse 1:]

You see that chick in the gym checking me out?

Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth

I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wrecking the house

That was suppose to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?

Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse

Man I should check to see if my mom left any out

Nope, guess I'll re-route

Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch

Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth

Down the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it

A rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn ratchet

A tat-tac-tac in the hall with the damn hatchet

A nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs

Shorty come back, I'm tryin to score me some lapdances

I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels

Formula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules

The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya



[Chorus 1:]

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

And are you menstruating baby, my lil friend's waiting to say Hello

The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin like Jello

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello



[Verse 2:]

My equilibrium is off, must be the Lithium

I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em

It just becomes everyday extracurriculum

No reason in particular, it was strictly fun

A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151

51 people asleep in my damn living room

Scuse me hun? But what is your name, Vivian?

I woke up next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?

Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy on?

I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one

No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm

But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from

I find the fact that you, I'm cool, I immediately run like Speedy Gon-

Zalez to see if I see anyone

Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some

My head is pounding to the beat of the drum



[Chorus 2:]

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow?

Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello



[Verse 3:]

Oh, those were the days, they certainly were

It's hurtin me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good

(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)

I second that and a third, rush to emergency sur-

-gery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged

He's no longer getting the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-odans

Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in

Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin him'

Childishly on the phone tryin to rustle up muscle relax-

-ers for his back and a couple of packs

Since now he's doubling back-wards and he stumblin back

Slipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack

Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap

Almost ended it that soon because of the fact

I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap

Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back



[Chorus 2]



And so I'm sayin...



[Outro:]

Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)

My name is Shaaady

So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)

It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)

My name is Shaaady

I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)

Yo...
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move! All over the globe

Same song and dance

Something about it man

Same song and dance

In the Pale Moonlight

Yo...



[Verse 1:]

I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl

Your kind of tookin' back by

The whole rapper thing aren't ya?

Probably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard ya

Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?

Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster

The police constantly buggin' ya non-stop

I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya

I think ya got your OnStar button inside your car stuck.

You outta gas, do you gotta flat?

I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat

I got your back

Why don't you put your laundry basket in the back

And sit up front, not askin' it's a trap

You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a rap

In broad day, with no mask for this attack

I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract

If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get ya back

C'mon



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



[Verse 2:]

The first victim I had, she was a big one

Big movie star, a party girl, big fun

She was the girl the media always picked on

In and out of rehab, every 4 to 6 months

She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts

And Nickelodeon flashed her little kids once

What an event it was, I was sitting in front

I was hooked in it the first glimpse of them buns

Seen her back stage now here's where I come in son

Look here she comes I better pull out the big guns

Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin hun

How bout a ride to rehab, get in cunt

Starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want

Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again hun

See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention

Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension

You little Wench ya, murder wasn't my intention

If I wanted to kill you it would of already been done

Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her

With sixty-six inches of extension... cord.



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



[Verse 3:]

My second victim was even bigger then the first

Pop star, icon, the whole works

She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst

Upon the scene and seen that the world was hers

She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts

It irked me and made me mad at first

I lashed out through my songs but what was really going on

Was that I had developed a crush

I just didn't know how to tell it to her...

Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?

Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons

Of, footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?

We'll settle this once and for all, I'm a tell her at dusk

Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must

Creep up, to her mansion in stilettos and just

Climb the gate and ring the bell like hello my love,

I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up!

Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?

I'll share my valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney!

I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one

Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent

I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you

Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value

Come-on toots, give me the valium alleyoop...

I'll slam dunk it in your mouth til you puke

And just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup

I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit out of you

New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit out of you

Shoot! Now show me how you move baby do how well ya do



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



Same kickin' and screamin' same cryin' and sobbin'

Same song and dance...

Same diggin' and pleadin' same yellin' and bleedin'

Same song and dance

Yeah

Same song and dance

I know

Same song and dance"

Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)

Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)

We're the ones who made you!



Back by popular demand

Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can

You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand

How does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?

Well look at all the massive masses in the stands

Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans

Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man

She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive gluteus maximus again

Squeeze it then squash it then pass it to a friend

Can he come back as nasty as he can?

Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend

But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men

Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten

I know you want me girl, in fact I see ya grin

Now come in girl!

The enforcer, look at the more women to torture

Walk up to the cutest girl and charlie-horse her

Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres

Have that I don't? Are you tellin' me tenderness?

Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman

Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine

And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then

Nail her, ""Baby, say hello to my little friend""

Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middleman

Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again

And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge

Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention

And little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench

Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch

They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim's

I know you want me girl

'Cause I can see you're checkin' me out

And baby, you know, you know you want me too

Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you



Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa

Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?

You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album

Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but

Jessica Alba, put a breast on my mouth, bruh

Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers

And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt

Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit

I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica

Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya

Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake

Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake

With a sawblade in it to make my jailbreak

Baby, I think you just met your soulmate

Now break it down, girl!

Oh my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no! I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop it

[Verse 1:]

Welcome to the slim shady Mecca Rebeca

It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca

It's my sector homosexual dissector

Come again, rewind selector

I said nice rectum I had a visectomy Hector

So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya

Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya

I tantalize ya in and less than 5 seconds I get ya

They say once bitten and twice shy

Well I'm next to the guy with 9 extacy pills and 5 extra

Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yessir

I took the rest of the lunesta pills from my dresser

It's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?

Drop kick the bitch before her second trimester

Perform a home abortion with Dexter then I guess I

Dig the fetus out with the wire hanging and digest her



[Chorus:]

I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Let's begin, now hand me the pen

How should I begin it and where does it all end?

The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in (I said)

I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Let's begin, now hand me the pen

How should I begin it and where does it all end?

My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends



[Verse 2:]

All my westside bitches throw it up

Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up

Man I think that he just fell up the teat and shown enough

So you better change the station and keep them throwin up

Man you seen it all before, you are too familiar with it

There's a penis on floor and two balls, so you know who did it?

You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't

I won't rape all The Pussy Cat Dolls' and then call you Kitten

Now I'll pee on Rhianna, see man I do what I wanna

Spray perfume in her sauna room, Krazy Gluing Madonna

To the Lay-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her

Imagine the visual for that man, who would've thought I

Could ever be such a relentless prick

Unleashin his vengance for the chick

So old she looks like she outlived her life sentence

I never ment this rhyme to be so offensive

If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand

Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand

Here you need a hand big man? grab hold of this branch

With both hands but they don't understand I'm just a sick man

Now everybody's pissed at me

Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words geez

So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves

Won't you brake it down for me and just spit the verse please?



Eminem I'm coming to kill you (sniff)

I've always hated you and I still do

You'll never fill my shoes, my superman costume (sniff)

Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you

You're taking this shit too far (sniff)

Who do you think you are? In my suit up in the armoire

Everyday I hate you more and more, throw down the carboard

Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore

I compose art like the ghost of Mozart

Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't

Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?

Where do they go? God only knows

(Stay wide awake)

3-5-4-4

I think I smell the scent of a placenta

I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December

I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender

Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta

Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-

-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea

Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya

I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda

Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-

-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-

-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa

Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull

Pull another one out uhhh



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me

There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me

But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my

It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me

So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?

Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep

And I creep right through the front seat

So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep

Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?

He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me

He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny

She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak

Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy

Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties

I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty

Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

But I'd tried to stay wide awake

Cause you might be found dead by the lake

Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take

Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?

I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?

Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets

How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya

Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there

I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya

Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya

Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower

Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars

Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da

Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta

Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya

Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water

Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand

Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe

Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that

What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Good evening!
This is your fuckin' captain speaking!
We will soon be reaching an altitude of... 4 million and a half feet

That's 8 million miles in the sky!

Undo your seat belt for take off

You are now free to smoke about the cabin.

Tik-it!

[Dr. Dre:] I'm Dre from - back in the day from

N.W.A from - back in the grave from

Chokin' a bitch to - smacking her face from

Stacking up bodies to - blacken they case up from.

Racking up hits to - stacking them crates up.

I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm!

And we was happening and rap entertainment,

Me and shady for us competition, faggot there ain't none! (EM: yeah!)

[Eminem:] Speak of the devil, it's the attack of the rain man,

Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron.

Soon as the blades spun vrun they run away from,

Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from!

In search of a brain surgeon the great one,

Wait it ain't funny man it's urgent I need one.

Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun,

And a emergency squirtgun to spray everyone.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So one more time for old time's sake! [scratches]

Dre drop that beat! - And scratch that break!

Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go! (Tik-it! We're now smoking with the best, the best! Tik-it!)



I said one more time for old time's sake [scratches]

Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go! (Tik-it! we're now smoking with the best, the best! Tik-it!)



[Verse 2:]

[Eminem:] Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless

A nice environment!

Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants

Taking lives of firemen

Say goodbye, here I am again. - Naked wives and Vicodin,

Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy I could spin.

Vin-vin! - Fuck the handle! I fly off the hinge!

Let the boy off the bench coach and throw it to him.

There he goes in his trench coat and them clothes again,

Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin.

I'll show you every inch girls of my foreskin,

Show me nipple, I pinch both and throw up a ten.

Now you know it's a sin to tease blow us again

The sorcerer of intercourse if it's forced it's him.

""Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within

When you wake in the morning next to the porcelain! ""



[Chorus]

[Dr. Dre:] Now where there's smoke there's fire - where there's fire there's flames

Where there's flames there's chronic - either you high or you ain't.

I got no time for no games. (Eminem: Nah-ah he ain't playing!)

[Eminem:] He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your bra-in

I'm slightly insa-ne! - Vodka and Creatine

Hypnotic and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink.

And it's giving me wings! - I believe I can fly.

While I pee on the girl you won't catch me CSI!

It's as easy as pie! - And as simple as cake.

Dre get on the mic [scratches] and make them tremble and shake!

[Dr. Dre:] Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your hand and your coke

And if you really want to get fucked up! - Just let me know!

We can smoke if there is no more lighter fluid to do it,

Let's get into it! - You smoking with the triedest and truest.

I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up

You muthafuckers ain't smoking, you just holding shit up!

Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt

I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one.

Cause if at first you don't succeed. - Won't hurt to smoke some weed.

Now them words are just a little more personal for me

Seeing as how - I blew up off puffing them trees

[Eminem {Dre}:] Was luck enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up cheech!

Come on smoke me up cause, get me contact buzz!

Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff!

""But this is Earth calling Shady, man come on back! "" (whaaaat?)

""Man we're losing him! He won't even respond back fuck!

Now look at all the pretty women in here. {Damn bitches! }

I feel like dancing
I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me (high)

I said I smell something in the air that's making me high



Ok here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, I'm so la-di-da so

Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco

You mother fuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs

Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos

Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole

She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto

Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso

Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so

You know how that go, skull and the crossbones

This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know

You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice)

This is niether the time or the place to get macho

So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos

Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow

It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though

Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the drill

Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill

You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel

Like I don't think anyone's real,

Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer

Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,

Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama

Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,

Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza

How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,

Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,

Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,

Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,

The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate

And which motel which lake they found her in,

And how they attacked the victim,

Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,

Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,

So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like

Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light

Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way

Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?

Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms

Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,

He can give her some, she can give him some

Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome

You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm

Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up

Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a

Titanium brain that's full of, surprises

When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes

You stare into your stereos eyes

Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,

I didn't even smoke anything, I didn't even drink anything



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind"

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then I salivate
Start off with the nyquil like I think I'll just have a taste

Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate

Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great

I go to take just one and I end up like having eight

Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate

Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak

And you'd think with all I have at stake

Look at my daughters face...

Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think

He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me

Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me

And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos

And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

Soon as I go home and close the door,

Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

And why I just don't know...



[Verse 2:]

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer

That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year

And that fucker still talks to me he is all I can fuckin hear

Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers

And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half as buzzed for half of the time

Who's the mastermind behind that little line

With that kind of rational mind I got half a mind

To have another half a glass of wine sound asinine

Ya I know

But I never had no problem with alcohol

Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall

I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball

Shit must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all

Wow what the fuck happend last night where am I

Man fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache

Shit half a vicodin why can't I?

"" All systems ready for take off please stand by ""



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

Soon as I go home and close the door,

Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

And why I just don't know...



[Verse 3:]

So I take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh

A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high

Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by

Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die

Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use

There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through

It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze

What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes

Now here I am 3 months later full blown relapse

Just get high untill the kids get home from school homes relax

And since I'm convinced that I'm an in-somniac

I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps

Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see

That's an ambien each nap how many valium 3

And that will average out to about one good hour sleep

Ok so now you see the reason how come he

Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b

See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath

Cause that christmas you know the pneumonia thing

It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think

Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos

Your vcr tape cases with your ambien cr great places to hide ain't it

So you can lie to hailie I'm going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina

Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance

They said they found me on the bathroom floor



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



I'm just so fuckin depressed, 

I just can't seem to get out this slump

If I could just get over this hump, 

but I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps, 

fell down and I got right back up

But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 

in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when I ended up 

in this position I'm in

I'm startin to feel distant again, 

so I decided just to pick this pen



Up and try to make an attempt to vent 

but I just can't admit or come to grips

With the fact that I may be done with rap, 

I need a new outlet

And I know some shit so hard to swallow, 

but I just can't sit back and wallow

In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, 

I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow

I'll be one tough act to follow

Here today, gone tomorrow, 

but you'd have to walk a thousand miles...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



But don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



So don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, 

everythings so tense and gloom, I

Almost feel like I got to check the temperture 

of the room just as soon as

I walk in, it's like all eyes on me, 

so I try to avoid any eye contact

Cause if I do that, then it opens the door 

for coversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention, 

I just want to be just like you



Blend in with the rest of the room, 

maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fuckin man servant, 

tryna follow me around and wipe my ass

And laugh at every single joke 

I crack and half of them ain't even funny like

""Ahh, Marshall you're so funny man 

you should be a comedian, god damn""

Unfortunately I am, I just hide 

behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down, 

listen to the tale I'm about to tell

Hell, we ain't gotta trade our shoes, 

and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Nobody asked for life to deal us 

what these bullshit hands were dealt

We gotta take these cards ourselves, 

and flip them, don't expect no help

Now I could of either just sat on my ass 

and pissed and moaned

Or take this situation in which I'm placed, 

and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door 

and pack his bags

Or sat on the porch and hoped and pray 

for a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, 

every school I went

I dreamed of being that cool kid, 

even if it meant actin stupid



And Aunt Edna was told me, 

keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that

Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue 

tryna talk like ""thissss""

Till I stuck my tongue on that 

frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old

I learned my lesson then,

cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, 

not just based on my description

Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin, 

it's probably 110 percent different

I guess we would have to walk a mile 

in each others shoes at least

What size you wear? I wear 10's, 

let's see if you could fit your feet...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Lately I've been hard to reach

I've been too long on my own

Everybody has their private world

Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?

Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. 

Dad will be home soon. 

And to the rest of the world, 

God gave you them shoes, to fit you, 

so put them on and wear em. Be yourself man. 

Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny, 

don't ever let anyone tell you, you ain't beautiful."

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for...
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,

The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:

Slim Shady!



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn

And we're starting this party from dusk



Ok... let's go



[Eminem:]

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk

Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust

Just one up my mothers son who got thrown under the bus

Kiss my butt. Lick from under cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks

It's a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.

Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.

Fist the cut. The lady give her eighty some paper cut.

Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought

Cause when I spit the verse the shit

Gets worse and worse cause your soft

If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time

Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.

I venture to say with the center of attention it's true

Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal

Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model.

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre



[Dr Dre:]

They see that low rider go by there, like Oh my!

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why.

I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.

I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.

Cause over and above all, it's just another day

And this one begins where the last one ends.

Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.

I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.

Driving around with a smashed front end

Let's cash that one in.

Grab another one from out the stable

The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado

The hell if I know.

Do I want leather seats or vinyl?

Decisions, decision

Garage looks like precision collision.

Or maico beats quake like Waco

Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model .

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent



[50 Cent:]

It's bottle after bottle

The money ain't a thang when you party with me

It's what we into it's simple

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe

I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm king kong

Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on

I'm so calm through vietnam ring the alarm

Bring the shaun dawn burn marajaun do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what

Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck

I spend it like it don't mean nothing

Blow it like it's suposed to be blown

Motherfucker I'm grown

I stunt I style I flash the shit

I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick

Fat ass burgandy bags classy shit jimmy cho shoes

I say move a bitch move

Dre, I'm down here

Under the ground, dig me up

Broken tibias, fibulas, yeah fix me up

60 sluts

All of em

Dying from asphyxia

After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeve sippy cup



Dixie cups, toxic, boxes of oxi pads

Enough oxi cotton to send a fucking ox to rehab

Whack job

In the back

In a black stocking cap

Jacking off to a hockey mask

At a boxing match



(He can't say that)



Yes he can

I just did faggot

Now guess again

Better text message her 

next to Ken(?)

Tell him shit's about to get extra messy

Especially when I 

Flex again

Throw a fucking lesbian in wet cement

Faggoty faggoty faggoty raggedy

No

No it can't be it can't be

Yes it can be

It's Satan in black satin panties



This is Amityville

Calamity

Goddammit

Insanity

Pills

Fanny pack

Filled

With Zanies

Through every nook-n-cranny

Looking for trannies

Milk 'n' cookies

Spilled

On my silk, necklace, jade



Look



Razor b-lades with me

To make you b-leed

Cases of Maybelline

Make-up

Lay on a table

Of weed

Slim Shady

Shit sounds like a fable to me

'till he jumps out the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

Six semen samples

Seventeen strands of hair

Found in the back of a van

After the shoot at Vanity Fair

Hannah Montana

Prepare to elope with a can opener

And feet cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds



And Glad bags, yeah 

glad to be back

'Cause last year was a tragedy

That landed me smack dab in rehab

Fuckin' doctor

I ain't understand a damn what he said

I planned a relapse the second I walked out of that bitch



Two weeks in Brighton

I ain't enlightened

Bitin' into a fuckin' biket and

light them a (?)

Oh

Might be a fucking sign

And I need a psychic

Evaluation

Fuck Jason

That means it's just a regular day

And this is the kind of shit I think of regu-lar-ly

Shouldn't have had her legs in the way

Missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

[Verse 3]



Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming

To spit it back in abundance

Hit a fag with onions

And split a bag of Funyuns

Mad at me

Understandable

Cannibal

Shoot an animal

Out of a cannon

And have 'em catapult...

At an adult



Captain of a cult

With an elite following

To turn Halloween back

To a trick-or-treat holiday

Had Michael Myers lookin' like a liar

Swipe his powers

Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers



Hit Jason Voorhees with a forty

Stuck a suppository up his ass

And made him tell me a story



Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine

And sat him in a fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture



Walked up Elm street with a fucking (?)

Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too

And came out with a little scratch, ooh

Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple FAT Goose



Insanity

Can't it be

Vanity

Where's the humanity

In having a twisted fantasy

With an arm and leg amputee



Straitjacket 

Wit' a hundred and 8 brackets

And a strap that wraps twice around my back

Then they latch it

Cut your fuckin' head off and ask where you headed off to



Get it?

Headed off to?



Medic, this headache's awful

This anaesthetic's pathetic

So is this diabetic waffle

And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco!

Here comes the rain!

And thunder now!

No where to run!

To run to now!

I've disappeared!

Don't wonder how!

Looking for me!

It may not mean nothing to ya'll
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

I'm shutting shit down at the mall

And telling every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even planning to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man



[Verse 1: Drake]

Last name ever, first name greatest

Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with

It started off local but thanks to all the haters

I know G4 pilots on a first name basis

And your city faded off to brown, nino

She insists she got more class, we know

Swimming in the money come and find me, nemo

If I was at the club you know I ball, kimo

Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album

Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome

Labels want my name beside the X like malcom

Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah, nigga I'm about my business

Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list

Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness

If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness

Bitches

It may not mean nothing to ya'll

But understand nothing was done for me

So I don't plan on stopping at all

And I ain't even planning to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man



[Verse 2: Kanye West]

I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains

I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came

I went hard all fall like the ball teams

Just so I can make it rain all spring

Ya'll seen my story my glory

I had raped the game young you can call it statutory

When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues for me

Old money benjamin button, what nothin'

Now superbad chicks giving me MacLovin'

You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband

You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't

Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't

You're such a fucking loser

He didn't even go to class mueller

Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back

Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack

Chasing the stardom would turn you to a maniac

All the way in hollywood and I can't even act

They pull their cameras out and god damn they snap

I used to want this thing forever ya'll can have it back



[Chorus:]

It may not mean nothing to ya'll

But understand nothing was done for me

So I don't plan on stopping at all

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

I'm shutting shit down at the mall

And telling every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even planning to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man



[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]

Okay, hello it's the martian, space jam jordans

I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the Garden

Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target

If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans

And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops

Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top

Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops

But what should I scream for this is my theme park

My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark

Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk

Let the king talk check the price and pay attention

Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention

I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer

I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover

Shhhh, my foots sleeping on the gas

No brake pads no such thing as last



[Chorus:]

It may not mean nothing to ya'll

But understand nothing was done for me

So I don't plan on stopping at all

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

I'm shutting shit down at the mall

And telling every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even planning to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man



[Verse 4: Eminem]

There they go, back in stadiums as shady spits his flow

Nuts they go, macademia they go so ballistic whoa

He can make them look like posers, he's wondering if he should spit this slow

Fuck no go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no

He ain't had of a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed

They've been waiting patiently for pinnochio to poke his nose

Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as before

Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing a name as he goes

The passion of the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it

This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot

You dealin' with a few true villians, whose stayin' inside of the booth truth spillin'

And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths now rewind it

Payback motherfucker for the way that you doubted me hows it taste

When I slap the taste out of your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place

I'm hannibal lecters so just incase your thinking of saving face

You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place so drake



[Chorus:]

It may not mean nothing to ya'll

But understand nothing was done for me

So I don't plan on stopping at all

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

I'm shutting shit down at the mall

And telling every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even planning to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man"

[Eminem - Verse 1:]
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want them fans jumping
I want them fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire

But I feel like a million bucks, Ladies won't you fill your cups?

Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup

You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E

You'll be in the E-R, we are strapped with so much T-N-T

We may blow, no, not even C-P-R from the EMT

Can help you to resuscitate, You bustas must be flustered, wait

You can't cut the mustard, What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?

(chk chk) What's my name? Shady came to crush the game

Instantly, not even fair to them cause they pale in comparisons

So much they might as well wear a skin, don't you wish you could just share his pen?

Cause this shit is getting embarrassing, the fog is thick and the air is thin

Cause he won't even let them try to breathe, Dadidadidadadi

He makes it look so easy, Girl you just hit the lottery



[Eminem - Chorus:]

Now this would be the part of the song

Where they drop the meter and hell breaks loose

Try to restrain us, you can't contain us

We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do

Everywhere we go, it seems we looking

For any excuse to just cut loose



So this would be the part of the song

Where they drop the meter and hell breaks loose



[Dr. Dre (Eminem) - Verse 2:]

This is when shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand

This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers

Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front

So do what we say and once it's over like a suance, it hums

(It makes them stay in a trance, No choice, they have to dance)

It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt

Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts

You must be smokin' something, think I ain't smokin' nothing, stay off my nuts



Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust

Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose

Yeah, girl, shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse

D-R-E is on the loose, I'm like a goose when it comes to the Chronic use

You know I can't stand to lose, Me and my goons are like animals

Wake up like a pack of wolves and we came here to extract the roof

Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your mans is like in the booth

Definitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose



[Chorus]

Now this would be the part of the song

Where they drop the meter and hell breaks loose

Try to restrain us, you can't contain us

We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do

Everywhere we go, it seems we looking

For any excuse to just cut loose



So this would be the part of the song

Where they drop the meter and hell breaks loose



[Eminem (Dr. Dre) - Verse 3:]

Now I know your feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words

I'm murdering the flow, Liquid courage I'm fitting to blow

As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe

I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go

We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows

Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block with your hoe

With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc

Can proceed to drop me and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

(Yeah, So let us in before we huff and puff and we blow

We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out your

Revenge is so sweet, move until you injure your feet

Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat

Lose yourself indubitably

Pass on that little cute chick right over there,

That'd be pretty damn stupid to me

Born and raised in the CPT, yeah, I'm saying ? in the streets

Them haters hating on me but I refuse to lose any sleep

Keep that deuce deuce in the seat, Dre fall off? That's news to me)"

Better watch out, sucka now I gotcha where I want ya
Onslaught, comin and I'm packin in my lunch up

Bunch of, missile launchers and a bunch of contra-

-band, van full of ganja, now come on jump

Man stop, mashin Marshall on my gotcha

Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quadra-

-plegic, boogeyin down to Frank Sinatra

Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya

Who'da knew the buddah do to me what it's done

Such cynicism when this isn't in my system

Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips son

So much on my hands I got to give my kids a fist bump

Christo-pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks

""Mister, help me"" 's what he said to me and then sunk

Women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks

In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin once



[Chorus: Eminem]

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill

Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts

Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts

Man you don't want to go up in those hills

Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills

You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill

Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill



[Eminem]

Always, you can see him lurkin in the hallways

Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space

How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place

Hide 'em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?

Well fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait

Until it dries for the moment I guess you're all safe

After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint

My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't

Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin

You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within

Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummagin

It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want to skin

Been, on the hunt again; when, will it ever end?

Evelyn, why you tryin to fight? You will never win

Severin, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb

Pull the lever then, trapdoor, death is evident



[Chorus]



[Eminem]

Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin so chill

Fuckin whore you better fuckin hold still

Make sure none of that, lotion in the bucket don't spill

Cut 'em, gut 'em and just keep to stuffin those girls

Man I think she had enough of those pills

Sedate her then I'll wait, I'll come back later just to clutch on those steel

Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal

I hate the loud noises, I fuckin told you!

I keep hearin voices like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife

And push it right through her while you put ya shish-kabob skewers

Into her, barbecue her or would you do to her

What you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?

[as Yoda] ""In a world of sin you are, this is turnin into a

Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are!""

I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya

Boo-yah, who ya think you're fuckin with; duck because here he comes again

[Chorus: Eminem]

There once was a saying that, 

I used to say

Back in the day when, I met Dre

I used to sit and goof on the phone with, 

my friend Proof

That if I went gold, 

I'd go right through the roof

He'd say ""What if you went platinum?""

I'll just laugh at him

That's, not happenin, 

that I can't fathom

Eighty-somethin million records worldwide later

I'm living, in a house 

with a fuckin elevator



[Verse 1: Eminem]

Haters gettin mad, they done had enough of Shady

You slay me, nothin you say matters enough to (add) touche me

Rappers try to play me, they use hailie as a Ukelele

Whoops-e-dada fuckin' daisy, that's a no-no, even She knows that I's fucking crazy

Fuckin' animal, cookoo for bananas, fuckin' A B

Maybe its because I never had a mother raise me,

Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby

You may think it's cuz' the way that I was Brought up, but it's all caught up to me now, Karma's in the waters

Every line I ever said has got me in a corner, You might think it doesn't creep up on ya but it All does

You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when Ya started

Now ya brain's all horny, cuz of all the shit ya Thought of

Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into Sawdust

I never thought it would come to this, I outta just be honest, but

Someone shut that fuckin' baby up 'fore i shake it

Your standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, They're facing

Together makes 'em, a fuckin' bad combination

I lashed at the doctor in my last operation,

Shoved the wiener schnitzel up his ass, hopped Away some-

Body please stop the patient, get the cops to Mace him

Homie im the shizer, pass Dr Dre some

I cant leave the game, I just can't walk away son

No, not-a now, not a chance, not today son

I can't believe I leave for one brief second, 

And you pussies quief all over the rap game, naked

And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it

I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I

Told the neighbor step away, then i just pepper-sprayed 'em

Or hide out, drive by, my house and beep

Like now, motherfucker, try now to sleep

Lie down, fucker, bah, try countin' sheep

And ya tryin' to find out why now theres beef,

Mace in ya face bitch, cry now pussy

This is my house, all nine thousand feet,

So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth

Then i shove 'em in the elevator,

Take 'em to the top,

Stand above 'em, just to cut the fuckin' cable, Let 'em drop

Walk an hour to the damn refridgerator, get a pop

While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, Yellin' stop

Rainman!
Make my... vocal sound... sexy!
Woo!
Come on man!
Come on man!

Okaaaay!



[Chorus:]

It feels so wrong, does it feel so right?

But it's alright! - It's okay with me!

I'll do my steps all by myself,

I don't need no-body to play with me;

But if you just give me a chance,

I can put you in a trance the way I dance!

But don't nobody wanna play with me so,

I'm taking my ball and going home! - Hooome!



[Verse 1:]

I'm that guy man! - Shove a diamond up my hind end,

And crush it with my butt-muscles while I cut vocals.

Slut, poke holes in your shirt jump in mud puddles,

While I stomp mudholes in your ass girl, now let's cuddle!

Blood curdlin', you're gurglin' on your blood, what'll

I do for my next trick? - I'm feeling wonder-ful!

I think I might just do something a little less subtle,

Shove a fucking Tonka truck up a little kids butthole! (Ooooh!)

Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash Ambassador,

Of the ""Valentine's Day Massacre""!

Slash assassin, I slash her in ass with a'

Icicle and leave her in a blood bath while I,

Put a catheter in - and jump in the bath with her,

In my Spider-Man mask just imagine

The fun I can have with a strap on!

Stick it up a Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon! (hahaa!)

Are those pistachios? Damn, I'd like to have some,

Layin' on the patio, man rolling a fat one!

Shady drop the magic marker put the cap on,

Goddamn man! Are you that much of an asshole? (ooookay!)



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]

I'm like Houdini! - Tuck my teeny, eenie-weenie between each

One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie!

Make this shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini, (oooh-hooo!)

Believe me homie! you don't know the meaning of a meanie!

They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter,

I'm tryna maneuver the Hoover up in your poop shoot, don't move, or ya

Might get it stuck so fuckin' far up in your uvula,

You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to your gluteus! (whooo, whooo!)

Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio,

Now who do ya think is more fruitier?

Weenier's smothered in peanut butter, pudding on the ""tube"" of ""your,

Eye shadow and man it looked nice! - You shoulda seen it mother!

I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card,

Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart!

And mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's,

With McDonald's! - Jump in her lap and watch ""The Sopranos""! (ooookay!)



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

""Shady what are ya doin'? Chewin' on a human? ""

Grab an aluminum bat, hit Heidi Klum in the back, boom!

And assumin' the fact that, that dude's in the back room,

Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon!

Skewin' a rat, a cat screwin' a baboon!

You shouldn't ask: ""What is he doin' with that broom? ""

You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds,

You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh!

But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair and

Make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'! (ha-ha!)

Shady what do you gotta pick on the lady for?

Why you make her read eighty-four bed time stories to you in baby talk?

""Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed!

Kelly Pickler hid my juicebox under my bassinet!

No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed,

Do you like graffiti, dyke? Well, I can pee-pee and write your name! "" (ooookay!)



[Chorus]



[Outro:]

Fine!

Nobody wants to play with me?

Fuck you then... bitch!

Guys are always mean to me anyways!

All you ever do is rub gum in my hair... stuff!

You guys are going to make me... make sad!

I'm sad!

I'm gonna cry!

I'm crying!

Huhh-huhhh!

Yeah, girl
Can you hear that?
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?



You hear the beat as it makes you not want to go to sleep

I knock on Dakota's door, it's locked, so I go to creep

'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep

But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat

Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet

With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall, he's on your street

He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet

Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek

Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham

Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam

Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'

I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am



(My music box) 'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep

(My music box) But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me

(My music box) Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me

(My music box) So once you call, I come, I will answer

(My music box, my music box)

'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl’s asleep

(My music box) I hear my music box playing a song for me

(My music box) So won’t you twirl around and do a whirl for me?

(My music box, my music box) And would you be my private little dancer?



I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober? Gross

I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose

Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose

My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know

I put on my mother's makeup, get naked, and run around

Waving the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds

There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?

The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out

I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?

Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house

They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box

Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked

I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts

I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts

It's playing a song so beautiful, and the room is dark

The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep

And would you be my private little dancer?



I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin' this little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick

The sick, Satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings

I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'

Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'

The mortician of love, sent from above

Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become

Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb

Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns

The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder

I've had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her

Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her

With a bat—a matter of fact, that will splatter her

But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her

Give her two compliments back to back like, ""Tabitha

I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya

So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula""

Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her

Dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her

Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera

Stand back, 'cause here comes your man, Jack, so Pamela



(My music box)

'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep

(My music box)

But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me

Oh my god boy, you didn't go there, no you did not,

I got a whole story board for you, boy your da plot,

Your gettin got whether you try to avoid it or not,

Apology not accepted boy, Detroit is a rock,

We get to beefing, aint no telling at what point it will stop,

All I got to do is point to the spot,

When the bomb drops boy does it drop,

And when it does boy there's a problem,



[Chorus]



[Verse 3]

Boy dont jinx yourself,

Boy I'm Michael Spinks with the belt,

String a bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,

I'm sick as hell boy,

You better run and tell someone else,

Bringin hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt

And to that boy who done said it :,

Who said he was better,

I bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,

Back better than ever,

The chedder shredder the grater the beef grinder

I'll settle vendettas a little later,

Giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,

By saying shady was ghost I aint even close the gate (?)

You bout to be put in a grave, stay put and behave,

Im bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day

So hey wouldn't you say I'm the shit,

Couldn't agree with ya more fuel to say to my fucking shit doesn't stink,

Shady fucking aftermath boy the shit doesnt sink it just floats int he fucking water

Til we fill up the tank,

If I woulda rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say something about Paul Wall, you'd probably crap in your

Pants, cause I'm white, and he's white, so he's like

My competition I mean, right?

Nope, Paul Wall is dope

And so's Bubba, so BLALALALAPFFTTTTT

B-b-b-b-b-but, I don't compete with nobody

I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali

Shuffle, and dance around my opponents, you don't

Sometime's I just play possom, Like I'm asleep that's awesome

I'm like a sleeping Giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre

I just jump from outta nowhere and bite Prey

Sink my teeth in him and fill him, full of poison

And make a noise like snake before I kill him

And let him know that I just don't feel him

And smack him with the backward E, the Eminem emblem

Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em

Tell em why, look them dead in the eye, then waste em

And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell

And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell

And the shadows of all who are willing to sell

Their souls, for this rap game, and it g-g-goes

123, 123, 123, that ain't the hook, now follow me

There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me

Everybody bores me, they're just so corny

So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror

The mirror grows lips and it whispers ""Come nearer""



[Chorus]

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



[Verse 2]

""Shady, I know you're in there, so where? Come here

Talk to me, sit here, pull up a chair

Why don't you gotcha hair? Hahahahaha

Dye it back, come on, try it"" AHHHHHHHHH

No, I told you, leave me the fuck alone will you?

""But I'm here to rebuild you"", But I already killed you!

""But Shady, we were meant for eachother

Think about your mother"", yeah so what of her?

""Well think about what she did to you and your little brother

All them foster homes..."", fuck you motherfucker!

I had you beat ""No I was playin' possom, remember?

I let you watch your little girls blossom

I gave you enough time, your souls mine

I'm taking it back"", you fuck bitch WHY!

""Because I love you, look a little closer

Isn't that us on that poster? haha""



[Chorus]

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



[Verse 3]

""Shady, listen... ""SHADY!"", you hear that?

They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back""

But I don't want it back! ""Yes you do...""

No I don't! ""Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!""

No I won't! ""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the doctor""

Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday

""Well I got him on the phone right now!""

You're lying, ""yo slim"", HOW, WHY NOW!

Whatup Dre? ""Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya

I don't know, it just seems every since you got off ya

Drugs, you became a lot softer""

But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka

""Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here

Just hit me back, and let me know what's up""

Fuck this mirror! AHHHHHHH

""I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you""

Fuck you, die you son of a bitch

""Put the gun down"", BYE BYE!

Ok I'm still alive, ""So am I too!

You can kill a spirit, even if you tried to

Haha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?

You remember that night you, prayed to god

You'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you

This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right through

Look at this house, look at these cars, I'm so nice, wooo!

Oh, but you didn't know, fame has a price too

That you're just now seeing the downside to

Lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too

Ain't even sure if your kids like you

Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without Nyquill

Become a valium addict, start a rehab cycle

But together we can break the cycle

Marshall..."" WHAT! ""no one's gonna love you like I do!""

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I said, I don't ever want you to leave me

So this is it...
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Feigned to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different

But something changed

The minute that I got a whiff of it

I started to inhale it

Smell it

Started sniffin' it

And it became my cocaine

I just couldn't quit

I just wanted a little bit

Then it turned me (in) to a monster

I became a hypocrite

Concert after concert



I was raking in the dough

Rolling in green

Had the game hemmed up

Like a sewing machine

But I was losing my freedom

There was no where for me

To not go and be seen

And just go and be me

And there was no in-between

You either loved it or hate it



Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3

Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it

And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest

The Marshall Mathers was a classic

The Eminem Show was fantastic

But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it

I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet

A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic

And eight years later, I'm still at it

Divorce, re-married

A felon

A father

Sleeping pill addict

And this is real talk

I feel like the Incredible Hulk

My back has been broke, and I can still walk



[Chorus]

So be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold



I said



Be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold



[Verse 2]

I got a letter from a fan, that said

He's been praying for me

Every day and for some reason

It's been weighing on my mind heavy

'Cause I don't read every

Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but

Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?

You didn't pray for me when I was local

And as I lay these vocals

I think of all the shit I had to go through

Just to get to where I'm at

I've already told you at least



A thousand times in these rhymes

I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got

God on my side

And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?

Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint

Man, boy's got to look

Nuts

And that's the only word I can think of right now

On how

To describe the shit

This is like a vibe you get

Go ahead and bob to it

Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit



[Chorus]

So be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold



I said



Be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold"

You're walkin down a horror corridor

It's almost 4 in the mornin

And your in a

Nightmare

It's HORRIBLE

Right there's the coroner

Waitin for you

To turn the corner

So he can corner ya

Your a goner

He's ona ya

Out the corner of his cornea

He just saw you run

All you want is to rest

Cause you can't run anymore

Your done

All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience

While everybody

Is watchin in the party applauding it

Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again

Contemplading my next plot again

Swallowin the Klonopin

While I'm noddin

In and out on the autumn and

If the ramada inn

Holdin onto the pill bottle then

Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom

And make sure I got all of it

Wake up naked at mcdonalds

With

Blood all over me

Dead bodies

Behind the counter

SHIT

Guess I must of just blacked out again

NOT AGAIN



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



(Verse 2)

Sitting nude in my living room

It's almost noon

I wonder what's on the tube

Maybe they'll show some boobs

Surfing every channel

Until I find hannah montana

Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin

Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin

Every candle on top of the fire place

Mantalin

Grab my flannel and my bandana then

Kiss the naked manakin man again

You can see him standin in my

Front window

If you look in

I'm just a hooligan

Who's use to usin hallicinogens

Causin illusions again

Brain contusions again

Cutting and bruising the skin

Raise the scissors and pins

Jesus when does it end

Phases that I go through

Dazed and I'm so confused

Days that I don't know who

Gave these molecules too

Me

What am I gone do

Had the prodical son

The diabolical one

Very methodical

I slaughtered them



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again



I duck and I slash slice and gash

Last night was a blast

I can't quite remember when I

Had that much fun

Off a half pint of the jack

My last vic and a half

A flashlight

Up kim kardashians ass



I remember the first time

I dismembered a family member

December I think it was

I was having drinks with my cuz

And I wrapped him

In christmas lights

Pushed him into the stinkin tub

Cut him up into pieces

Then just when I went to drink his

Blood

I thought I outta drink this bath water

That outta be fun

That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun

The sight of blood excites me

That might be an artery son

Your blood curdling screams

Just don't seem to bother me none

It's 3 am

And here I come

So you should probably run

A secret passage way around here

Man there's got to be one

Oh no there's probably none

He can scream all that he wants

Top of his lungs

It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)



(Chorus)

Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo Yo

Alright, I'm a lay the chorus first



Here we gooo now



[Chorus:]

My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am because I'm like her



Because My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Verse 1:]

My mom, my mom,

I know your probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom, Oooh whooa

But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty

And how I become hooked on vah-a-l-ium

Valium was in everything, food that I ate

The water that I drank, fuckin peas in my plate

She sprinkled just enough of it just to season my steak

So everyday I'd have at least three stomach aches

Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her

Son to grow up to be an under-afuckin-chiever

My teacher didn't think I was gunna be nothin either

""What the fuck you stickin gum up under the fuckin seat for? ""

""Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffin ether, ""

""Either that or the motherfuckers been puffin' reefer""

But all this huffin and puffin wasn't what it was either, it was neither

I was buzzin but it wasn't what she thought

Pee in teacup? Bitch you ain't my keeper I'm sleepin

What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for

Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin

Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!



[Chorus:]

My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am cause I'm like her



Because My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Verse 2:]

Wait a minute... This ain't dinner, this is paint thinner

""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints did I?

Now heres a plate full of pain killers, now just wait till I crush the valium

And put it in your potatoes, you little motherfucker,

I'll make you sit there and make that retarded fuckin face Without even tastin it.

You better lick that fuckin' plate you ain't wastin' it, put your face in it

'Fore I throw you in the basement again, and I ain't givin' in

Your gunna just sit there in one fuckin place spi?

Till next Thanksgiving and if you still ain't finished

Then I'll use the same shit again, then When I make spinach dip

It'll be placed in the shit.

You little shit Wanna sit there and play innocent

A rack filler hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it

Child support? Your father he ain't sent the shit

And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business kid""



[Bridge 1:]

My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom

I know I should let bygones be bygones

But shes the reason why I am high what I'm high on



[Chorus:]

My mom loves valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am cause I'm like her



Because My mom loves valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Bridge 2:]

My mom loves valium now while I am

There's a party animal, I am what I am

But I'm strong to the finish with me valium spinach

But my buzz only last about two minutes

But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it

I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it

My valium, My valiiiuuuuum



[Verse 3:]

Man I never thought I could never be a drug addict

Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me

But that actually what has ended up happenin'

A tradegy, of fuckin passin it up, catchin' me

And it's probably where I got aquanted with the taste, Ain't it

Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom, beautiful

She killed a fuckin dog with the medicine she done fed it

Feed a fuckin asprin and say that it has a headache

""Here want a snack, you hungry you fuckin brat? ""

""Look at that, it's a xanax, take it and take a nap! EAT IT! ""

But I DONT NEED IT!

""WELL FUCK IT, then break it up! ""

""Take a little piece then beat it, before you wake Nathan up! ""

Alright ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'

I'll do it, pop it gobble it, and start wobblin'

Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, tripped and I fall in bed

With a bottle of Meds, and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed

""Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead? ""

After I fuck you in the butt, get some head

Bust a nut, get some rest

The next day my mother said, ""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid""

The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared

He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead

Terry don't let that fucker get you upset

Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck

I bet you he's faking it

I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get

I'll go handle this of course unless you object

Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head



[Chorus:]

If you could count the skeletons in my closet

Under my bed and up under my faucet

Then you would know I've completely lost it

Is he nuts? No, he's insane



If you could count the skeletons in my closet

Under my bed and up under my faucet

Then you would know I've completely lost it

Is he nuts? No, he's insane



[Verse 2:]

You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off

I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw

Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off

Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot

Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop

Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong

Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong

That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong

Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn

And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on

Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off

Everything except his tank top and his training bra

Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog

Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?

Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?

Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)

Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?

Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching

Burp belch and go back for a second helping

Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?

I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me

Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping

Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!

What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!

Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being

No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing

I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see

I only get naked when the babysitter tells me

She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street

But actually it was called The Pubic Hair on Chelsie

Well this is called Ass-Rape and we should do the Jail scene

Ok, let me see
How could I begin

Locked in mariahs wine cellar all I had for lunch,

Was red wine more red wine and some captain crunch,

Red wine for breakfast and for brunch,

And to soak it up and in between snack, crack ers to munch

Mariah what ever happened to us

Why did we have to break up

All I asked for was a glass of punch

Ya see I never really asked for much

I can't imagine what's

Going through your mind after such

A nasty break up with that latin hunk

Luis migul

Nick cannon better back the fuck up

I'm not playin I want her back ya punk

This is hello kitty bed spread satin funk

Mixed with egyptian with a little rap and punk

Zapp and eric clapton

Shaft, prince, abba, crunk

Ya baby

I want another crack at ya

You can beat me with any spatula that you want

man I really want you bad you cunt

Nick you had your fun

I've come to kick you in your sack of junk

Man I could use a fresh batch of blood

So prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from baghdad

When will it ever cease

For pete sakes he crazy to say the least

Bagpipes from baghdad

What's going through my mind

Half time when I rhyme

While blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

Somebody turn the vacancy sign on

Cause I'm gone

Blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

I run the streets and act like a mad man holding a glad...



[Verse 2:]

You could be a permanent fixture

In my lyrical mixture

I'm the miracle whip trickster

My signature sound

When a tube of lipsticks around

I'm bound to put it on in an instant

Wow man what an ensemble

What an assortment of pharma-

Ceuticals this beautiful pill does to my palm and

Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle

Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma

I'll cut you like dahmer

Pull a butcher knife on ya

The size of a sword boy

I'm like the fucking red sonja

Get it stuck in ya cornea

Nice knowing ya norman

Your so fucking annoying

Drop the shovel boy

You don't know what the fuck your doing

I ain't playing no fucking more

Nick cannon you prick I wish you luck with the fuckin whore

Every minute there's a sucker born

Snuck up on malachai

Made the motherfucker suck on shuck of corn

Chaka chaka khan chaka khan

Hit jason in the face with a hockey puck and

Told him it's fuckin on

Now what the fuck are you doing

Your running over the snow blower with the lawn mower blowing your bagpipes from baghdad



Bagpipes from baghdad

When will it ever cease

For pete sakes he crazy to say the least

Bagpipes from baghdad

What's going through my mind

Half time when I rhyme

While blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

Somebody turn the vacancy sign on

Cause I'm gone

Blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

I run the streets and act like a mad man holding a glad bag...



In a bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables

I bet you they'll become heterosexual

Nothing will stop me from molesting you

Titty-fucking you 'till your breast nipples flesh tickle my testicles

It's what they said to the two conjoined twins

How's it going, girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?

You need some ointment? just set up an appointment

Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip

I've just got my one year sobriety chip

When the bad get going how bad is it gonna get

Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with each other

Especially when they're joined at the hip

I'm going to get a needle thread sewing kit

In attempt to separate the [? ] back at the loin, shit [? ]

Lure the little boy with the chocolate chips Ahoy!

Cookie, lookie, even took me a polaroid

Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady

I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)



[Verse 1:]

You see that chick in the gym checking me out?

Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth

I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wrecking the house

That was suppose to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?

Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse

Man I should check to see if my mom left any out

Nope, guess I'll re-route

Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch

Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth

Down the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it

A rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn ratchet

A tat-tac-tac in the hall with the damn hatchet

A nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs

Shorty come back, I'm tryin to score me some lapdances

I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels

Formula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules

The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya



[Chorus 1:]

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

And are you menstruating baby, my lil friend's waiting to say Hello

The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin like Jello

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello



[Verse 2:]

My equilibrium is off, must be the Lithium

I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em

It just becomes everyday extracurriculum

No reason in particular, it was strictly fun

A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151

51 people asleep in my damn living room

Scuse me hun? But what is your name, Vivian?

I woke up next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?

Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy on?

I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one

No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm

But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from

I find the fact that you, I'm cool, I immediately run like Speedy Gon-

Zalez to see if I see anyone

Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some

My head is pounding to the beat of the drum



[Chorus 2:]

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow?

Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello



[Verse 3:]

Oh, those were the days, they certainly were

It's hurtin me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good

(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)

I second that and a third, rush to emergency sur-

-gery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged

He's no longer getting the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-odans

Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in

Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin him'

Childishly on the phone tryin to rustle up muscle relax-

-ers for his back and a couple of packs

Since now he's doubling back-wards and he stumblin back

Slipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack

Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap

Almost ended it that soon because of the fact

I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap

Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back



[Chorus 2]



And so I'm sayin...



[Outro:]

Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)

My name is Shaaady

So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)

It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)

My name is Shaaady

I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)

Yo...
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move! All over the globe

Same song and dance

Something about it man

Same song and dance

In the Pale Moonlight

Yo...



[Verse 1:]

I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl

Your kind of tookin' back by

The whole rapper thing aren't ya?

Probably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard ya

Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?

Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster

The police constantly buggin' ya non-stop

I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya

I think ya got your OnStar button inside your car stuck.

You outta gas, do you gotta flat?

I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat

I got your back

Why don't you put your laundry basket in the back

And sit up front, not askin' it's a trap

You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a rap

In broad day, with no mask for this attack

I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract

If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get ya back

C'mon



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



[Verse 2:]

The first victim I had, she was a big one

Big movie star, a party girl, big fun

She was the girl the media always picked on

In and out of rehab, every 4 to 6 months

She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts

And Nickelodeon flashed her little kids once

What an event it was, I was sitting in front

I was hooked in it the first glimpse of them buns

Seen her back stage now here's where I come in son

Look here she comes I better pull out the big guns

Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin hun

How bout a ride to rehab, get in cunt

Starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want

Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again hun

See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention

Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension

You little Wench ya, murder wasn't my intention

If I wanted to kill you it would of already been done

Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her

With sixty-six inches of extension... cord.



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



[Verse 3:]

My second victim was even bigger then the first

Pop star, icon, the whole works

She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst

Upon the scene and seen that the world was hers

She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts

It irked me and made me mad at first

I lashed out through my songs but what was really going on

Was that I had developed a crush

I just didn't know how to tell it to her...

Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?

Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons

Of, footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?

We'll settle this once and for all, I'm a tell her at dusk

Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must

Creep up, to her mansion in stilettos and just

Climb the gate and ring the bell like hello my love,

I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up!

Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?

I'll share my valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney!

I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one

Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent

I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you

Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value

Come-on toots, give me the valium alleyoop...

I'll slam dunk it in your mouth til you puke

And just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup

I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit out of you

New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit out of you

Shoot! Now show me how you move baby do how well ya do



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



Same kickin' and screamin' same cryin' and sobbin'

Same song and dance...

Same diggin' and pleadin' same yellin' and bleedin'

Same song and dance

Yeah

Same song and dance

I know

Same song and dance"

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)

Player!

Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)

We're the ones who made you!



Back by popular demand

Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can

You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand

How does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?

Well look at all the massive masses in the stands

Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans

Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man

She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive gluteus maximus again

Squeeze it then squash it then pass it to a friend

Can he come back as nasty as he can?

Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend

But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men

Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten

I know you want me girl, in fact I see ya grin

Now come in girl!

The enforcer, look at the more women to torture

Walk up to the cutest girl and charlie-horse her

Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres

Have that I don't? Are you tellin' me tenderness?

Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman

Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine

And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then

Nail her, ""Baby, say hello to my little friend""

Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middleman

Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again

And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge

Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention

And little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench

Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch

They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim's

I know you want me girl

'Cause I can see you're checkin' me out

And baby, you know, you know you want me too

Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you



Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa

Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?

You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album

Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but

Jessica Alba, put a breast on my mouth, bruh

Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers

And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt

Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit

I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica

Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya

Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake

Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake

With a sawblade in it to make my jailbreak

Baby, I think you just met your soulmate

Now break it down, girl!

Oh my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no! I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop it

[Verse 1:]

Welcome to the slim shady Mecca Rebeca

It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca

It's my sector homosexual dissector

Come again, rewind selector

I said nice rectum I had a visectomy Hector

So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya

Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya

I tantalize ya in and less than 5 seconds I get ya

They say once bitten and twice shy

Well I'm next to the guy with 9 extacy pills and 5 extra

Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yessir

I took the rest of the lunesta pills from my dresser

It's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?

Drop kick the bitch before her second trimester

Perform a home abortion with Dexter then I guess I

Dig the fetus out with the wire hanging and digest her



[Chorus:]

I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Let's begin, now hand me the pen

How should I begin it and where does it all end?

The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in (I said)

I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Let's begin, now hand me the pen

How should I begin it and where does it all end?

My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends



[Verse 2:]

All my westside bitches throw it up

Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up

Man I think that he just fell up the teat and shown enough

So you better change the station and keep them throwin up

Man you seen it all before, you are too familiar with it

There's a penis on floor and two balls, so you know who did it?

You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't

I won't rape all The Pussy Cat Dolls' and then call you Kitten

Now I'll pee on Rhianna, see man I do what I wanna

Spray perfume in her sauna room, Krazy Gluing Madonna

To the Lay-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her

Imagine the visual for that man, who would've thought I

Could ever be such a relentless prick

Unleashin his vengance for the chick

So old she looks like she outlived her life sentence

I never ment this rhyme to be so offensive

If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand

Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand

Here you need a hand big man? grab hold of this branch

With both hands but they don't understand I'm just a sick man

Now everybody's pissed at me

Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words geez

So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves

Won't you brake it down for me and just spit the verse please?



Eminem I'm coming to kill you (sniff)

I've always hated you and I still do

You'll never fill my shoes, my superman costume (sniff)

Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you

You're taking this shit too far (sniff)

Who do you think you are? In my suit up in the armoire

Everyday I hate you more and more, throw down the carboard

Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore

I compose art like the ghost of Mozart

Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't

Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go

(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?

Where do they go? God only knows

(Stay wide awake)



[Verse 1:]

3-5-4-4

I think I smell the scent of a placenta

I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December

I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender

Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta

Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-

-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea

Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya

I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda

Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-

-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-

-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa

Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull

Pull another one out uhhh



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me

There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me

But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my

It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me

So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?

Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep

And I creep right through the front seat

So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep

Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?

He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me

He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny

She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak

Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy

Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties

I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty

Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

But I'd tried to stay wide awake

Cause you might be found dead by the lake

Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take

Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?

I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?

Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets

How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya

Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there

I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya

Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya

Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower

Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars

Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da

Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta

Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya

Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water

Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand

Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe

Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that

What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Good evening!
This is your fuckin' captain speaking!
We will soon be reaching an altitude of... 4 million and a half feet

That's 8 million miles in the sky!

Please!

Undo your seat belt for take off

You are now free to smoke about the cabin.

Tik-it!



[Verse 1:]

[Dr. Dre:] I'm Dre from - back in the day from

N.W.A from - back in the grave from

Chokin' a bitch to - smacking her face from

Stacking up bodies to - blacken they case up from.

Racking up hits to - stacking them crates up.

I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm!

And we was happening and rap entertainment,

Me and shady for us competition, faggot there ain't none! (EM: yeah!)

[Eminem:] Speak of the devil, it's the attack of the rain man,

Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron.

Soon as the blades spun vrun they run away from,

Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from!

In search of a brain surgeon the great one,

Wait it ain't funny man it's urgent I need one.

Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun,

And a emergency squirtgun to spray everyone.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So one more time for old time's sake! [scratches]

Dre drop that beat! - And scratch that break!

Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go! (Tik-it! We're now smoking with the best, the best! Tik-it!)



I said one more time for old time's sake [scratches]

Dre drop that beat! - And scratch that break!

Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go! (Tik-it! we're now smoking with the best, the best! Tik-it!)



[Verse 2:]

[Eminem:] Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless

A nice environment!

Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants

Taking lives of firemen

Say goodbye, here I am again. - Naked wives and Vicodin,

Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy I could spin.

Vin-vin! - Fuck the handle! I fly off the hinge!

Let the boy off the bench coach and throw it to him.

There he goes in his trench coat and them clothes again,

Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin.

I'll show you every inch girls of my foreskin,

Show me nipple, I pinch both and throw up a ten.

Now you know it's a sin to tease blow us again

The sorcerer of intercourse if it's forced it's him.

""Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within

When you wake in the morning next to the porcelain! ""

[Dr. Dre:] Now where there's smoke there's fire - where there's fire there's flames

Where there's flames there's chronic - either you high or you ain't.

I got no time for no games. (Eminem: Nah-ah he ain't playing!)

[Eminem:] He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your bra-in

I'm slightly insa-ne! - Vodka and Creatine

Hypnotic and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink.

And it's giving me wings! - I believe I can fly.

While I pee on the girl you won't catch me CSI!

It's as easy as pie! - And as simple as cake.

Dre get on the mic [scratches] and make them tremble and shake!

[Dr. Dre:] Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your hand and your coke

And if you really want to get fucked up! - Just let me know!

We can smoke if there is no more lighter fluid to do it,

Let's get into it! - You smoking with the triedest and truest.

I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up

You muthafuckers ain't smoking, you just holding shit up!

Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt

I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one.

Cause if at first you don't succeed. - Won't hurt to smoke some weed.

Now them words are just a little more personal for me

Seeing as how - I blew up off puffing them trees

[Eminem {Dre}:] Was luck enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up cheech!

Come on smoke me up cause, get me contact buzz!

Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff!

""But this is Earth calling Shady, man come on back! "" (whaaaat?)

""Man we're losing him! He won't even respond back fuck!

Now look at all the pretty women in here. {Damn bitches! }

Dre it's hot I think we better go check on their temperatures.

I get the thermometer you get the bandages,

Now baby just bend over this won't hurt a damn bitness!

I feel like dancing
I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me (high)

I said I smell something in the air that's making me high



Ok here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, I'm so la-di-da so

Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco

You mother fuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs

Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos

Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole

She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto

Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso

Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so

You know how that go, skull and the crossbones

This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know

You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice)

This is niether the time or the place to get macho

So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos

Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow

It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though

Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the drill

Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill

You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel

Like I don't think anyone's real,

Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer

Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,

Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama

Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,

Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza

How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,

Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,

Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,

Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,

The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate

And which motel which lake they found her in,

And how they attacked the victim,

Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,

Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,

So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like

Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light

Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way

Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?

Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms

Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,

He can give her some, she can give him some

Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome

You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm

Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up

Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a

Titanium brain that's full of, surprises

When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes

You stare into your stereos eyes

Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,

I didn't even smoke anything, I didn't even drink anything



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind"

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then I salivate
Start off with the nyquil like I think I'll just have a taste

Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate

Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great

I go to take just one and I end up like having eight

Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate

Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak

And you'd think with all I have at stake

Look at my daughters face...

Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think

He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me

Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me

And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos

And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

Soon as I go home and close the door,

Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

And why I just don't know...



[Verse 2:]

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer

That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year

And that fucker still talks to me he is all I can fuckin hear

Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers

And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half as buzzed for half of the time

Who's the mastermind behind that little line

With that kind of rational mind I got half a mind

To have another half a glass of wine sound asinine

Ya I know

But I never had no problem with alcohol

Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall

I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball

Shit must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all

Wow what the fuck happend last night where am I

Man fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache

Shit half a vicodin why can't I?

"" All systems ready for take off please stand by ""



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

Soon as I go home and close the door,

Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

And why I just don't know...



[Verse 3:]

So I take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh

A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high

Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by

Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die

Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use

There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through

It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze

What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes

Now here I am 3 months later full blown relapse

Just get high untill the kids get home from school homes relax

And since I'm convinced that I'm an in-somniac

I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps

Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see

That's an ambien each nap how many valium 3

And that will average out to about one good hour sleep

Ok so now you see the reason how come he

Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b

See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath

Cause that christmas you know the pneumonia thing

It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think

Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos

Your vcr tape cases with your ambien cr great places to hide ain't it

So you can lie to hailie I'm going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina

Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance

They said they found me on the bathroom floor



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



I'm just so fuckin depressed, 

I just can't seem to get out this slump

If I could just get over this hump, 

but I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps, 

fell down and I got right back up

But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 

in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when I ended up 

in this position I'm in

I'm startin to feel distant again, 

so I decided just to pick this pen



Up and try to make an attempt to vent 

but I just can't admit or come to grips

With the fact that I may be done with rap, 

I need a new outlet

And I know some shit so hard to swallow, 

but I just can't sit back and wallow

In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, 

I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow

I'll be one tough act to follow

Here today, gone tomorrow, 

but you'd have to walk a thousand miles...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



But don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



So don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, 

everythings so tense and gloom, I

Almost feel like I got to check the temperture 

of the room just as soon as

I walk in, it's like all eyes on me, 

so I try to avoid any eye contact

Cause if I do that, then it opens the door 

for coversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention, 

I just want to be just like you



Blend in with the rest of the room, 

maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fuckin man servant, 

tryna follow me around and wipe my ass

And laugh at every single joke 

I crack and half of them ain't even funny like

""Ahh, Marshall you're so funny man 

you should be a comedian, god damn""

Unfortunately I am, I just hide 

behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down, 

listen to the tale I'm about to tell

Hell, we ain't gotta trade our shoes, 

and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Nobody asked for life to deal us 

what these bullshit hands were dealt

We gotta take these cards ourselves, 

and flip them, don't expect no help

Now I could of either just sat on my ass 

and pissed and moaned

Or take this situation in which I'm placed, 

and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door 

and pack his bags

Or sat on the porch and hoped and pray 

for a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, 

every school I went

I dreamed of being that cool kid, 

even if it meant actin stupid



And Aunt Edna was told me, 

keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that

Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue 

tryna talk like ""thissss""

Till I stuck my tongue on that 

frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old

I learned my lesson then,

cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, 

not just based on my description

Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin, 

it's probably 110 percent different

I guess we would have to walk a mile 

in each others shoes at least

What size you wear? I wear 10's, 

let's see if you could fit your feet...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Lately I've been hard to reach

I've been too long on my own

Everybody has their private world

Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?

Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. 

Dad will be home soon. 

And to the rest of the world, 

God gave you them shoes, to fit you, 

so put them on and wear em. Be yourself man. 

Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny, 

don't ever let anyone tell you, you ain't beautiful."

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for...
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,

The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:

Slim Shady!



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn

And we're starting this party from dusk



Ok... let's go



[Eminem:]

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk

Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust

Just one up my mothers son who got thrown under the bus

Kiss my butt. Lick from under cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks

It's a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.

Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.

Fist the cut. The lady give her eighty some paper cut.

Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought

Cause when I spit the verse the shit

Gets worse and worse cause your soft

If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time

Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.

I venture to say with the center of attention it's true

Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal

Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model.

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre



[Dr Dre:]

They see that low rider go by there, like Oh my!

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why.

I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.

I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.

Cause over and above all, it's just another day

And this one begins where the last one ends.

Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.

I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.

Driving around with a smashed front end

Let's cash that one in.

Grab another one from out the stable

The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado

The hell if I know.

Do I want leather seats or vinyl?

Decisions, decision

Garage looks like precision collision.

Or maico beats quake like Waco

Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model .

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent



[50 Cent:]

It's bottle after bottle

The money ain't a thang when you party with me

It's what we into it's simple

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe

I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm king kong

Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on

I'm so calm through vietnam ring the alarm

Bring the shaun dawn burn marajaun do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what

Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck

I spend it like it don't mean nothing

Blow it like it's suposed to be blown

Motherfucker I'm grown

I stunt I style I flash the shit

I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick

Fat ass burgandy bags classy shit jimmy cho shoes

I say move a bitch move



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model .

Under the ground, dig me up

Broken tibias, fibulas, yeah fix me up

60 sluts

All of em

Dying from asphyxia

After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeve sippy cup



Dixie cups, toxic, boxes of oxi pads

Enough oxi cotton to send a fucking ox to rehab

Whack job

In the back

In a black stocking cap

Jacking off to a hockey mask

At a boxing match



(He can't say that)



Yes he can

I just did faggot

Now guess again

Better text message her 

next to Ken(?)

Tell him shit's about to get extra messy

Especially when I 

Flex again

Throw a fucking lesbian in wet cement

Calamity

Goddammit

Pills

Fanny pack

Filled

With Zanies

Through every nook-n-cranny

Looking for trannies

Milk 'n' cookies

Spilled

On my silk, necklace, jade



Look



Razor b-lades with me

To make you b-leed

Cases of Maybelline

Make-up

Lay on a table

Of weed

Slim Shady

Shit sounds like a fable to me

Six semen samples

Seventeen strands of hair

Found in the back of a van

After the shoot at Vanity Fair

Hannah Montana

Prepare to elope with a can opener

And feet cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds



And Glad bags, yeah 

glad to be back

'Cause last year was a tragedy

That landed me smack dab in rehab

Fuckin' doctor

I ain't understand a damn what he said

I planned a relapse the second I walked out of that bitch



Two weeks in Brighton

Bitin' into a fuckin' biket and

light them a (?)

Might be a fucking sign

And I need a psychic

That means it's just a regular day

Shouldn't have had her legs in the way

Missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

[Verse 3]



Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming

To spit it back in abundance

Hit a fag with onions

And split a bag of Funyuns

Mad at me

Understandable

Cannibal

Shoot an animal

Out of a cannon

And have 'em catapult...

At an adult



Captain of a cult

With an elite following

To turn Halloween back

To a trick-or-treat holiday

Had Michael Myers lookin' like a liar

Swipe his powers

Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers



Hit Jason Voorhees with a forty

Stuck a suppository up his ass

And made him tell me a story



Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine

And sat him in a fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture



Walked up Elm street with a fucking (?)

Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too

And came out with a little scratch, ooh

Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple FAT Goose



Insanity

Can't it be

Vanity

Where's the humanity

In having a twisted fantasy

With an arm and leg amputee



Straitjacket 

Wit' a hundred and 8 brackets

And a strap that wraps twice around my back

Then they latch it

Cut your fuckin' head off and ask where you headed off to



Get it?

Headed off to?



Medic, this headache's awful

This anaesthetic's pathetic

So is this diabetic waffle

And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco!

Here comes the rain!

And thunder now!

No where to run!

To run to now!

I've disappeared!

Don't wonder how!

Looking for me!

If I woulda rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say something about Paul Wall, you'd probably crap in your

Pants, cause I'm white, and he's white, so he's like

My competition I mean, right?

Nope, Paul Wall is dope

And so's Bubba, so BLALALALAPFFTTTTT

B-b-b-b-b-but, I don't compete with nobody

I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali

Shuffle, and dance around my opponents, you don't

Sometime's I just play possom, Like I'm asleep that's awesome

I'm like a sleeping Giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre

I just jump from outta nowhere and bite Prey

Sink my teeth in him and fill him, full of poison

And make a noise like snake before I kill him

And let him know that I just don't feel him

And smack him with the backward E, the Eminem emblem

Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em

Tell em why, look them dead in the eye, then waste em

And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell

And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell

And the shadows of all who are willing to sell

Their souls, for this rap game, and it g-g-goes

123, 123, 123, that ain't the hook, now follow me

There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me

Everybody bores me, they're just so corny

So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror

The mirror grows lips and it whispers ""Come nearer""



[Chorus]

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



[Verse 2]

""Shady, I know you're in there, so where? Come here

Talk to me, sit here, pull up a chair

Why don't you gotcha hair? Hahahahaha

Dye it back, come on, try it"" AHHHHHHHHH

No, I told you, leave me the fuck alone will you?

""But I'm here to rebuild you"", But I already killed you!

""But Shady, we were meant for eachother

Think about your mother"", yeah so what of her?

""Well think about what she did to you and your little brother

All them foster homes..."", fuck you motherfucker!

I had you beat ""No I was playin' possom, remember?

I let you watch your little girls blossom

I gave you enough time, your souls mine

I'm taking it back"", you fuck bitch WHY!

""Because I love you, look a little closer

Isn't that us on that poster? haha""



[Chorus]

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



[Verse 3]

""Shady, listen... ""SHADY!"", you hear that?

They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back""

But I don't want it back! ""Yes you do...""

No I don't! ""Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!""

No I won't! ""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the doctor""

Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday

""Well I got him on the phone right now!""

You're lying, ""yo slim"", HOW, WHY NOW!

Whatup Dre? ""Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya

I don't know, it just seems every since you got off ya

Drugs, you became a lot softer""

But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka

""Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here

Just hit me back, and let me know what's up""

Fuck this mirror! AHHHHHHH

""I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you""

Fuck you, die you son of a bitch

""Put the gun down"", BYE BYE!

Ok I'm still alive, ""So am I too!

You can kill a spirit, even if you tried to

Haha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?

You remember that night you, prayed to god

You'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you

This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right through

Look at this house, look at these cars, I'm so nice, wooo!

Oh, but you didn't know, fame has a price too

That you're just now seeing the downside to

Lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too

Ain't even sure if your kids like you

Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without Nyquill

Become a valium addict, start a rehab cycle

But together we can break the cycle

Marshall..."" WHAT! ""no one's gonna love you like I do!""



[Chorus]

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I said, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body"

So this is it...
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Feigned to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different

But something changed

The minute that I got a whiff of it

I started to inhale it

Smell it

Started sniffin' it

And it became my cocaine

I just couldn't quit

I just wanted a little bit

Then it turned me (in) to a monster

I became a hypocrite

Concert after concert



I was raking in the dough

Rolling in green

Had the game hemmed up

Like a sewing machine

But I was losing my freedom

There was no where for me

To not go and be seen

And just go and be me

And there was no in-between

You either loved it or hate it



Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3

Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it

And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest

The Marshall Mathers was a classic

The Eminem Show was fantastic

But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it

I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet

A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic

And eight years later, I'm still at it

Divorce, re-married

A felon

A father

Sleeping pill addict

And this is real talk

I feel like the Incredible Hulk

My back has been broke, and I can still walk



[Chorus]

So be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold



I said



Be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold



[Verse 2]

I got a letter from a fan, that said

He's been praying for me

Every day and for some reason

It's been weighing on my mind heavy

'Cause I don't read every

Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but

Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?

You didn't pray for me when I was local

And as I lay these vocals

I think of all the shit I had to go through

Just to get to where I'm at

I've already told you at least



A thousand times in these rhymes

I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got

God on my side

And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?

Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint

Man, boy's got to look

Nuts

And that's the only word I can think of right now

On how

To describe the shit

This is like a vibe you get

Go ahead and bob to it

Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit



[Chorus]

So be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold



I said



Be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold"

You're walkin down a horror corridor

It's almost 4 in the mornin

And your in a

Nightmare

It's HORRIBLE

Right there's the coroner

Waitin for you

To turn the corner

So he can corner ya

Your a goner

He's ona ya

Out the corner of his cornea

He just saw you run

All you want is to rest

Cause you can't run anymore

Your done

All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience

While everybody

Is watchin in the party applauding it

Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again

Contemplading my next plot again

Swallowin the Klonopin

While I'm noddin

In and out on the autumn and

If the ramada inn

Holdin onto the pill bottle then

Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom

And make sure I got all of it

Wake up naked at mcdonalds

With

Blood all over me

Dead bodies

Behind the counter

SHIT

Guess I must of just blacked out again

NOT AGAIN



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



(Verse 2)

Sitting nude in my living room

It's almost noon

I wonder what's on the tube

Maybe they'll show some boobs

Surfing every channel

Until I find hannah montana

Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin

Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin

Every candle on top of the fire place

Mantalin

Grab my flannel and my bandana then

Kiss the naked manakin man again

You can see him standin in my

Front window

If you look in

I'm just a hooligan

Who's use to usin hallicinogens

Causin illusions again

Brain contusions again

Cutting and bruising the skin

Raise the scissors and pins

Jesus when does it end

Phases that I go through

Dazed and I'm so confused

Days that I don't know who

Gave these molecules too

Me

What am I gone do

Had the prodical son

The diabolical one

Very methodical

I slaughtered them



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again



I duck and I slash slice and gash

Last night was a blast

I can't quite remember when I

Had that much fun

Off a half pint of the jack

My last vic and a half

A flashlight

Up kim kardashians ass



I remember the first time

I dismembered a family member

December I think it was

I was having drinks with my cuz

And I wrapped him

In christmas lights

Pushed him into the stinkin tub

Cut him up into pieces

Then just when I went to drink his

Blood

I thought I outta drink this bath water

That outta be fun

That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun

The sight of blood excites me

That might be an artery son

Your blood curdling screams

Just don't seem to bother me none

It's 3 am

And here I come

So you should probably run

A secret passage way around here

Man there's got to be one

Oh no there's probably none

He can scream all that he wants

Top of his lungs

It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)



(Chorus)

Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

[Intro:]
Yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo Yo

Alright, I'm a lay the chorus first



Here we gooo now



[Chorus:]

My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am because I'm like her



Because My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Verse 1:]

My mom, my mom,

I know your probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom, Oooh whooa

But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty

And how I become hooked on vah-a-l-ium

Valium was in everything, food that I ate

The water that I drank, fuckin peas in my plate

She sprinkled just enough of it just to season my steak

So everyday I'd have at least three stomach aches

Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her

Son to grow up to be an under-afuckin-chiever

My teacher didn't think I was gunna be nothin either

""What the fuck you stickin gum up under the fuckin seat for? ""

""Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffin ether, ""

""Either that or the motherfuckers been puffin' reefer""

But all this huffin and puffin wasn't what it was either, it was neither

I was buzzin but it wasn't what she thought

Pee in teacup? Bitch you ain't my keeper I'm sleepin

What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for

Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin

Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!



[Chorus:]

My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am cause I'm like her



Because My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Verse 2:]

Wait a minute... This ain't dinner, this is paint thinner

""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints did I?

Now heres a plate full of pain killers, now just wait till I crush the valium

And put it in your potatoes, you little motherfucker,

I'll make you sit there and make that retarded fuckin face Without even tastin it.

You better lick that fuckin' plate you ain't wastin' it, put your face in it

'Fore I throw you in the basement again, and I ain't givin' in

Your gunna just sit there in one fuckin place spi?

Till next Thanksgiving and if you still ain't finished

Then I'll use the same shit again, then When I make spinach dip

It'll be placed in the shit.

You little shit Wanna sit there and play innocent

A rack filler hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it

Child support? Your father he ain't sent the shit

And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business kid""



[Bridge 1:]

My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom

I know I should let bygones be bygones

But shes the reason why I am high what I'm high on



[Chorus:]

My mom loves valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am cause I'm like her



Because My mom loves valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Bridge 2:]

My mom loves valium now while I am

There's a party animal, I am what I am

But I'm strong to the finish with me valium spinach

But my buzz only last about two minutes

But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it

I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it

My valium, My valiiiuuuuum



[Verse 3:]

Man I never thought I could never be a drug addict

Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me

But that actually what has ended up happenin'

A tradegy, of fuckin passin it up, catchin' me

And it's probably where I got aquanted with the taste, Ain't it

Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom, beautiful

She killed a fuckin dog with the medicine she done fed it

Feed a fuckin asprin and say that it has a headache

""Here want a snack, you hungry you fuckin brat? ""

""Look at that, it's a xanax, take it and take a nap! EAT IT! ""

But I DONT NEED IT!

""WELL FUCK IT, then break it up! ""

""Take a little piece then beat it, before you wake Nathan up! ""

Alright ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'

I'll do it, pop it gobble it, and start wobblin'

Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, tripped and I fall in bed

With a bottle of Meds, and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed

""Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead? ""

After I fuck you in the butt, get some head

Bust a nut, get some rest

The next day my mother said, ""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid""

The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared

He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead

Terry don't let that fucker get you upset

Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck

I bet you he's faking it

I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get

I'll go handle this of course unless you object

Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head



[Chorus:]

If you could count the skeletons in my closet

Under my bed and up under my faucet

Then you would know I've completely lost it

Is he nuts? No, he's insane



If you could count the skeletons in my closet

Under my bed and up under my faucet

Then you would know I've completely lost it

Is he nuts? No, he's insane



[Verse 2:]

You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off

I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw

Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off

Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot

Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop

Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong

Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong

That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong

Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn

And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on

Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off

Everything except his tank top and his training bra

Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog

Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?

Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?

Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)

Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?

Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching

Burp belch and go back for a second helping

Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?

I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me

Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping

Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!

What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!

Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being

No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing

I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see

I only get naked when the babysitter tells me

She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street

But actually it was called The Pubic Hair on Chelsie

Well this is called Ass-Rape and we should do the Jail scene

Fuckin' great man
Ok, let me see
How could I begin

Locked in mariahs wine cellar all I had for lunch,

Was red wine more red wine and some captain crunch,

Red wine for breakfast and for brunch,

And to soak it up and in between snack, crack ers to munch

Mariah what ever happened to us

Why did we have to break up

All I asked for was a glass of punch

Ya see I never really asked for much

I can't imagine what's

Going through your mind after such

A nasty break up with that latin hunk

Luis migul

Nick cannon better back the fuck up

I'm not playin I want her back ya punk

This is hello kitty bed spread satin funk

Mixed with egyptian with a little rap and punk

Zapp and eric clapton

Shaft, prince, abba, crunk

Ya baby

I want another crack at ya

You can beat me with any spatula that you want

man I really want you bad you cunt

Nick you had your fun

I've come to kick you in your sack of junk

Man I could use a fresh batch of blood

So prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from baghdad

When will it ever cease

For pete sakes he crazy to say the least

Bagpipes from baghdad

What's going through my mind

Half time when I rhyme

While blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

Somebody turn the vacancy sign on

Cause I'm gone

Blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

I run the streets and act like a mad man holding a glad...



[Verse 2:]

You could be a permanent fixture

In my lyrical mixture

I'm the miracle whip trickster

My signature sound

When a tube of lipsticks around

I'm bound to put it on in an instant

Wow man what an ensemble

What an assortment of pharma-

Ceuticals this beautiful pill does to my palm and

Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle

Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma

I'll cut you like dahmer

Pull a butcher knife on ya

The size of a sword boy

I'm like the fucking red sonja

Get it stuck in ya cornea

Nice knowing ya norman

Your so fucking annoying

Drop the shovel boy

You don't know what the fuck your doing

I ain't playing no fucking more

Nick cannon you prick I wish you luck with the fuckin whore

Every minute there's a sucker born

Snuck up on malachai

Made the motherfucker suck on shuck of corn

Chaka chaka khan chaka khan

Hit jason in the face with a hockey puck and

Told him it's fuckin on

Now what the fuck are you doing

Your running over the snow blower with the lawn mower blowing your bagpipes from baghdad



Bagpipes from baghdad

When will it ever cease

For pete sakes he crazy to say the least

Bagpipes from baghdad

What's going through my mind

Half time when I rhyme

While blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

Somebody turn the vacancy sign on

Cause I'm gone

Blowing on my

I run the streets and act like a mad man holding a glad bag...



In a bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables

I bet you they'll become heterosexual

Nothing will stop me from molesting you

Titty-fucking you 'till your breast nipples flesh tickle my testicles

It's what they said to the two conjoined twins

How's it going, girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?

You need some ointment? just set up an appointment

Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip

I've just got my one year sobriety chip

When the bad get going how bad is it gonna get

Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with each other

Especially when they're joined at the hip

I'm going to get a needle thread sewing kit

In attempt to separate the [? ] back at the loin, shit [? ]

Lure the little boy with the chocolate chips Ahoy!

Cookie, lookie, even took me a polaroid

Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse

Man I should check to see if my mom left any out

Nope, guess I'll re-route

Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch

Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth

Down the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it

A rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn ratchet

A tat-tac-tac in the hall with the damn hatchet

A nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs

Shorty come back, I'm tryin to score me some lapdances

I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels

Formula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules

The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya



[Chorus 1:]

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

And are you menstruating baby, my lil friend's waiting to say Hello

The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin like Jello

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello



[Verse 2:]

My equilibrium is off, must be the Lithium

I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em

It just becomes everyday extracurriculum

No reason in particular, it was strictly fun

A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151

51 people asleep in my damn living room

Scuse me hun? But what is your name, Vivian?

I woke up next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?

Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy on?

I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one

No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm

But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from

I find the fact that you, I'm cool, I immediately run like Speedy Gon-

Zalez to see if I see anyone

Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some

My head is pounding to the beat of the drum



[Chorus 2:]

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow?

Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello



[Verse 3:]

Oh, those were the days, they certainly were

It's hurtin me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good

(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)

I second that and a third, rush to emergency sur-

-gery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged

He's no longer getting the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-odans

Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in

Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin him'

Childishly on the phone tryin to rustle up muscle relax-

-ers for his back and a couple of packs

Since now he's doubling back-wards and he stumblin back

Slipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack

Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap

Almost ended it that soon because of the fact

I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap

Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back



[Chorus 2]



And so I'm sayin...



[Outro:]

Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)

My name is Shaaady

So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)

It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)

My name is Shaaady

I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)

Yo...
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move! All over the globe

Same song and dance

Something about it man

Same song and dance

In the Pale Moonlight

Yo...



[Verse 1:]

I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl

Your kind of tookin' back by

The whole rapper thing aren't ya?

Probably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard ya

Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?

Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster

The police constantly buggin' ya non-stop

I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya

I think ya got your OnStar button inside your car stuck.

You outta gas, do you gotta flat?

I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat

I got your back

Why don't you put your laundry basket in the back

And sit up front, not askin' it's a trap

You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a rap

In broad day, with no mask for this attack

I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract

If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get ya back

C'mon



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



[Verse 2:]

The first victim I had, she was a big one

Big movie star, a party girl, big fun

She was the girl the media always picked on

In and out of rehab, every 4 to 6 months

She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts

And Nickelodeon flashed her little kids once

What an event it was, I was sitting in front

I was hooked in it the first glimpse of them buns

Seen her back stage now here's where I come in son

Look here she comes I better pull out the big guns

Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin hun

How bout a ride to rehab, get in cunt

Starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want

Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again hun

See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention

Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension

You little Wench ya, murder wasn't my intention

If I wanted to kill you it would of already been done

Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her

With sixty-six inches of extension... cord.



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



[Verse 3:]

My second victim was even bigger then the first

Pop star, icon, the whole works

She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst

Upon the scene and seen that the world was hers

She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts

It irked me and made me mad at first

I lashed out through my songs but what was really going on

Was that I had developed a crush

I just didn't know how to tell it to her...

Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?

Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons

Of, footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?

We'll settle this once and for all, I'm a tell her at dusk

Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must

Creep up, to her mansion in stilettos and just

Climb the gate and ring the bell like hello my love,

I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up!

Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?

I'll share my valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney!

I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one

Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent

I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you

Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value

Come-on toots, give me the valium alleyoop...

I'll slam dunk it in your mouth til you puke

And just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup

I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit out of you

New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit out of you

Shoot! Now show me how you move baby do how well ya do



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



Same kickin' and screamin' same cryin' and sobbin'

Same song and dance...

Same diggin' and pleadin' same yellin' and bleedin'

Same song and dance

Yeah

Same song and dance

I know

Same song and dance"

Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

You're a rock star (Baby!)

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)

Player!

Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)

We're the ones who made you!



Back by popular demand

Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can

You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand

How does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?

Well look at all the massive masses in the stands

Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans

Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man

She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive gluteus maximus again

Squeeze it then squash it then pass it to a friend

Can he come back as nasty as he can?

Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend

But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men

Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten

I know you want me girl, in fact I see ya grin

Now come in girl!

The enforcer, look at the more women to torture

Walk up to the cutest girl and charlie-horse her

Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres

Have that I don't? Are you tellin' me tenderness?

Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman

Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine

And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then

Nail her, ""Baby, say hello to my little friend""

Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middleman

Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again

And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge

Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention

And little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench

Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch

They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim's



When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)

And that's why, my love, you never live without

I know you want me girl

'Cause I can see you're checkin' me out

And baby, you know, you know you want me too

Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you



Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa

Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?

You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album

Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but

Jessica Alba, put a breast on my mouth, bruh

Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers

And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt

Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit

I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica

Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya

Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake

Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake

With a sawblade in it to make my jailbreak

Baby, I think you just met your soulmate

Now break it down, girl!

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, get down (Baby!)

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Oh my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no! I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop it

[Verse 1:]

Welcome to the slim shady Mecca Rebeca

It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca

It's my sector homosexual dissector

Come again, rewind selector

I said nice rectum I had a visectomy Hector

So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya

Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya

I tantalize ya in and less than 5 seconds I get ya

They say once bitten and twice shy

Well I'm next to the guy with 9 extacy pills and 5 extra

Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yessir

I took the rest of the lunesta pills from my dresser

It's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?

Drop kick the bitch before her second trimester

Perform a home abortion with Dexter then I guess I

Dig the fetus out with the wire hanging and digest her



[Chorus:]

I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Let's begin, now hand me the pen

How should I begin it and where does it all end?

The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in (I said)

I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Let's begin, now hand me the pen

How should I begin it and where does it all end?

My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends



[Verse 2:]

All my westside bitches throw it up

Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up

Man I think that he just fell up the teat and shown enough

So you better change the station and keep them throwin up

Man you seen it all before, you are too familiar with it

There's a penis on floor and two balls, so you know who did it?

You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't

I won't rape all The Pussy Cat Dolls' and then call you Kitten

Now I'll pee on Rhianna, see man I do what I wanna

Spray perfume in her sauna room, Krazy Gluing Madonna

To the Lay-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her

Imagine the visual for that man, who would've thought I

Could ever be such a relentless prick

Unleashin his vengance for the chick

So old she looks like she outlived her life sentence

I never ment this rhyme to be so offensive

If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand

Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand

Here you need a hand big man? grab hold of this branch

With both hands but they don't understand I'm just a sick man

Now everybody's pissed at me

Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words geez

So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves

Won't you brake it down for me and just spit the verse please?



Eminem I'm coming to kill you (sniff)

I've always hated you and I still do

You'll never fill my shoes, my superman costume (sniff)

Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you

You're taking this shit too far (sniff)

Who do you think you are? In my suit up in the armoire

Everyday I hate you more and more, throw down the carboard

Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore



[Chorus]



The world is mine!"

Come with me to the dark side of the force (force)
No man would vote for your to this place
The devil only knows of this world

So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

Soon as my flow starts

I compose art like the ghost of Mozart

Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't

Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart

Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go

(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?

Where do they go? God only knows

(Stay wide awake)



[Verse 1:]

3-5-4-4

I think I smell the scent of a placenta

I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December

I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender

Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta

Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-

-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea

Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya

I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda

Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-

-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-

-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Mur-derin I'd rather go 'vrinn-vrinn' and now you see just how the

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa

Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull

Pull another one out uhhh



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me

There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me

But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my

It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me

So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?

Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep

And I creep right through the front seat

So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep

Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?

He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me

He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny

She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak

Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy

Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties

I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty

Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

But I'd tried to stay wide awake

Cause you might be found dead by the lake

Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take

Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?

I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?

Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets

How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya

Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there

I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya

Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya

Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower

Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars

Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da

Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta

Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya

Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water

Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand

Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe

Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that

What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Good evening!
This is your fuckin' captain speaking!
We will soon be reaching an altitude of... 4 million and a half feet

That's 8 million miles in the sky!

Please!

Undo your seat belt for take off

You are now free to smoke about the cabin.

Tik-it!



[Verse 1:]

[Dr. Dre:] I'm Dre from - back in the day from

N.W.A from - back in the grave from

Chokin' a bitch to - smacking her face from

Stacking up bodies to - blacken they case up from.

Racking up hits to - stacking them crates up.

I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm!

And we was happening and rap entertainment,

Me and shady for us competition, faggot there ain't none! (EM: yeah!)

[Eminem:] Speak of the devil, it's the attack of the rain man,

Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron.

Soon as the blades spun vrun they run away from,

Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from!

In search of a brain surgeon the great one,

Wait it ain't funny man it's urgent I need one.

Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun,

And a emergency squirtgun to spray everyone.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So one more time for old time's sake! [scratches]

Dre drop that beat! - And scratch that break!

Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go! (Tik-it! We're now smoking with the best, the best! Tik-it!)



I said one more time for old time's sake [scratches]

Dre drop that beat! - And scratch that break!

Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go! (Tik-it! we're now smoking with the best, the best! Tik-it!)



[Verse 2:]

[Eminem:] Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless

A nice environment!

Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants

Taking lives of firemen

Say goodbye, here I am again. - Naked wives and Vicodin,

Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy I could spin.

Vin-vin! - Fuck the handle! I fly off the hinge!

Let the boy off the bench coach and throw it to him.

There he goes in his trench coat and them clothes again,

Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin.

I'll show you every inch girls of my foreskin,

Show me nipple, I pinch both and throw up a ten.

Now you know it's a sin to tease blow us again

The sorcerer of intercourse if it's forced it's him.

""Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within

When you wake in the morning next to the porcelain! ""



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

[Dr. Dre:] Now where there's smoke there's fire - where there's fire there's flames

Where there's flames there's chronic - either you high or you ain't.

I got no time for no games. (Eminem: Nah-ah he ain't playing!)

[Eminem:] He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your bra-in

I'm slightly insa-ne! - Vodka and Creatine

Hypnotic and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink.

And it's giving me wings! - I believe I can fly.

While I pee on the girl you won't catch me CSI!

It's as easy as pie! - And as simple as cake.

Dre get on the mic [scratches] and make them tremble and shake!

[Dr. Dre:] Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your hand and your coke

And if you really want to get fucked up! - Just let me know!

We can smoke if there is no more lighter fluid to do it,

Let's get into it! - You smoking with the triedest and truest.

I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up

You muthafuckers ain't smoking, you just holding shit up!

Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt

I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one.

Cause if at first you don't succeed. - Won't hurt to smoke some weed.

Now them words are just a little more personal for me

Seeing as how - I blew up off puffing them trees

[Eminem {Dre}:] Was luck enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up cheech!

Come on smoke me up cause, get me contact buzz!

Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff!

""But this is Earth calling Shady, man come on back! "" (whaaaat?)

""Man we're losing him! He won't even respond back fuck!

Now look at all the pretty women in here. {Damn bitches! }

It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the drill

Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill

You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel

Like I don't think anyone's real,

Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer

Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,

Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama

Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,

Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza

How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,

Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,

Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,

Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,

The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate

And which motel which lake they found her in,

And how they attacked the victim,

Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,

Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,

So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like

Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light

Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way

Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?

Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms

Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,

He can give her some, she can give him some

Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome

You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm

Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up

Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a

Titanium brain that's full of, surprises

When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes

You stare into your stereos eyes

Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,

I didn't even smoke anything, I didn't even drink anything



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind"

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then I salivate
Start off with the nyquil like I think I'll just have a taste

Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate

Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great

I go to take just one and I end up like having eight

Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate

Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak

And you'd think with all I have at stake

Look at my daughters face...

Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think

He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me

Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me

And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos

And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

Soon as I go home and close the door,

Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

And why I just don't know...



[Verse 2:]

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer

That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year

And that fucker still talks to me he is all I can fuckin hear

Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers

And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half as buzzed for half of the time

Who's the mastermind behind that little line

With that kind of rational mind I got half a mind

To have another half a glass of wine sound asinine

Ya I know

But I never had no problem with alcohol

Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall

I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball

Shit must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all

Wow what the fuck happend last night where am I

Man fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache

Shit half a vicodin why can't I?

"" All systems ready for take off please stand by ""



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

Soon as I go home and close the door,

Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

And why I just don't know...



[Verse 3:]

So I take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh

A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high

Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by

Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die

Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use

There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through

It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze

What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes

Now here I am 3 months later full blown relapse

Just get high untill the kids get home from school homes relax

And since I'm convinced that I'm an in-somniac

I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps

Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see

That's an ambien each nap how many valium 3

And that will average out to about one good hour sleep

Ok so now you see the reason how come he

Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b

See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath

Cause that christmas you know the pneumonia thing

It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think

Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos

Your vcr tape cases with your ambien cr great places to hide ain't it

So you can lie to hailie I'm going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina

Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance

They said they found me on the bathroom floor



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

Soon as I go home and close the door,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



I'm just so fuckin depressed, 

I just can't seem to get out this slump

If I could just get over this hump, 

but I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps, 

fell down and I got right back up

But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 

in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when I ended up 

in this position I'm in

I'm startin to feel distant again, 

so I decided just to pick this pen



Up and try to make an attempt to vent 

but I just can't admit or come to grips

With the fact that I may be done with rap, 

I need a new outlet

And I know some shit so hard to swallow, 

but I just can't sit back and wallow

In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, 

I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow

I'll be one tough act to follow

Here today, gone tomorrow, 

but you'd have to walk a thousand miles...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



But don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



So don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, 

everythings so tense and gloom, I

Almost feel like I got to check the temperture 

of the room just as soon as

I walk in, it's like all eyes on me, 

so I try to avoid any eye contact

Cause if I do that, then it opens the door 

for coversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention, 

I just want to be just like you



Blend in with the rest of the room, 

maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fuckin man servant, 

tryna follow me around and wipe my ass

And laugh at every single joke 

I crack and half of them ain't even funny like

""Ahh, Marshall you're so funny man 

you should be a comedian, god damn""

Unfortunately I am, I just hide 

behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down, 

listen to the tale I'm about to tell

Hell, we ain't gotta trade our shoes, 

and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Nobody asked for life to deal us 

what these bullshit hands were dealt

We gotta take these cards ourselves, 

and flip them, don't expect no help

Now I could of either just sat on my ass 

and pissed and moaned

Or take this situation in which I'm placed, 

and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door 

and pack his bags

Or sat on the porch and hoped and pray 

for a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, 

every school I went

I dreamed of being that cool kid, 

even if it meant actin stupid



And Aunt Edna was told me, 

keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that

Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue 

tryna talk like ""thissss""

Till I stuck my tongue on that 

frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old

I learned my lesson then,

cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, 

not just based on my description

Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin, 

it's probably 110 percent different

I guess we would have to walk a mile 

in each others shoes at least

What size you wear? I wear 10's, 

let's see if you could fit your feet...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Lately I've been hard to reach

I've been too long on my own

Everybody has their private world

Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?

Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. 

Dad will be home soon. 

And to the rest of the world, 

God gave you them shoes, to fit you, 

so put them on and wear em. Be yourself man. 

Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny, 

don't ever let anyone tell you, you ain't beautiful."

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for...
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,

The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:

Slim Shady!



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn

And we're starting this party from dusk



Ok... let's go



[Eminem:]

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk

Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust

Just one up my mothers son who got thrown under the bus

Kiss my butt. Lick from under cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks

It's a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.

Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.

Fist the cut. The lady give her eighty some paper cut.

Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought

Cause when I spit the verse the shit

Gets worse and worse cause your soft

If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time

Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.

I venture to say with the center of attention it's true

Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal

Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model.

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre



[Dr Dre:]

They see that low rider go by there, like Oh my!

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why.

I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.

I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.

Cause over and above all, it's just another day

And this one begins where the last one ends.

Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.

I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.

Driving around with a smashed front end

Let's cash that one in.

Grab another one from out the stable

The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado

The hell if I know.

Do I want leather seats or vinyl?

Decisions, decision

Garage looks like precision collision.

Or maico beats quake like Waco

Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model .

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent



[50 Cent:]

It's bottle after bottle

The money ain't a thang when you party with me

It's what we into it's simple

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe

I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm king kong

Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on

I'm so calm through vietnam ring the alarm

Bring the shaun dawn burn marajaun do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what

Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck

I spend it like it don't mean nothing

Blow it like it's suposed to be blown

Motherfucker I'm grown

I stunt I style I flash the shit

I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick

Fat ass burgandy bags classy shit jimmy cho shoes

I say move a bitch move



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model .

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

Dre, I'm down here

Under the ground, dig me up

Broken tibias, fibulas, yeah fix me up

60 sluts

All of em

Dying from asphyxia

After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeve sippy cup



Dixie cups, toxic, boxes of oxi pads

Enough oxi cotton to send a fucking ox to rehab

Whack job

In the back

In a black stocking cap

Jacking off to a hockey mask

At a boxing match



(He can't say that)



Yes he can

I just did faggot

Now guess again

Better text message her 

next to Ken(?)

Tell him shit's about to get extra messy

Especially when I 

Flex again

Throw a fucking lesbian in wet cement



(So)



Faggoty faggoty faggoty raggedy

Ann and Andy

No

Raggedy Andy and Andy

No it can't be it can't be

Yes it can be

The fucking Anti-Christ is back Danny

It's Satan in black satin panties



This is Amityville

Calamity

Goddammit

Insanity

Pills

Fanny pack

Filled

With Zanies

Through every nook-n-cranny

Looking for trannies

Milk 'n' cookies

Spilled

On my silk, necklace, jade



Look



Razor b-lades with me

To make you b-leed

Cases of Maybelline

Make-up

Lay on a table

Of weed

Slim Shady

Shit sounds like a fable to me

'till he jumps out the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

Here comes the rain!

No where to run!

To run to now!

Looking for me!

[Verse 2]



Six semen samples

Seventeen strands of hair

Found in the back of a van

After the shoot at Vanity Fair

Hannah Montana

Prepare to elope with a can opener

And feet cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds



And Glad bags, yeah 

glad to be back

'Cause last year was a tragedy

That landed me smack dab in rehab

Fuckin' doctor

I ain't understand a damn what he said

I planned a relapse the second I walked out of that bitch



Two weeks in Brighton

I ain't enlightened

Bitin' into a fuckin' biket and

light them a (?)

Oh

Lightning is striking

Might be a fucking sign

And I need a psychic

Evaluation

Fuck Jason

It's Friday the 19th



That means it's just a regular day

And this is the kind of shit I think of regu-lar-ly

Fuckin' lesbians

Shouldn't have had her legs in the way

Now she's pregnant and gay

Missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

Here comes the rain!

And thunder now!

No where to run!

To run to now!

Don't wonder how!

Don't wonder how!

Looking for me!

[Verse 3]



Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming

To spit it back in abundance

Hit a fag with onions

And split a bag of Funyuns

Mad at me

Understandable

Cannibal

Shoot an animal

Out of a cannon

And have 'em catapult...

At an adult



Captain of a cult

With an elite following

To turn Halloween back

To a trick-or-treat holiday

Had Michael Myers lookin' like a liar

Swipe his powers

Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers



Hit Jason Voorhees with a forty

Stuck a suppository up his ass

And made him tell me a story



Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine

And sat him in a fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture



Walked up Elm street with a fucking (?)

Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too

And came out with a little scratch, ooh

Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple FAT Goose



Insanity

Can't it be

Vanity

Where's the humanity

In having a twisted fantasy

With an arm and leg amputee



Straitjacket 

Wit' a hundred and 8 brackets

And a strap that wraps twice around my back

Then they latch it

Cut your fuckin' head off and ask where you headed off to



Get it?

Headed off to?



Medic, this headache's awful

This anaesthetic's pathetic

So is this diabetic waffle

And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco! 



[Chorus]



Here comes the rain!

And thunder now!

No where to run!

To run to now!

I've disappeared!

Don't wonder how!

Looking for me!

I'm underground!



Here comes the rain!

And thunder now!

No where to run!

To run to now!

I've disappeared!

Don't wonder how!

Looking for me!

I'm underground!"

Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're a rock star (Baby!)

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)

Player!

Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)

We're the ones who made you!



Back by popular demand

Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can

You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand

How does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?

Well look at all the massive masses in the stands

Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans

Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man

She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive gluteus maximus again

Squeeze it then squash it then pass it to a friend

Can he come back as nasty as he can?

Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend

But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men

Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten

I know you want me girl, in fact I see ya grin

Now come in girl!



When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)

You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)

You're a rock star (Baby!)

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)

Player!

Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)

We're the ones who made you!



The enforcer, look at the more women to torture

Walk up to the cutest girl and charlie-horse her

Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres

Have that I don't? Are you tellin' me tenderness?

Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman

Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine

And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then

Nail her, ""Baby, say hello to my little friend""

Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middleman

Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again

And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge

Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention

And little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench

Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch

They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim's



When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)

You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)

You're a rock star (Baby!)

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)

Player!

Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)

We're the ones who made you!



And that's why, my love, you never live without

I know you want me girl

'Cause I can see you're checkin' me out

And baby, you know, you know you want me too

Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you



Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa

Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?

You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album

Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but

Jessica Alba, put a breast on my mouth, bruh

Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers

And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt

Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit

I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica

Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya

Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake

Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake

With a sawblade in it to make my jailbreak

Baby, I think you just met your soulmate

Now break it down, girl!



When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)

You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)

You're a rock star (Baby!)

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)

Player!

Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)

We're the ones who made you!



So baby, baby

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, get down (Baby!)

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, get down



Oh Amy!

If I woulda rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say something about Paul Wall, you'd probably crap in your

Pants, cause I'm white, and he's white, so he's like

My competition I mean, right?

Nope, Paul Wall is dope

And so's Bubba, so BLALALALAPFFTTTTT

B-b-b-b-b-but, I don't compete with nobody

I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali

Shuffle, and dance around my opponents, you don't

Sometime's I just play possom, Like I'm asleep that's awesome

I'm like a sleeping Giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre

I just jump from outta nowhere and bite Prey

Sink my teeth in him and fill him, full of poison

And make a noise like snake before I kill him

And let him know that I just don't feel him

And smack him with the backward E, the Eminem emblem

Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em

Tell em why, look them dead in the eye, then waste em

And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell

And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell

And the shadows of all who are willing to sell

Their souls, for this rap game, and it g-g-goes

123, 123, 123, that ain't the hook, now follow me

There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me

Everybody bores me, they're just so corny

So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror

The mirror grows lips and it whispers ""Come nearer""



[Chorus]

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



[Verse 2]

""Shady, I know you're in there, so where? Come here

Talk to me, sit here, pull up a chair

Why don't you gotcha hair? Hahahahaha

Dye it back, come on, try it"" AHHHHHHHHH

No, I told you, leave me the fuck alone will you?

""But I'm here to rebuild you"", But I already killed you!

""But Shady, we were meant for eachother

Think about your mother"", yeah so what of her?

""Well think about what she did to you and your little brother

All them foster homes..."", fuck you motherfucker!

I had you beat ""No I was playin' possom, remember?

I let you watch your little girls blossom

I gave you enough time, your souls mine

I'm taking it back"", you fuck bitch WHY!

""Because I love you, look a little closer

Isn't that us on that poster? haha""



[Chorus]

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



[Verse 3]

""Shady, listen... ""SHADY!"", you hear that?

They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back""

But I don't want it back! ""Yes you do...""

No I don't! ""Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!""

No I won't! ""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the doctor""

Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday

""Well I got him on the phone right now!""

You're lying, ""yo slim"", HOW, WHY NOW!

Whatup Dre? ""Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya

I don't know, it just seems every since you got off ya

Drugs, you became a lot softer""

But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka

""Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here

Just hit me back, and let me know what's up""

Fuck this mirror! AHHHHHHH

""I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you""

Fuck you, die you son of a bitch

""Put the gun down"", BYE BYE!

Ok I'm still alive, ""So am I too!

You can kill a spirit, even if you tried to

Haha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?

You remember that night you, prayed to god

You'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you

This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right through

Look at this house, look at these cars, I'm so nice, wooo!

Oh, but you didn't know, fame has a price too

That you're just now seeing the downside to

Lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too

Ain't even sure if your kids like you

Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without Nyquill

Become a valium addict, start a rehab cycle

But together we can break the cycle

Marshall..."" WHAT! ""no one's gonna love you like I do!""



[Chorus]

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body



I said, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, you and me were meant to be together

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body"

So this is it...
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Feigned to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different

But something changed

The minute that I got a whiff of it

I started to inhale it

Smell it

Started sniffin' it

And it became my cocaine

I just couldn't quit

I just wanted a little bit

Then it turned me (in) to a monster

I became a hypocrite

Concert after concert



I was raking in the dough

Rolling in green

Had the game hemmed up

Like a sewing machine

But I was losing my freedom

There was no where for me

To not go and be seen

And just go and be me

And there was no in-between

You either loved it or hate it



Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3

Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it

And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest

The Marshall Mathers was a classic

The Eminem Show was fantastic

But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it

I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet

A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic

And eight years later, I'm still at it

Divorce, re-married

A felon

A father

Sleeping pill addict

And this is real talk

I feel like the Incredible Hulk

My back has been broke, and I can still walk



[Chorus]

So be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold



I said



Be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold



[Verse 2]

I got a letter from a fan, that said

He's been praying for me

Every day and for some reason

It's been weighing on my mind heavy

'Cause I don't read every

Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but

Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?

You didn't pray for me when I was local

And as I lay these vocals

I think of all the shit I had to go through

Just to get to where I'm at

I've already told you at least



A thousand times in these rhymes

I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got

God on my side

And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?

Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint

Man, boy's got to look

Nuts

And that's the only word I can think of right now

On how

To describe the shit

This is like a vibe you get

Go ahead and bob to it

Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit



[Chorus]

So be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold



I said



Be careful what you wish for

'Cause you just might get it

And if you get it then you just might not know

What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

Come back on you ten-fold"

You're walkin down a horror corridor

It's almost 4 in the mornin

And your in a

Nightmare

It's HORRIBLE

Right there's the coroner

Waitin for you

To turn the corner

So he can corner ya

Your a goner

He's ona ya

Out the corner of his cornea

He just saw you run

All you want is to rest

Cause you can't run anymore

Your done

All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience

While everybody

Is watchin in the party applauding it

Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again

Contemplading my next plot again

Swallowin the Klonopin

While I'm noddin

In and out on the autumn and

If the ramada inn

Holdin onto the pill bottle then

Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom

And make sure I got all of it

Wake up naked at mcdonalds

With

Blood all over me

Dead bodies

Behind the counter

SHIT

Guess I must of just blacked out again

NOT AGAIN



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



(Verse 2)

Sitting nude in my living room

It's almost noon

I wonder what's on the tube

Maybe they'll show some boobs

Surfing every channel

Until I find hannah montana

Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin

Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin

Every candle on top of the fire place

Mantalin

Grab my flannel and my bandana then

Kiss the naked manakin man again

You can see him standin in my

Front window

If you look in

I'm just a hooligan

Who's use to usin hallicinogens

Causin illusions again

Brain contusions again

Cutting and bruising the skin

Raise the scissors and pins

Jesus when does it end

Phases that I go through

Dazed and I'm so confused

Days that I don't know who

Gave these molecules too

Me

What am I gone do

Had the prodical son

The diabolical one

Very methodical

I slaughtered them



(Chorus)

It's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

Killed em



I said

It's 3 am in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again

She puts the lotion in the bucket

He puts the lotion on the skin

Or else it gets the hose again



I duck and I slash slice and gash

Last night was a blast

I can't quite remember when I

Had that much fun

Off a half pint of the jack

My last vic and a half

A flashlight

Up kim kardashians ass



I remember the first time

I dismembered a family member

December I think it was

I was having drinks with my cuz

And I wrapped him

In christmas lights

Pushed him into the stinkin tub

Cut him up into pieces

Then just when I went to drink his

Blood

I thought I outta drink this bath water

That outta be fun

That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun

The sight of blood excites me

That might be an artery son

Your blood curdling screams

Just don't seem to bother me none

It's 3 am

And here I come

So you should probably run

A secret passage way around here

Man there's got to be one

Oh no there's probably none

He can scream all that he wants

Top of his lungs

It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)



(Chorus)

Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin

Put my key in the door and

Bodies layin all of the floor and

I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em

It's 3 am in the mornin

[Intro:]
Yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo Yo

Alright, I'm a lay the chorus first



Here we gooo now



[Chorus:]

My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am because I'm like her



Because My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Verse 1:]

My mom, my mom,

I know your probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom, Oooh whooa

But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty

And how I become hooked on vah-a-l-ium

Valium was in everything, food that I ate

The water that I drank, fuckin peas in my plate

She sprinkled just enough of it just to season my steak

So everyday I'd have at least three stomach aches

Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her

Son to grow up to be an under-afuckin-chiever

My teacher didn't think I was gunna be nothin either

""What the fuck you stickin gum up under the fuckin seat for? ""

""Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffin ether, ""

""Either that or the motherfuckers been puffin' reefer""

But all this huffin and puffin wasn't what it was either, it was neither

I was buzzin but it wasn't what she thought

Pee in teacup? Bitch you ain't my keeper I'm sleepin

What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for

Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin

Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!



[Chorus:]

My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am cause I'm like her



Because My mom love valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Verse 2:]

Wait a minute... This ain't dinner, this is paint thinner

""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints did I?

Now heres a plate full of pain killers, now just wait till I crush the valium

And put it in your potatoes, you little motherfucker,

I'll make you sit there and make that retarded fuckin face Without even tastin it.

You better lick that fuckin' plate you ain't wastin' it, put your face in it

'Fore I throw you in the basement again, and I ain't givin' in

Your gunna just sit there in one fuckin place spi?

Till next Thanksgiving and if you still ain't finished

Then I'll use the same shit again, then When I make spinach dip

It'll be placed in the shit.

You little shit Wanna sit there and play innocent

A rack filler hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it

Child support? Your father he ain't sent the shit

And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business kid""



[Bridge 1:]

My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom

I know I should let bygones be bygones

But shes the reason why I am high what I'm high on



[Chorus:]

My mom loves valium and lots of drugs

That's why I am like I am cause I'm like her



Because My mom loves valium and lots of drugs

That's why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm My Mom!



[Bridge 2:]

My mom loves valium now while I am

There's a party animal, I am what I am

But I'm strong to the finish with me valium spinach

But my buzz only last about two minutes

But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it

I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it

My valium, My valiiiuuuuum



[Verse 3:]

Man I never thought I could never be a drug addict

Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me

But that actually what has ended up happenin'

A tradegy, of fuckin passin it up, catchin' me

And it's probably where I got aquanted with the taste, Ain't it

Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom, beautiful

She killed a fuckin dog with the medicine she done fed it

Feed a fuckin asprin and say that it has a headache

""Here want a snack, you hungry you fuckin brat? ""

""Look at that, it's a xanax, take it and take a nap! EAT IT! ""

But I DONT NEED IT!

""WELL FUCK IT, then break it up! ""

""Take a little piece then beat it, before you wake Nathan up! ""

Alright ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'

I'll do it, pop it gobble it, and start wobblin'

Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, tripped and I fall in bed

With a bottle of Meds, and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed

""Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead? ""

After I fuck you in the butt, get some head

Bust a nut, get some rest

The next day my mother said, ""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid""

The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared

He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead

Terry don't let that fucker get you upset

Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck

I bet you he's faking it

I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get

I'll go handle this of course unless you object

Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head



[Chorus:]

If you could count the skeletons in my closet

Under my bed and up under my faucet

Then you would know I've completely lost it

Is he nuts? No, he's insane



If you could count the skeletons in my closet

Under my bed and up under my faucet

Then you would know I've completely lost it

Is he nuts? No, he's insane



[Verse 2:]

You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off

I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw

Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off

Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot

Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop

Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong

Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong

That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong

Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn

And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on

Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off

Everything except his tank top and his training bra

Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog

Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?

Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?

Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)

Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?

Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching

Burp belch and go back for a second helping

Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?

I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me

Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping

Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!

What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!

Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being

No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing

I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see

I only get naked when the babysitter tells me

She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street

But actually it was called The Pubic Hair on Chelsie

Well this is called Ass-Rape and we should do the Jail scene

Ok, let me see
How could I begin

Locked in mariahs wine cellar all I had for lunch,

Was red wine more red wine and some captain crunch,

Red wine for breakfast and for brunch,

And to soak it up and in between snack, crack ers to munch

Mariah what ever happened to us

Why did we have to break up

All I asked for was a glass of punch

Ya see I never really asked for much

I can't imagine what's

Going through your mind after such

A nasty break up with that latin hunk

Luis migul

Nick cannon better back the fuck up

I'm not playin I want her back ya punk

This is hello kitty bed spread satin funk

Mixed with egyptian with a little rap and punk

Zapp and eric clapton

Shaft, prince, abba, crunk

Ya baby

I want another crack at ya

You can beat me with any spatula that you want

man I really want you bad you cunt

Nick you had your fun

I've come to kick you in your sack of junk

Man I could use a fresh batch of blood

So prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from baghdad

When will it ever cease

For pete sakes he crazy to say the least

Bagpipes from baghdad

What's going through my mind

Half time when I rhyme

While blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

Somebody turn the vacancy sign on

Cause I'm gone

Blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

I run the streets and act like a mad man holding a glad...



[Verse 2:]

You could be a permanent fixture

In my lyrical mixture

I'm the miracle whip trickster

My signature sound

When a tube of lipsticks around

I'm bound to put it on in an instant

Wow man what an ensemble

What an assortment of pharma-

Ceuticals this beautiful pill does to my palm and

Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle

Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma

I'll cut you like dahmer

Pull a butcher knife on ya

The size of a sword boy

I'm like the fucking red sonja

Get it stuck in ya cornea

Nice knowing ya norman

Your so fucking annoying

Drop the shovel boy

You don't know what the fuck your doing

I ain't playing no fucking more

Nick cannon you prick I wish you luck with the fuckin whore

Every minute there's a sucker born

Snuck up on malachai

Made the motherfucker suck on shuck of corn

Chaka chaka khan chaka khan

Hit jason in the face with a hockey puck and

Told him it's fuckin on

Now what the fuck are you doing

Your running over the snow blower with the lawn mower blowing your bagpipes from baghdad



Bagpipes from baghdad

When will it ever cease

For pete sakes he crazy to say the least

Bagpipes from baghdad

What's going through my mind

Half time when I rhyme

While blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

Somebody turn the vacancy sign on

Cause I'm gone

Blowing on my

Bagpipes from baghdad

I run the streets and act like a mad man holding a glad bag...



In a bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables

I bet you they'll become heterosexual

Nothing will stop me from molesting you

Titty-fucking you 'till your breast nipples flesh tickle my testicles

It's what they said to the two conjoined twins

How's it going, girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?

You need some ointment? just set up an appointment

Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip

I've just got my one year sobriety chip

When the bad get going how bad is it gonna get

Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with each other

Especially when they're joined at the hip

I'm going to get a needle thread sewing kit

In attempt to separate the [? ] back at the loin, shit [? ]

Lure the little boy with the chocolate chips Ahoy!

Cookie, lookie, even took me a polaroid

Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady

I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)



[Verse 1:]

You see that chick in the gym checking me out?

Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth

I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wrecking the house

That was suppose to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?

Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse

Man I should check to see if my mom left any out

Nope, guess I'll re-route

Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch

Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth

Down the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it

A rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn ratchet

A tat-tac-tac in the hall with the damn hatchet

A nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs

Shorty come back, I'm tryin to score me some lapdances

I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels

Formula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules

The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya



[Chorus 1:]

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

And are you menstruating baby, my lil friend's waiting to say Hello

The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin like Jello

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello



[Verse 2:]

My equilibrium is off, must be the Lithium

I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em

It just becomes everyday extracurriculum

No reason in particular, it was strictly fun

A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151

51 people asleep in my damn living room

Scuse me hun? But what is your name, Vivian?

I woke up next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?

Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy on?

I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one

No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm

But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from

I find the fact that you, I'm cool, I immediately run like Speedy Gon-

Zalez to see if I see anyone

Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some

My head is pounding to the beat of the drum



[Chorus 2:]

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow?

Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello



[Verse 3:]

Oh, those were the days, they certainly were

It's hurtin me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good

(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)

I second that and a third, rush to emergency sur-

-gery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged

He's no longer getting the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-odans

Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in

Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin him'

Childishly on the phone tryin to rustle up muscle relax-

-ers for his back and a couple of packs

Since now he's doubling back-wards and he stumblin back

Slipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack

Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap

Almost ended it that soon because of the fact

I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap

Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back



[Chorus 2]



And so I'm sayin...



[Outro:]

Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)

My name is Shaaady

So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)

It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)

My name is Shaaady

I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)

Yo...
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move! All over the globe

Same song and dance

Something about it man

Same song and dance

In the Pale Moonlight

Yo...



[Verse 1:]

I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl

Your kind of tookin' back by

The whole rapper thing aren't ya?

Probably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard ya

Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?

Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster

The police constantly buggin' ya non-stop

I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya

I think ya got your OnStar button inside your car stuck.

You outta gas, do you gotta flat?

I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat

I got your back

Why don't you put your laundry basket in the back

And sit up front, not askin' it's a trap

You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a rap

In broad day, with no mask for this attack

I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract

If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get ya back

C'mon



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



[Verse 2:]

The first victim I had, she was a big one

Big movie star, a party girl, big fun

She was the girl the media always picked on

In and out of rehab, every 4 to 6 months

She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts

And Nickelodeon flashed her little kids once

What an event it was, I was sitting in front

I was hooked in it the first glimpse of them buns

Seen her back stage now here's where I come in son

Look here she comes I better pull out the big guns

Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin hun

How bout a ride to rehab, get in cunt

Starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want

Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again hun

See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention

Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension

You little Wench ya, murder wasn't my intention

If I wanted to kill you it would of already been done

Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her

With sixty-six inches of extension... cord.



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



[Verse 3:]

My second victim was even bigger then the first

Pop star, icon, the whole works

She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst

Upon the scene and seen that the world was hers

She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts

It irked me and made me mad at first

I lashed out through my songs but what was really going on

Was that I had developed a crush

I just didn't know how to tell it to her...

Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?

Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons

Of, footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?

We'll settle this once and for all, I'm a tell her at dusk

Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must

Creep up, to her mansion in stilettos and just

Climb the gate and ring the bell like hello my love,

I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up!

Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?

I'll share my valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney!

I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one

Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent

I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you

Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value

Come-on toots, give me the valium alleyoop...

I'll slam dunk it in your mouth til you puke

And just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup

I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit out of you

New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit out of you

Shoot! Now show me how you move baby do how well ya do



[Hook:]

Yeah baby, do that dance

It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do

Girl shake that ass

You ain't ever gonna break that glass

The windshields too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

You sexy little thing

Show me what you got, give it your all

Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?

Same song and dance...



Same kickin' and screamin' same cryin' and sobbin'

Same song and dance...

Same diggin' and pleadin' same yellin' and bleedin'

Same song and dance

Yeah

Same song and dance

I know

Same song and dance"

Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

You're a rock star (Baby!)

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)

Player!

Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)

We're the ones who made you!



Back by popular demand

Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can

You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand

How does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?

Well look at all the massive masses in the stands

Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans

Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man

She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive gluteus maximus again

Squeeze it then squash it then pass it to a friend

Can he come back as nasty as he can?

Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend

But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men

Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten

I know you want me girl, in fact I see ya grin

Now come in girl!

The enforcer, look at the more women to torture

Walk up to the cutest girl and charlie-horse her

Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres

Have that I don't? Are you tellin' me tenderness?

Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman

Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine

And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then

Nail her, ""Baby, say hello to my little friend""

Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middleman

Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again

And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge

Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention

And little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench

Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch

They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim's

I know you want me girl

'Cause I can see you're checkin' me out

And baby, you know, you know you want me too

Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you



Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa

Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?

You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album

Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but

Jessica Alba, put a breast on my mouth, bruh

Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers

And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt

Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit

I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica

Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya

Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake

Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake

With a sawblade in it to make my jailbreak

Baby, I think you just met your soulmate

Now break it down, girl!

Oh my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no! I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop it

[Verse 1:]

Welcome to the slim shady Mecca Rebeca

It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca

It's my sector homosexual dissector

Come again, rewind selector

I said nice rectum I had a visectomy Hector

So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya

Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya

I tantalize ya in and less than 5 seconds I get ya

They say once bitten and twice shy

Well I'm next to the guy with 9 extacy pills and 5 extra

Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yessir

I took the rest of the lunesta pills from my dresser

It's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?

Drop kick the bitch before her second trimester

Perform a home abortion with Dexter then I guess I

Dig the fetus out with the wire hanging and digest her



[Chorus:]

I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Let's begin, now hand me the pen

How should I begin it and where does it all end?

The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in (I said)

I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Let's begin, now hand me the pen

How should I begin it and where does it all end?

My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends



[Verse 2:]

All my westside bitches throw it up

Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up

Man I think that he just fell up the teat and shown enough

So you better change the station and keep them throwin up

Man you seen it all before, you are too familiar with it

There's a penis on floor and two balls, so you know who did it?

You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't

I won't rape all The Pussy Cat Dolls' and then call you Kitten

Now I'll pee on Rhianna, see man I do what I wanna

Spray perfume in her sauna room, Krazy Gluing Madonna

To the Lay-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her

Imagine the visual for that man, who would've thought I

Could ever be such a relentless prick

Unleashin his vengance for the chick

So old she looks like she outlived her life sentence

I never ment this rhyme to be so offensive

If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand

Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand

Here you need a hand big man? grab hold of this branch

With both hands but they don't understand I'm just a sick man

Now everybody's pissed at me

Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words geez

So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves

Won't you brake it down for me and just spit the verse please?



Eminem I'm coming to kill you (sniff)

I've always hated you and I still do

You'll never fill my shoes, my superman costume (sniff)

Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you

You're taking this shit too far (sniff)

Who do you think you are? In my suit up in the armoire

Everyday I hate you more and more, throw down the carboard

Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore

I compose art like the ghost of Mozart

Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go

(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?

Where do they go? God only knows

(Stay wide awake)



[Verse 1:]

3-5-4-4

I think I smell the scent of a placenta

I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December

I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender

Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta

Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-

-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea

Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya

I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda

Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-

-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-

-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Mur-derin I'd rather go 'vrinn-vrinn' and now you see just how the

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa

Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull

Pull another one out uhhh



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me

There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me

But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my

It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me

So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?

Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep

And I creep right through the front seat

So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep

Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?

He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me

He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny

She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak

Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy

Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties

I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty

Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

But I'd tried to stay wide awake

Cause you might be found dead by the lake

Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take

Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?

I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?

Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets

How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya

Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there

I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya

Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya

Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower

Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars

Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da

Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta

Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya

Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water

Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand

Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe

Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that

What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Good evening!
This is your fuckin' captain speaking!
We will soon be reaching an altitude of... 4 million and a half feet

That's 8 million miles in the sky!

Please!

Undo your seat belt for take off

You are now free to smoke about the cabin.

Tik-it!



[Verse 1:]

[Dr. Dre:] I'm Dre from - back in the day from

N.W.A from - back in the grave from

Chokin' a bitch to - smacking her face from

Stacking up bodies to - blacken they case up from.

Racking up hits to - stacking them crates up.

I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm!

And we was happening and rap entertainment,

Me and shady for us competition, faggot there ain't none! (EM: yeah!)

[Eminem:] Speak of the devil, it's the attack of the rain man,

Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron.

Soon as the blades spun vrun they run away from,

Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from!

In search of a brain surgeon the great one,

Wait it ain't funny man it's urgent I need one.

Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun,

And a emergency squirtgun to spray everyone.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So one more time for old time's sake! [scratches]

Dre drop that beat! - And scratch that break!

Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go! (Tik-it! We're now smoking with the best, the best! Tik-it!)



I said one more time for old time's sake [scratches]

Dre drop that beat! - And scratch that break!

Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way

And let's go! (Tik-it! we're now smoking with the best, the best! Tik-it!)



[Verse 2:]

[Eminem:] Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless

A nice environment!

Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants

Taking lives of firemen

Say goodbye, here I am again. - Naked wives and Vicodin,

Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy I could spin.

Vin-vin! - Fuck the handle! I fly off the hinge!

Let the boy off the bench coach and throw it to him.

There he goes in his trench coat and them clothes again,

Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin.

I'll show you every inch girls of my foreskin,

Show me nipple, I pinch both and throw up a ten.

Now you know it's a sin to tease blow us again

The sorcerer of intercourse if it's forced it's him.

""Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within

When you wake in the morning next to the porcelain! ""



[Chorus]

[Dr. Dre:] Now where there's smoke there's fire - where there's fire there's flames

Where there's flames there's chronic - either you high or you ain't.

I got no time for no games. (Eminem: Nah-ah he ain't playing!)

[Eminem:] He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your bra-in

I'm slightly insa-ne! - Vodka and Creatine

Hypnotic and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink.

And it's giving me wings! - I believe I can fly.

While I pee on the girl you won't catch me CSI!

It's as easy as pie! - And as simple as cake.

Dre get on the mic [scratches] and make them tremble and shake!

[Dr. Dre:] Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your hand and your coke

And if you really want to get fucked up! - Just let me know!

We can smoke if there is no more lighter fluid to do it,

Let's get into it! - You smoking with the triedest and truest.

I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up

You muthafuckers ain't smoking, you just holding shit up!

Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt

I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one.

Cause if at first you don't succeed. - Won't hurt to smoke some weed.

Now them words are just a little more personal for me

Seeing as how - I blew up off puffing them trees

[Eminem {Dre}:] Was luck enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up cheech!

Come on smoke me up cause, get me contact buzz!

Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff!

""But this is Earth calling Shady, man come on back! "" (whaaaat?)

""Man we're losing him! He won't even respond back fuck!

Now look at all the pretty women in here. {Damn bitches! }

Dre it's hot I think we better go check on their temperatures.

I get the thermometer you get the bandages,

Now baby just bend over this won't hurt a damn bitness!

I feel like dancing
I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me (high)

I said I smell something in the air that's making me high



Ok here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, I'm so la-di-da so

Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco

You mother fuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs

Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos

Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole

She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto

Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso

Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so

You know how that go, skull and the crossbones

This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know

You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice)

This is niether the time or the place to get macho

So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos

Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow

It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though

Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the drill

Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill

You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel

Like I don't think anyone's real,

Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer

Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,

Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama

Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,

Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza

How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,

Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,

Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,

Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,

The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate

And which motel which lake they found her in,

And how they attacked the victim,

Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,

Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,

So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like

Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light

Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way

Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?

Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms

Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,

He can give her some, she can give him some

Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome

You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm

Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up

Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a

Titanium brain that's full of, surprises

When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes

You stare into your stereos eyes

Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,

I didn't even smoke anything, I didn't even drink anything



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind



It must be the ganja

It's the marijuana

That's creepin upon me why I'm so high

Maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me

Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind"

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then I salivate
Start off with the nyquil like I think I'll just have a taste

Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate

Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great

I go to take just one and I end up like having eight

Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate

Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak

And you'd think with all I have at stake

Look at my daughters face...

Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think

He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me

Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me

And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos

And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

Soon as I go home and close the door,

Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

And why I just don't know...



[Verse 2:]

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer

That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year

And that fucker still talks to me he is all I can fuckin hear

Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers

And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half as buzzed for half of the time

Who's the mastermind behind that little line

With that kind of rational mind I got half a mind

To have another half a glass of wine sound asinine

Ya I know

But I never had no problem with alcohol

Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall

I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball

Shit must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all

Wow what the fuck happend last night where am I

Man fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache

Shit half a vicodin why can't I?

"" All systems ready for take off please stand by ""



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

Soon as I go home and close the door,

Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

And why I just don't know...



[Verse 3:]

So I take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh

A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high

Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by

Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die

Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use

There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through

It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze

What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes

Now here I am 3 months later full blown relapse

Just get high untill the kids get home from school homes relax

And since I'm convinced that I'm an in-somniac

I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps

Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see

That's an ambien each nap how many valium 3

And that will average out to about one good hour sleep

Ok so now you see the reason how come he

Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b

See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath

Cause that christmas you know the pneumonia thing

It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think

Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos

Your vcr tape cases with your ambien cr great places to hide ain't it

So you can lie to hailie I'm going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina

Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance

They said they found me on the bathroom floor



[Hook:]

Sometimes I feel so alone,

I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,

So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,

I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



I'm just so fuckin depressed, 

I just can't seem to get out this slump

If I could just get over this hump, 

but I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps, 

fell down and I got right back up

But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 

in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when I ended up 

in this position I'm in

I'm startin to feel distant again, 

so I decided just to pick this pen



Up and try to make an attempt to vent 

but I just can't admit or come to grips

With the fact that I may be done with rap, 

I need a new outlet

And I know some shit so hard to swallow, 

but I just can't sit back and wallow

In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, 

I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow

I'll be one tough act to follow

Here today, gone tomorrow, 

but you'd have to walk a thousand miles...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



But don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



So don't let them say you ain't beautiful

They can all get FUCKED, just stay true to you



I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, 

everythings so tense and gloom, I

Almost feel like I got to check the temperture 

of the room just as soon as

I walk in, it's like all eyes on me, 

so I try to avoid any eye contact

Cause if I do that, then it opens the door 

for coversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention, 

I just want to be just like you



Blend in with the rest of the room, 

maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fuckin man servant, 

tryna follow me around and wipe my ass

And laugh at every single joke 

I crack and half of them ain't even funny like

""Ahh, Marshall you're so funny man 

you should be a comedian, god damn""

Unfortunately I am, I just hide 

behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down, 

listen to the tale I'm about to tell

Hell, we ain't gotta trade our shoes, 

and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Nobody asked for life to deal us 

what these bullshit hands were dealt

We gotta take these cards ourselves, 

and flip them, don't expect no help

Now I could of either just sat on my ass 

and pissed and moaned

Or take this situation in which I'm placed, 

and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door 

and pack his bags

Or sat on the porch and hoped and pray 

for a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, 

every school I went

I dreamed of being that cool kid, 

even if it meant actin stupid



And Aunt Edna was told me, 

keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that

Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue 

tryna talk like ""thissss""

Till I stuck my tongue on that 

frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old

I learned my lesson then,

cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, 

not just based on my description

Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin, 

it's probably 110 percent different

I guess we would have to walk a mile 

in each others shoes at least

What size you wear? I wear 10's, 

let's see if you could fit your feet...



In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me, 

I'll be you, let's trade shoes

Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain, 

you feel mine, go inside each others minds

Just to see what we'd find, 

look at shit through each others eyes



Lately I've been hard to reach

I've been too long on my own

Everybody has their private world

Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?

Are you trying to get through?

Are you reaching out for me?

I'm reaching out for you...



Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. 

Dad will be home soon. 

And to the rest of the world, 

God gave you them shoes, to fit you, 

so put them on and wear em. Be yourself man. 

Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny, 

don't ever let anyone tell you, you ain't beautiful."

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for...
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,

The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:

Slim Shady!



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn

And we're starting this party from dusk



Ok... let's go



[Eminem:]

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk

Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust

Just one up my mothers son who got thrown under the bus

Kiss my butt. Lick from under cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks

It's a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.

Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.

Fist the cut. The lady give her eighty some paper cut.

Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought

Cause when I spit the verse the shit

Gets worse and worse cause your soft

If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time

Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.

I venture to say with the center of attention it's true

Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal

Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model.

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre



[Dr Dre:]

They see that low rider go by there, like Oh my!

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why.

I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.

I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.

Cause over and above all, it's just another day

And this one begins where the last one ends.

Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.

I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.

Driving around with a smashed front end

Let's cash that one in.

Grab another one from out the stable

The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado

The hell if I know.

Do I want leather seats or vinyl?

Decisions, decision

Garage looks like precision collision.

Or maico beats quake like Waco

Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model .

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent



[50 Cent:]

It's bottle after bottle

The money ain't a thang when you party with me

It's what we into it's simple

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe

I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm king kong

Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on

I'm so calm through vietnam ring the alarm

Bring the shaun dawn burn marajaun do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what

Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck

I spend it like it don't mean nothing

Blow it like it's suposed to be blown

Motherfucker I'm grown

I stunt I style I flash the shit

I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick

Fat ass burgandy bags classy shit jimmy cho shoes

I say move a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model .

Dre, I'm down here

Under the ground, dig me up

Broken tibias, fibulas, yeah fix me up

60 sluts

All of em

Dying from asphyxia

After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeve sippy cup



Dixie cups, toxic, boxes of oxi pads

Enough oxi cotton to send a fucking ox to rehab

Whack job

In the back

In a black stocking cap

Jacking off to a hockey mask

At a boxing match



(He can't say that)



Yes he can

I just did faggot

Now guess again

Better text message her 

next to Ken(?)

Tell him shit's about to get extra messy

Especially when I 

Flex again

Throw a fucking lesbian in wet cement



(So)



Faggoty faggoty faggoty raggedy

Ann and Andy

No

Raggedy Andy and Andy

No it can't be it can't be

Yes it can be

The fucking Anti-Christ is back Danny

It's Satan in black satin panties



This is Amityville

Calamity

Goddammit

Insanity

Pills

Fanny pack

Filled

With Zanies

Through every nook-n-cranny

Looking for trannies

Milk 'n' cookies

Spilled

On my silk, necklace, jade



Look



Razor b-lades with me

To make you b-leed

Cases of Maybelline

Make-up

Lay on a table

Of weed

Slim Shady

Shit sounds like a fable to me

'till he jumps out the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

Six semen samples

Seventeen strands of hair

Found in the back of a van

After the shoot at Vanity Fair

Hannah Montana

Prepare to elope with a can opener

And feet cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds



And Glad bags, yeah 

glad to be back

'Cause last year was a tragedy

That landed me smack dab in rehab

Fuckin' doctor

I ain't understand a damn what he said

I planned a relapse the second I walked out of that bitch



Two weeks in Brighton

I ain't enlightened

Bitin' into a fuckin' biket and

light them a (?)

Oh

Lightning is striking

Might be a fucking sign

And I need a psychic

Evaluation

Fuck Jason

It's Friday the 19th



That means it's just a regular day

And this is the kind of shit I think of regu-lar-ly

Fuckin' lesbians

Shouldn't have had her legs in the way

Now she's pregnant and gay

Missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

Here comes the rain!

And thunder now!

No where to run!

To run to now!

Don't wonder how!

Looking for me!

I'm underground! 



[Verse 3]



Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming

To spit it back in abundance

Hit a fag with onions

And split a bag of Funyuns

Mad at me

Understandable

Cannibal

Shoot an animal

Out of a cannon

And have 'em catapult...

At an adult



Captain of a cult

With an elite following

To turn Halloween back

To a trick-or-treat holiday

Had Michael Myers lookin' like a liar

Swipe his powers

Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers



Hit Jason Voorhees with a forty

Stuck a suppository up his ass

And made him tell me a story



Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine

And sat him in a fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture



Walked up Elm street with a fucking (?)

Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too

And came out with a little scratch, ooh

Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple FAT Goose



Insanity

Can't it be

Vanity

Where's the humanity

In having a twisted fantasy

With an arm and leg amputee



Straitjacket 

Wit' a hundred and 8 brackets

And a strap that wraps twice around my back

Then they latch it

Cut your fuckin' head off and ask where you headed off to



Get it?

Headed off to?



Medic, this headache's awful

This anaesthetic's pathetic

So is this diabetic waffle

And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco! 



[Chorus]



Here comes the rain!

And thunder now!

No where to run!

To run to now!

I've disappeared!

Don't wonder how!

Looking for me!

I'm underground!



Here comes the rain!

And thunder now!

No where to run!

To run to now!

I've disappeared!

Don't wonder how!

Looking for me!

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you

Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be

My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds



Momma had a baby and it's head popped off

(head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)

My momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off

(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)

Ring ring ring, on the door bell of the next door neighbors on their front porch

(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)

But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn

(elses lawn, elses lawn, elses lawn)

Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt, uncle Edna 'n Charles

(Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)

They were the ones who were left in charge

My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song

(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)

It went a little something like mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb

Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn

Momma why do they keep saying this I just dont understand, understand

And by the way, where's my dad?



[Chorus]



Predominantly, predominantly, everythings always predominantly

Predominantly white, predominantly black

Well, what about me, where does that leave me

Well I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em

I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream

While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?

Do you think that I'm kidding?

What do I look like some kind of idi-wait a minute, shit, don't answer that

Why am I so misunderstood?

Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit, it's tush mull bish

Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again

Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in

And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad

And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it

Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it

I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard

Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it

Man if I only had half of it.

If you only knew the half of it



[Chorus]



Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds

Please release me from these deamons

I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe

I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry

Now look at all the pain I caused

Dear Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again

What did I do that was so bad to deserve this

Everything could have been so perfect

But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air

Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere

I don't even know what it feel like, they know me cuz I'm in this ferris wheel

And all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel

Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round

Here we go now, doe see doe now, curtains up, the show must go now

Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now

But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be

Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be

So please god, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on

Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things

Sometimes I forget what other people just may think

A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me

If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me

I maybe a little too fast paced and racy

Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times

cuz I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing

And I could give a fuck what category you place me

Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone

As long as you place me amongst one of them greats

When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z

For every single die hard fan who embraced me

I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me

And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me

Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me

In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me

It only made me what I am today, see

Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me

You ain't gonna make or break me

Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G

You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening

Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me

And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me

You had all this time to think about it

Now don't pussy out and try to about face me

Cuz I've been patiently waiting for the day

That we finally meet in the same place to see



[Chorus x2 - Nate Dogg]

No matter how many battles I been in and won

No matter how many magazines on my nuts

No matter how many MC's I eat up

Ooh ooh, it's never enough



[50 Cent]

My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it

Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics

You go say the wrong shit and get your face split

The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it

I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit

Graze it, your peace talk, save it

You shit sounds dated, you're overrated

I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers

If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse

Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?

I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it

To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic

My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it

Chew it or pop it, roll a bag or chop it

Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it

When it's hot, it's hot

Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. If you wish to be
saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or
which over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should
move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better.

[Verse 1- Eminem]

Come on, let's cut the bullshit enough

Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up

Let's take this shit back to bassmint

And we can disscuss statements thats made on this tape

And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love

The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy

Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit

Crossin 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory

I'd like to share a story, this is my story and cant no body tell it for me

You will well inform me, I am well aware that I don't belong here

You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere

From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there

From the black side all the way to the white side

Okay there's a bright side a day that I might slide

You may call it a past I call it haulin my ass

Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks

Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks

Them good old notorious oh well known tracks



[Chorus x2]

Come on lets go back

Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode

Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

I once used to call home sweet home



[Verse 2- Eminem]

I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter

Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike

Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and Van Dyke

And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard

And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark

To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark

To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's

Thats about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps

At Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doin some talent shows

At Centerline High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime

He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme

I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place

And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike

We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit with compound syllables sound combined

From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line



[Chorus x2]

Come on lets go back

Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode

Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

I once used to call home sweet home



[Verse 3- Eminem]

My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school

It was cool till your man MC Sham came through

And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the clan makes troops

It was rumors but man god damned they flew

Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes

I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too

And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news

Guess who came through next, X clam debut

Professor X and glorious exists in a state of red, black, and green

With a key sissies now with this bein a new trend

We don't fit in crackas is out with Cactus albums

Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions

Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant

Me and my man Howard and would go to the mall with 'em

All over our necks like we're showin 'em off not knowin at all

We was bein laughed at you ain't even half black

You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that

And that Flavor Flave clock we gon' have to snatch that

All I remember is meetin back at Manix's basement

Sayin how we hate this, our races wit dope the x clan take this

Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time

She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl

At our school who thought I was cool cuz I rapped so she was kinda eyein me

And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gon' say it plus

The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs

The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it

Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time

But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy

And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl 

But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad

But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize

I was wrong cuz no matter what color a girl is she still a hoe



[Chorus x2]

Come on lets go back

Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode

Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

left right left, we all fall down...
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit, torn apart

We never win but the battle wages on 

For toy soldiers



I'm supposed to be the soldier

Who never blows his composure

Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders, 

I ain't never supposed to show it

My crew ain't supposed to know it

Even if it means going toe to toe with a Benzino

It don't matter



I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle

'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example

I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em

If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em



That Ja shit, I tried to squash it

It was too late to stop it

There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it

I heard him say Hailie's name on a song

And I just lost it it was crazy

The shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit



And even though the battle is won, I feel like we lost it

I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted

And I'm so caught in it

I almost feel I'm the one who caused it

This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it



That was never my object, for someone to get killed

Why would I want to destroy something I helped build?

It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good

I went through my whole career without ever mentioning



And that was just outta respect, for not running my mouth

And talking about something that I knew nothing about

Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef

So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth



While he's all over TV

Down-talking the man who literally saved my life

Like, fuck it, I understand

This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business

I'm still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute, cause



Step by step, heart to heart

Left, right, left we all fall down 

Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit, torn apart

We never win but the battle wages on 

For toy soldiers



There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and

Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'

But now it's elevated

Cause once you put someone's kids in it

The shit gets escalated it ain't just words no more, is it?



It's a different ball game

You call names and you ain't just rappin'

We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'

Me and Dre had sat with him

Kicked it and had a chat with him

And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him



Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him

Fuck it, ""50, smash him! Mash him and let him have it!""

Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction

Some receptionist at the Source

Who answers phones at his desk



Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection

Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record

But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up, 

Was through that publication

The same one that made me famous



Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?

Well, fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him then!

But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think

That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc



And he's inherited mine, which is fine

Ain't like either of us mind

We still have soldiers that's on the front line

That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders

Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us



And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus

To show 'em we love 'em back

And let them know how important it is

To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners

Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is



But I ain't tryin' to have none of my people hurt or murdered

It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it

Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict

I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further



But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'

I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'

Off at your jaws, well, then I can

Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'. 

I'm not going to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience, cause



Step by step, heart to heart

Left, right, left we all fall down 

Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit, torn apart 

We never win but the battle wages on 

For toy soldiers"

And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible...
It feels so good to be back..

I scrutinize every word, memorize every line

I spit it once, refuel and re-energize and rewind

I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind

I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time

It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as

I say to fight, you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass

If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask

A father who has grown up with a fatherless past

Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has

Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task

And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft

Slash entrepreneur who has held onto few more rap acts

Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half

Of his career typical manure moving past that

Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act

Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back



[Chorus:]

Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness

As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed

Carry on, give me hope, give me strength

Come with me and I won't steer you wrong

Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog

To the light at the end of the tunnel

We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march

Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh

Take us right through the doors (c'mon)



All the people up top on the side and the middle

Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little

Just let it gradually build from the front to the back

All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black

Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together

To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather

If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better

They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever

They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go

Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know

Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)



[Chorus]



Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us

Mosh pits outside the oval office

Someone's tryina tell us something,

Maybe this is god just sayin' we're responsible

For this monster, this coward,

That we have empowered

This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'

How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists

Now this is our final hour

Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice

Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise

Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six...

Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch

Maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech

Let the president answer a higher anarchy

Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war

Let him impress daddy that way

No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil

No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal

If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero

Look in his eyes its all lies

The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped

And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die

If I get sniped tonight you know why,

Cause I told you to fight.



[Chorus]



And as we proceed,

To Mosh through this desert storm,

In these closing statements, if they should argue

Let us beg to differ

As we set aside our differences

And assemble our own army

To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction

That we call our President, for the present

And Mosh for the future of our next generation

To speak and be heard

Mr. President, Mr. Senator

Do you guy's hear us...hear us...[laughing] (Hailie)"

You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach

You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

You may not think you do, but you do

Every time I think of you I puke



I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem

But off of the dome would probably be a little more, more suitable for this type of song--whoa

I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of

Sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta

So fuck it, I'ma start right here by just be brief-a

Bout to rattle off some other reasons

I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you

On my arm, but what do I go and do

I go and get another one, now I got two

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin

I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again

My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim

Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it

For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through

Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you

You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach

Every time I think of you, I puke

You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

You may not think you do, but you do

Every time I think of you I puke



I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter

But I thought a song would probably be a little better

Instead of a letter

That you'd probably just shred up--yeah

I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of

How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a

Paper, I'd rather let you see how

Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle

You're a fuckin' coke-head slut, I hope you fuckin' die

I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye

I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut, I hope you die

Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie

But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad

It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back

It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna

gag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag

What else can I do, I haven't got a clue

Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to

But every time I think of you now, I'll I wanna do

Is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke



[Chorus]

You don't know how sick you make me

You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach

Every time I think of you, I puke

You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

You may not think you do, but you do

And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me

Wake up gay and make up with Ray (Hey!)

You find me offensive? I find you offensive

For finding me offensive

Hence if I should draw a line on any fences

If so to what extense if

Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive

Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive

They say that I cause extensive 

Pshycological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lenghts this,

Far at other people's expenses

I say your all just too god damn sensitive

It's censorship

And it's down right blasphomous

Listen to shit now cause I won't stand for this

And Chirs-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither

And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either

He used to be like a hero to me

I even believe I, had one of those 25 cent stickers on my re--fridgerator

Right next to Darth Vader

And Darth must have put a hex on him for later

I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that

I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther

I killed Superman, I killed Super--man

And how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy

Kryptonite: The Green Chronic



[Chorus:]

Cause I ain't got no legs!

Or no brain, nice to meet you

Hi, my name is...

I forgot my name!

My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame

My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is....

Rain Man



Now in the Bible it says

Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed,

Have homosexual sex

Unless of course you were given the consent to join in

Then of course, it's intercourse

And it's bi-sexual sex

Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions

Either before, during or after peforming the act of that which

Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases

That are more used by today's kids

In a more derogatory way but

Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?

Let's ask Dr. Dre 

Dr. Dre? (What up?)

I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)

Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)

And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)

But, ut! I ain't done yet

In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt

While he reaches in another grown man's ass

Grabs on his nuts but just what if

It was never meant it was just an accident

But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in

His teeny tiny little round hiney but he didn't mean it

But his little weenie flinched just a little bit

And I don't mean to go in into any more details but

What if he pictured it as a females butt?

Is that gay? I just need to clear things up

Til then i'll just walk around with a manly strut because...



[Chorus]



You find me offensive, I find you offensive

Shit, this is the same verse I just did this

When am I gonna come to my good senses?

Probably the day Bush comes to my defenceses

My spider senses telling me Spiderman is nearby

And my plan is to get him next

And open up a whip ass canister

God damn it Dre where is the god damn beat? (Yeah)

Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it

This is the only thing that I'm good at

I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic

Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it

I got it, high five Nick Lachey

Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away

And she blew around the room like a balloon-a

Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna

Out the trash can and screw my

Head is straight back to the Neverland Ranch

With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwhich

And I don't gotta make no god damn sense

I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit



[Chorus]

Cause IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH

Yo, Rain Man

Definately, definately Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and

Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million

Nine hundred and n seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three

And seventy (Yeah)"

Why are you being so mean?
You're mean mean man
[Chorus]
You are just jealous of me 

Cuz you, you just can't do what I do

So instead of just admitting it

You walk around and say

All kinds of really mean things

About me cuz you're a meanie, a meanie

But it's only cuz you're

Just really jealous of me

Cuz I'm what you want to be

So you just look like an idiot

When you say these mean things

Cuz it's too easy to see

You're just a really big weenie, big weenie



[Verse 1]

Alright listen, I need you to focus

I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important

We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts

I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment

Now I need you to open your mind-your eyes close them

You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis

For the next four and a half minutes

We are going to explore into your mind

To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous

Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?

Hippity ga-ga boo-boo

Psych, I'm kidding

I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'

Ok, now I need your undivided attention

Sir I have a question

Why do I always sense this undeniable tension

From the moment that I enter into the room

It gets all quiet and whispers

Whenever theres conversation, why am I always mentioned?

I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me

Is it just because



[Chorus]



[Verse 2]

Alright now I, I just flubbed a line

I was going to say something extremely important

But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up

Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't

That's just what you wanted to hear from me

Is that I fucked up ain't it?

But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper

It doesn't take a bunch of takes

Or me to stand here in this booth all day

For me to say the truth, ok?

You're droolin, you have tooth decay

Your mouth is open, you're disgusting

What the fuck you eat for lunch

A bunch of sweets or something, what?

You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?

Your tooth is rotten to the gum

Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?

Yes I do sir, what am I on?

You sir are on chew syrum

Marshall I'm so jealous of you

Please say you won't tell nobody

I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified

That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying

All these terrible, evil and awful mean things

It's my own insecurity!



[Chorus]



[Verse 3]

Alright now we, we're going to conduct

That experiment that we were talking about earlier

Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy

Cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?

Here's a mirror, notice the resemblence here?

Wait, let me put these sun glasses on

Now look in this mirror, how about now?

What do you have in common?

You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em

You look like I sound like singing about weenies

Now take my weenie out of your mouth

This is between me and you, I know you're not happy

I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying

Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying

There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is

Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges

Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless

Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is tortuous

My point is this

That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink

Now I fogot what the chorus is, your just is...

And I know that he's not 'thrilled' about the video
What does he 'wanna be startin' somethin'?'
Well I'll show him who's really 'bad'
Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls

You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'

And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop till I get enough'

Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video?

Well he'll always be that Michael to me

And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white'

Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons

And I hope they all fucking die!

How do you like that?

And I like him, I like him a lot

I want to touch him but I can't

Excuse me, I'm taking a shit

Sorry

Anyways, call me back

I have this idea about how I want to end the show

So, hit me when you get this message fucker

Come here, little kiddies! On my lap!

Guess who's back with a brand new rap?

And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case

Of child molestation accusations

Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries

Papa's got a brand new bag of toys

What else could I possibly do to make noise?

I've done touched on everything but little boys

That's not a stab at Michael

That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho

I go a little bit crazy sometimes



I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes

Good God, dip, do a little slide

Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide

To the center of the dance floor

Like TP for my bung-hole

And it's cool if you let one go

Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)

I'm in jail and I don't know what happened

They say I was runnin' butt naked

Down the street screamin' (ah ah ah ah)

All I know is this much, I'm not guilty

They said ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape

Yellin' at an old lady"" (Touch my body!)



Now this is the part where the rap breaks down

It gets real intense, no one makes a sound

Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now

The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves

Now snap back to reality; look, there's B. Rabbit!

If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from

[Obie Trice]

I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control

Even though my penis was deep down in your hole

You should know between us we was like mates to soul

Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes

You was more or so the chalant type, I chose

To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose

That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows

In the beginning, friends we decided to roll

So who's responsible when you get excited, explode

And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold

But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate

We established this way before we became mates

So whats required is that you chill with all that fire

Get your desire when I retire



[Chorus]

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

I never thought I'd find someone to be mine

Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine



[Eminem]

I used to say I never met a girl like you before

Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are

Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters

Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers

Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for

Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore

You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours

All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls

If you recall I used to treat you as a groupie broad

When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off

But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off

It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on

You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue

And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me

And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly

Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me

It's true that I got shot in the heart

But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are

But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see

Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach

Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat

Before you make a decision that's life altering

And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave

You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring



[Chorus]



[Stat Quo]

In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch

My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch

But you was different, thought we shared a covenant

Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this

Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit

Tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick

I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit

Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss

We started off closer than close

But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth

And the final result, back in that same boat

I ask myself, do I love these hoes? NO!



[50 cent]

Em introduced us, ""50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50""

Then slid off and left her to kick it with me

I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips

With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick

We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast

Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass

Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline

Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind

She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too

Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?

Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice

Yeah, yeah, know how many times had I heard that shit?

I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?

You got me



Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad

When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had

I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh

I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?

Daddy's with you in your prayers

No more crying, wipe them tears

Daddy's here, no more nightmares

We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it

Laney uncles crazy, aint he?

Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world

When it spins, when it swirls

When it whirls, when it twirls

Two little beautiful girls

Lookin' puzzled, in a daze

I know it's confusing you

Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems

The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me

All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see

Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me

But things have gotten so bad between us

I don't see us ever being together ever again

Like we used to be when we was teenagers

But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be

But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is

But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep

Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream



Now hush little baby, don't you cry

Everything's gonna be alright

Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya

Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why

We feel how we feel inside

It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby

But I promise momma's gon' be alright



It's funny

I remember back one year when daddy had no money

Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up

And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me

Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em

I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job

But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom

And at the time every house that we lived in

Either kept getting broken into and robbed

Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar

Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college

Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it

And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart

And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back

On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment

And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara

And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre

And flew you and momma out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me

Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it

And you and Laney were to young to understand it

Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit

And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it

I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud

Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing

Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out

To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here

Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here

I like the sound of that, yeah

It's got a ring to it don't it?

Shh, momma's only gone for the moment



Now hush little baby, don't you cry

Everything's gonna be alright

Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya

Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why

We feel how we feel inside

It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby

But I promise momma's gon' be alright



And if you ask me too

Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird

I'mma give you the world

I'mma buy a diamond ring for you

I'mma sing for you

I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine

I'mma break that birdies neck

I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya

And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (haha)"

You just make me get so crazy.

I go skitzo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic

One minute I want to slit your throat

The next I want sex.

You make me crazy, 

the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sac

We fuck like 2 jackrabbits

And maybe that's a bad habit.

Cuz the next day we're right back at it

In the same exact pattern

What the fuck is the matter with us

We can't figure out if it's

Lust or it's love

What's sad is what's attracting us to each other

They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.

Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch

But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today

But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you

Just cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you.

But if there's one thing about you I admire its, baby,

Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am

Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes

But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.

Like a devil in disguise,

You're always full of surprises

Always pullin' devises

Out your personal vibrators and dildos

You fucked yourself so much

You barely feel those anymore

You're only 24 but you're plenty more mature

Than those other little hoes

Who just act like little girls

Like they're in middle school still

You're crazy sexy cool, chillin

You play your position

You never step out of line

Even though I stay in your business

You've always kept out of mine.

I wonder whats on your mind

Sometimes they say love is blind

Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye

You ain't see a sign.



[with Chorus]

Or maybe you did Maybe you like being shoved

Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove



[Chorus]

Crazy on you

Crazy on you

Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu



[Verse 2]



You're the ink to my paper

Where my pen is to my pad

The moral, the very fiber

The whole substance to my rap.

You are my reason for being

The meaning of my existence

If it wasn't for you

I would never be able to spit this

As intence I do and the irony

Is you rely on me as much 

as I rely on you to inspire me like you do.

You provide me the lighter fluid to fuel my fire

You're my entire supply

Gas, the match, the igniter.

The only way that I am able to stay so stable

Is you're the legs to my table

If you were to break I'd fall on my face.

But I'm always going to make you feel

I don't need you as much as I really need you

So you don't use it to your advantage.

But you're essential to me

You're the air I breathe

I believe if you ever leave me 

I'd probably have no reason to be.

You are the Kim to my Marshall 

You're the Slim to my Shady

The Dre to my Eminem

The Elaina to my Hailey.

You are the word I am looking for when 

I'm trying to describe how I feel inside

And the right one just won't come to my mind.

You're like the pillar that props me up

The beam that supports me

The bitch who never took half, 

The wife who never divorced me.

You're like the root to my evil

You let my devil come out me

You let me beat the shit out you

Before you beat the shit out me.



[with Chorus]



And no matter how much

Too much is never enough

Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove



[Chorus]

I'm crazy on you

Crazy on you

Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu"

[Intro]
I told ya'll mothafuckas I was comin back
What now nigga what now what
You's the projects nigga



[Chorus- Eminem]

One shot two shot three shots four shots

All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops

Bodies drop hit the floor music's off

Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off



[Verse 1- Bizarre]

You bitches is gone I'm dropped in the club

And I'm tryna run and get my mothafuckin gun

(Nigga what about your wife)

Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my mothafuckin life

Oh shit, the shooter's comin'

Bitches, hoes niggas is runnin

People shot all over the floor

And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door

Thats the sound of the glock

Even DJ House fucked around and got shot

I done messed around and forgot my tec

I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex



[Verse 2- Kuniva]

(Kuniva you aight)

These niggas is trippin'

(Where's Bizarre at?)

I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at

Bitches screamin everywhere and niggas is wildin'

Two minutes ago we was all jokin and smilin

This chick is clingin onto me sobbin and sighin

Sayin she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin

But it's real and it's on and cats is gettin killed

So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield

And she got hit now she yellin

(Don't leave me!)

I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me

I squeezed through the back door and made my escape

I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late



[Chorus- Eminem]

One shot two shot three shots four shots

All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops

Bodies drop hit the floor music's off

Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off



[Verse 3- Swifty]

(Nigga I been tryna call you all day mothafucka where you at?)

I'm on seven mile what the fuck was that

Damn somebody hit me from the back

(With they car?)

With a gat nigga and my tire is flat

And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes

(Is you hit?)

Iono but I can tell you what they drove

It was a black Mitsubishi

(Shit thats the clique we beefin wit I swear)

Man and I was on my way there

Believe me I'm leavin a carcus today 

I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way

I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tuck

I'ma meet you at the club we gon' fuck these hoes up



[Chorus- Eminem]

One shot two shot three shots four shots

All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops

Bodies drop hit the floor music's off

Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off



[Verse 4- Eminem]

I never seen no shit like this is my life before

People are still camped out from the night before

Sleepin outside the door waitin in line

Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform

The fire marshalls no, the venue's too small

People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd vans

And some cum wad from out the parkin lot

Get into an argument over a parkin spot

He decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off

Missed who he's aimin for six feet away's the door

In St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin all over the place

Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall

Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off

I'm posted up by the bar havin a Mozeltoff 

Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off

Thank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun

And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him

Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre

Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was

I never saw him run so fast in my life

Look at him haulin ass I think he left his wife

There she is on the ground bein trampled

I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her

God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit

My vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin

If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop Dee

Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it

And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps

Looked up and I seen Swift shootin it out

But I can't see who he's shootin it out with

But Denaun's right behind him squeezin his four fifth



[Chorus- Eminem]

One shot two shot three shots four shots

All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops

Bodies drop hit the floor music's off

Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off



[Verse 5- Kon Artis]

It's Friday night came to this bitch right

Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right

I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight

Although I can't stay here to fight cuz I'm poppin niggas tonight

Thats right bitches I'm drunk with revenge

Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in

Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucka

Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this mothafucka

So one shot for the money two's to stop the show

Third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go

(I just wanna know who's drivin a black Mitsubishi)

He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece



[Chorus- Eminem]

One shot two shot three shots four shots

All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops

Bodies drop hit the floor music's off

Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off"

I scream for police

but I doubt

They're gonna hear me

when I shout

A couple of cocktails will send me to jail

there's a couple of cops hot on my trail

But this time, when I get pulled over

there's a doberman pinscher and a pitbull in the seat

these pigs 'll get bit fooling with me

quit fooling with me

Bitch, you're gonna see

No pistol in the seat

why it always gotta be an issue when you're me

and which you're gonna see in the long run

Im'a be the wrong one

you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass

flashin that flash-light on my ass where was you at

But I've innested

Now I got the Industry pissy

eversince me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny

We got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty

Fuck money I don't rap for dead presidents

I'd rather see the president dead

It's never been said 

but I said precedents and the standards

and they can't stand it

My name should've been bastard

the shit should've been plastered

on my forehead with a stamp

I should've been blasted

I should've been had a cap pulled in my ass

but I'm too swift and fast 

for that, I'm past it 

I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot

Fuck that shit

I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis

under my Long Johns 

under my Sean Johns

when running with the long arm or the long long gone

Im'a do five years or less than that

no questions asked

it might be a good idea to stop right here

and quit while I'm ahead

already in the red

already got a steady infrared nipped on my head

A target on my back

bigger problems than that

Bin Laden on my ass

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me

I know it's sad but it's making me happy

The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on

Because you love me and I love you more



[verse 1]

It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit

We say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us

It's lust, 'cuz neither one of us trusts each other so we fuck

'till we bust, 'till cuss each other out, we know what it's about

Shout 'till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house

I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth, we fist fight

'till we turn this mother out and apologize after, laughter

Pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again

And it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you

There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do 'cuz



[chorus]

The more you put me through

The more it makes me wanna come back to you

You say you hate me, I just love you more

You don't want me, I just want you more

I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me

I know it's sad but it's making me happy

The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on

Because you love me and I love you more



[verse 2]

'Cuz I hate you, do you hate me? 

Good, 'cuz you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry

It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you

on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you

You FUCK other people and I FUCK other people

You're a SLUT, but i'm equal, i'm a MUTT, we're both evilin our ways 

but neither one of us would ever admit it

'Cuz one of us would have one up on the other so forget it

We can make accusations, people spread rumours

But they ain't got proof, 'till they do, it's just the two of us

You and me, 'cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me

But you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed

If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin', yeah I would 

'Cuz the sex is too damn good, if I ran, who would I run to

that would be this soft and warm? So it's off and on

Usually more off then on but at least we know that we

Share this common bond, you're the only one I can fuck

without a condom on, I hope the only reason that I cope

Is 'cuz of that fact and I can bust in that, and that's why



[chorus]

The more you put me through

The more it makes me wanna come back to you

You say you hate me, I just love you more

You don't want me, I just want you more

I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me

I know it's sad but it's making me happy

The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on

Because you love me and I love you more



[verse 3]

I can never understand it, that's why I don't try

From junior high until we both die, you silly hoe why must we try

Is it really so rough that we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff

Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs

We're lying to ourself, that's the beauty of it, yeah

'Cuz we truly love each other, that's why we always fight

And all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night

And it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this pinned up rage

We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged

By someone else, we both been someone else's someone else

The problem is neither one wants help, it's an addiction

And it can't be fixed, our family's mixed up

There's a baby sister in the mix and it hurts 'cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit

And anybody who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit

And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time on every song

Every lyric and every rhyme, all the hoopla, all of the woopty woo

What you put me through, fuckin' woopty do

But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love

You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up

This time, 'cuz this time girl i'm tellin you what

You do it again and i'm fuckin' you up 'cuz no matter 



[chorus 2]

What you say, what you do

I'ma hunt you down 'till I find you

No matter where you run, i'll be right there

Right behind you in your nightmares

So much for them flowers, and the candy

All the times that you threw it back at me

Told me you hate me, you 'gon hate me more

When you find out you can't escape me, whore



[chorus]

The more you put me through

The more it makes me wanna come back to you

You say you hate me, I just love you more

You don't want me, I just want you more

I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me

I know it's sad but it's making me happy

The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on

Because you love me and I love you more"

They should have never let us get off foot in this game...
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it

So they probaly told you go with the flow

Just so that I don't explode

And have another episode where I let it go as far as

The one with Benzino did I'm waitin for that next beef, 

I'm cocked, locked and loaded

I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas, 

My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fuckin pole vault with

Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated 

Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it

Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game

Cause they know that they don't spit the same

It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame

Everyday it's the same thing,

People in this game try to buddy buddy us

Just to get close enough to study us

Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that

They all tryin to get that stamp

They after that Shady - Aftermath money

It's like a monopoly

They probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully

50 Cent was like a fuckin jackpot for me 

And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery 

And a damn slot machine at the same time as eachother

Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers

When we rhyme with eachother 

In time we discovered that we have more in common 

Then we thought with eachother

Both robbed of our mothers

Our fathers ain't want us

What was wrong with us, was it our fault

Cause we started thinkin god doesn't love us

Two odd motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time

What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens

I still remember the call up in ??

Big L had just got popped just a month before

If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia

Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate

That's when he popped up a number one

And we ain't never gonna stop if you wond-erin

Even if I'm under the gun 

You ain't gotta agree all the time with me

Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I

But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 

Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual

Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all 

Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's

Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them

Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats

Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dogg was hollerin

'Fuck Compton'

I was whilin', freestylin back when they was still makin Maxell cassettes

I wasn't even raps Elvis yet 

That tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit

Ricky-Ticky-Toc-Ticky-Ticky-Toc

Still with the Diggy-Diggy-Doc-Diggy-Diggy-Doc

How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours? 

The stripes and the stars for the rights of men who have died for the protect?

The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedem of speech the United States Government has sworn to uphold





Yo, I want everyone to listen to the words of this song 



Or so we're told... 



Verse #1

I never woulda dreamed in a million years id see 

so many mutha fuckin people who feel like me 

Who share the same views 

And the same exact beliefs 

Its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me 

So many lives i touched 

So much anger aimed at no perticular direction 

Just sprays and sprays 

Straight through your radio wavs 

It plays and plays 

Till it stays stuck in your head 

For days and days 

who woulda thought standin in this mirror 

Bleachin my hair wit some Peroxide 

Reachin for a T shirt to wear 

That i would catipult to the fore-front of rap like this 

How can i predict my words 

And have an impact like this 

I musta struck a chord wit somebody up in the office 

Cuz congress keeps tellin me 

I aint causin nuttin but problems 

And now they sayin im in trouble wit the government 

Im lovin it

I shovelled shit all my life 

And now im dumpin it on

I could be one of ur kids 

WHITE AMERICA 

Little erik looks just like this 

WHITE AMERICA 

Erica loves my shit 

I got to TRL 

Look how many hugs i get 



Verse #2

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like urself 

If they were brown 

Shady knew shady sits on the shelf 

But Shadys cute 

Shady knew Shady's dimples would help 

Make ladies swoon baby 

(ooo baby) 

Look at myself! 

Lets do the math 

If i was black i woulda sold half 

I aint have to graduate 

From Lincoln High School to know that 

But i can rap so fuck school 

Im too cool to go back 

Gimme the mic 

Show me where the fuckin studio's at 

When i was underground 

No one gave a fuck i was white 

No lables wanted to sign me 

Almost gave up, i was like ""Fuck it"" 

Until i met Dre 

The only one who looked past 

Gave me a chance 

And i lit a fire up under his ass 

Helped him get back to the top 

Every fan black that i got 

Was probly his 

In exchange for every white fan that he's got 

Like damn we just swapped 

Sittin back look at this shit wow 

Im like ""Does this skin work for my benifit now?"" 



Chorus 



Verse #3

See the problem is i speak to suberban kids 

Who otherwise 

Woulda never knew these words exist 

These moms probly woulda never gave 2 squirts of piss

Till i created so much mutha fuckin turbulence

Straight out the tube right into ya livin rooms i came 

And kids Flipped

When they found out i was produced by Dre 

Thats all it took 

And they were instantly hooked right in 

And they connected wit me too cuz i looked like them

Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope 

Searchin wit a fine toothed comb 

Its like this rope waitin to choke 

Tightenin around my throat 

Watchin me while i write this like ""I dont like this, NO!"" 

All i hear is 

Lyrics lyrics constant controversy 

Sponsors workin round the clock 

To try to stop my concerts early 

Surely hip hop is never a problem 

In Harlem only In Boston 

After it bothered ya fathers 

of daughters startin to blossom 

Now im catchin the flack from these activists 

When they raggin 

Actin like im the 1st rapper to smack a bitch and say faggot 

Shit 

Just look at me like im ya closest pal 

A poster child 

the mutha fuckin spokesman now!

Outro

So to the parents of America

I am the damager aimed at little Erica

To attack her character

The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns

Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress

And piss on the lawns of the whitehouse

To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker

To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hipocracy

Fuck you Ms Cheeney

Fuck you Tipper Gore

Fuck you with the free-este of space this divided state of embarrasment will allow me to have

Fuck You

Let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

Let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)



Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles

Gee willikers Dre, ""Holy bat syllables!""

Look at all the bullshit that goes on

In Gotham when I'm gone

Time to get rid of these rap criminals

So skip to your lou while I do what I do best

You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it

Flows too wet, nobody close to it

Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit

The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much

They make it all up, there's no such thing

Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans

It just means so much more to so much more

People when you're rappin' and you know what for

The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all

To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!



Now let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

Let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)



It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo

Two old friends, why panic? You already know

Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes

Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero

You can even call collect, the most feared duet

Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette

And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat

People steppin' over people just to rush to the set

Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely

Ease over these beats and be so breezy

Jesus, how can shit be so easy?

How can one Chandra be so Levy?

Turn on these beats, MC's don't see me

Believe me, BET and MTV

Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy

Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me

'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear

Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here

But we ain't fuckin' around round here

Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a ""hell yeah""? (Hell yeah!)



Now let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

Let's get down to business

I don't got no time to play around, what is this?

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)



So there you have it, folks

(Marshall!) has come to save the day

Back with his friend Andre

Here to remind you that bullshit does not pay

Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay

And never go away, until our dying day

Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)

So until next time, friends

Same blonde hair, same rap channel

Good night, everyone! Thank you for coming!

Your host for the evening (Marshall!)

Oh! Heh"

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,

give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the

evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but

they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,

i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...



[CHORUS]



I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm

cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I

never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...



I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me

inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a

multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father

must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,

no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I

couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it

work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm

man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest

shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot

Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...



[CHORUS]



Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you

think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'

your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'

through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of

Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew

up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made

that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your

gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna

know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but

you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't

admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare

you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in

hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess

what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

Never been too type to bend or budge

The wrong button to push, no friend, no bush

I'm the centerpiece, you're a mortice, i'm a pitbull off his leash

All this peace-talkin cease

All these people i had to leave in limbo

I'm back now and i've come to release this info

I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple

Cannabitch, don't want no beef with slim, NOO!

Not even on my radar

So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off

and follow me cos i put these crayons to chaos

from seance to seance. 



Chorus 2x:

So come on down

So get on down

Doh si doh now

Dont have a good plan

Dont be scerrrd (scared), cuz therrr (there) ain't nuttin' to werrr (worry) 'bout

Let your hair down

Verse #2:

Let your hair down to the track, yeh, keep goin back (BOO!)

The boogie-monster of rap, yeh, the man's back!

With a plan to ambush this bush administration

Moosh the senate's facin', push this generation

O' kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'

You might not like, this white hot light that im under

No wonder i look so sunburnt,

Oh no, i won't leave no stone unturned

Oh no, i won't leave one goin' nowhere

Doh-si-soh oh! yo! ho! hello there!

Oh yeh! don't think i won't go there

Go to beyreuth and do a show there

Yeh you laugh til your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted

When you're in bed here thinkin' the draft cant happen

'Til you fuck around gettin anthrax napkin

Inside a package wrapped in sarandrap wrappin'

Open the plastic, and then you stand back gaspin'

Fuckin' assassins hijackin' anthrax crashin'

All this terror, america demands action

Next thing you know, you've got uncle sam's ass askin'

To join our army, or what you do for their navy

You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18

You're on a plane now eatin' that food and that baked beans

I'm 28, they gon take you 'fore they take me

Crazy insane or insane crazy?

When i say hussein, you say shady!

Rain 2 days late, the date's today

Hey team! 



Chorus 2x:





Verse #3

Nothing moves me more than a groove that suits me

Nothing suits me more than a groove that boosts me

Nothing boosts me more or suites me beautifully

There's nothing you can do to me, stab me, shoot me

Physcotic hypnotic product I gotta take antibotic

Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada

Gotta talk alot of hum-hei-la-da-da-der

Oochie walla-walla-mmm-de-da-da but you gotta gotta

Keep moving there's more music to make

Keep making new shit, produce hits to break

The monotony whats gotten into me?

Drugs, rock and hennesey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies

On your knees, got you under siege

Somebody you would give a lung to be

Hungry like a fucking younger me

Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free

To have you killed by somebody who has nothing

Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns, 
never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one,
and got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin', 
took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin', 

willin' to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant life or death, 

never live to regret what I said, 

when you're me, people just want to see, 

if it's true, if it's you, what you say in your rap's, what you do, 

so they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill, 

when they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real, 

in confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation, 

any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it, 

if you conceal it, reveal it, being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, 

pull it, squeeze it, till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies, 

I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze...



[Chorus:]

I'm a soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much, they won't budge, 

i'll never fall or fold up,

i'm a soldier, 

even if my collar bone's crush or crumble, 

I will never slip or stumble, 

i'm a soldier, 

these shoulder's hold up so much, they won't budge, 

i'll never fall or fold up, 

i'm a soldier, 

even if my collar bone's crush or crumble, 

I will never stumble...



I love pissin' you off, it get's me off, 

like my lawyer's, when the fuckin' judge let's me off,

all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off, 

i'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bet's be off, 

i'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitche, it's news, 

pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers, six-two, 

who needs bullets, soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets, 

an excellent method to get rid of the next bully, 

it's actually better cause instead you murderin', 

you can hurt em' and come back again and kick dirt at 'em, 

it's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued, 

you can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room, 

everybody halts and stops, calls the cops,

all you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops, 

runnin' and duckin' out the Hard Rocks parking lot, 

you'll all get shot whether its your fault or not, cause...



[Chorus]



I spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin' to 'em, 

give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em, 

i'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence, 

I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it, 

you motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it, 

don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it, 

don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest, 

I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch, 

so ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock, 

listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock, 

listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen, 

motherfuckers know that i'll never be Marshall again, 

full of controversy until I retire my jersey, 

'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty, and

Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me, 

and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, i'm a...

{Hollywood}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

{Why do I feel this way}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood



[Verse 1]

I thought I had it all figured out, I did

I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim

But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once

I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs

Which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave

How come I couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me

Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt

Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell, to catch me

The minute shit was heated she just bailed

i'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself

I couldn't even see the millimetere when it fell

Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt

Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground

I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail

I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female

I need to slow down

Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now i'm...



[CHORUS]



[Verse 2]

Bury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look

At nothin', this world's too much

I've swallowed all I could

If I could swallow a bottle of tylenol I would, and end it for good

Just say goodbye to Hollywood

I probably should, these problems are piling all at once

Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up

I think i'm bottomin' out

But i'm not about to give up, I gotta get up

Thank God, I got a little girl

And I'm a responsible father

So not a lot of good, i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud

Must be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it

All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps of my dad

Cause I hate him so bad

The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man

If you could understand why I am the way that I am

What do I say to my fans, when I tell 'em i'm...



[CHORUS]



[Verse 3]

I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it

For me to have this much appeal like this is sick

This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick

Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick

Fuck the guns, i'm done, i'll never look at gats

If I scrap, i'll scrap like I ain't never whooped some ass

I love my fans

But no one ever puts a grasp on the fact i've sacrificed everything I have

I never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at, this is whack

This is more than I ever could of asked

everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask

What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that

It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, i'm trapped

If I could go back, I never woulda rapped

I sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back

I just wanna leave this game with level head intact

Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein',

everything blow up and all you did was just grow

up emceeing

It's fuckin' crazy

Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had

But instead I forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin'...



[CHORUS]



[Outro]

Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood, {Goodbye},

please don't cry for me, when i'm gone for good, {this shit is not for me},

so goodbye, goodbye Hollywood,

{i'm not a fuckin' star}, please don't cry

for me, when I'm gone for good, {i'm goin' back home}..."

up the figure while my shit getting bigger, debatin' on a fuck or do I want to be her nigga,

to buyin', I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory, like takin' hoe's money, but that's

another story, for surely, the pussy on toast after we toast, her clothes fell like bishop in

hottest block, don't stop, the response I got when I was knockin' it, clock steady tickin',

kinky finger lickin', and can on, semen's at my tip when she moans, I gotta slow down before I

cum soon, and work that nigga, like a slave owner, when I dropped off my outfit, she knew I

wanted to bone her, she foamin' at the lips, the one between them hips, pubic hairs lookin' like

some sour cream dip, without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though, pussy tighter than

conditions of us black folks, we in the final stretch, the last part of sex, I bust a fat ass

nut, then I woke up next, like what the fuck is goin' on here, this bitch evaporated, pussy and

all, just picked up and vacated, now i'm frusturated cause my dick was unprotected, and Doctor

Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit...

before she get's kicked in the stomach, and she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me

to throw her off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force and I don't wanna resort to

any violence of any sort, but what's she shovin' me for, doesn't she love me no more, wasn't she

huggin' me four minutes ago at the door, man, i'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this

whore, what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce, she's havin' another baby

in a month, and it's yours, and you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visitin' someone

else, and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back, to Michigan, now the

plot is thickenin' worse, cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a

hearse, so you paranoid at every little cold that you get, ever since they told you this shit,

you've been holdin' your dick, so you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it, then

it's AIDS, he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it, so you jet back home, cause you

gon' get that hoe, when you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo', cause you love

her, you never would expect that blow, Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low,

I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to

See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver

Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker

Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital

By the doctor when I'm not co-operating

When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)

You waited this long, now stop debating

‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating

I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney

But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be

Or let me be me, so let me see

They try to shut me down on MTV

But it feels so empty without me

So, come on and dip, bum on your lips

Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious

Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis

They start feeling like prisoners helpless

'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!!!""

A visionary, vision is scary

Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves

A rebel, so just let me revel and bask

In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​

And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe

For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?

Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna

Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter

The center of attention, back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling

Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting

Testing, attention please

Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me

Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free

A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?



Now this looks like a job for me

Anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""

Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie

You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!

You don't know me, you're too old, let go

It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal

I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults

I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems

Everybody only wants to discuss me

So this must mean I'm disgusting

But it's just me, I'm just obscene

No, I'm not the first king of controversy

I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley

To do black music so selfishly

And use it to get myself wealthy

(Heyyy!) There's a concept that works

Twenty million other white rappers emerge

But no matter how many fish in the sea

It'll be so empty without me



Now this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me!

‘Cause we need a little controversy

‘Cause it feels so empty without me

Listen, Joel just called me and he said you're in the fucking back behind his studio,
shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range.
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around, like an idiot, outside of your home.
You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
Don't bring your gun outside of your home you can't carry it on you.

Leave your fuckin gun at home"
3CpoeW0cZSDzIRv5z34F87,Sing For The Moment,2cWBwpqMsDJC1ZUwz813lo,The Eminem Show,7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR,Eminem,339546,,2002,"These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care

He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out

When he talks about, his fucking dad walking out

Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out

If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out

His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back

Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stocking cap

His step-father hit him so he socked him back

And broke his nose, his house is a broken home

There's no control, he just lets his emotions go



Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)

Sing it with me, just for today

Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away



Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters

In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum

Holy or unholy, only have one homie

Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate

I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great

Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate

It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum

Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?

From standing on corners and porches just rapping

To having a fortune, no more kissing ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you

Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you

To get they hands on every dime you have

They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon

Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns

That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me

Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

But all their kids been listening to me religiously

So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me

They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me

If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal

Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?

I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to

You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you



Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing this shit!)

Sing it with me, just for today

Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away



They say music can alter moods and talk to you

Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?

Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude

Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols

And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool

Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves

We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales

You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self

We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail

It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing

To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted

That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing

Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine

Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long

Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs

Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives

So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die

'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe

We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes

That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it

Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden

And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone

Just let our spirits live on

Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can



Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)

Sing it with me, just for today

Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)

Sing it with me, just for today

Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away"

I'd never let another chick bring me down

In a relationship; save it, bitch!

Babysit? You make me sick

Superman ain't savin' shit

Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase

I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face

Play no games, say no names

Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face

I'm a different man, kiss my ass

Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?

Kiss my dick, get my cash?

I'd rather have you whip my ass

Don't put out, I'll put you out

Won't get out, I'll push you out

We'll be friends, I'll call you again

I'll chase you around every bar you attend

Never know what kinda car I be in

We'll see how much you be partyin' then

You don't want that, neither do I

I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys

Too much pride, between you and I

Not a jealous man, but females lie

But I guess that's just what sluts do

How could it ever be just us two?

I'd never love you enough to trust you

We just met and I just fucked you

I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back

Yo, check it out



Some days I sit starin' out the window

Watchin' this world pass me by

Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for

I almost break down and cry

Sometimes I think I'm crazy

I'm crazy? Oh, so crazy

Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?

But then I see my baby

Suddenly I'm not crazy

It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no



Cause sometimes it feels

Like the world's on my shoulders

Everyone's leanin' on me

Cause sometimes it feels

Like the world's almost over

But then she comes back to me



My baby girl keeps gettin' older

I watch her grow up with pride

People make jokes cause they don't understand me

They just don't see my real side

I act like shit don't faze me

Inside it drives me crazy

My insecurities could eat me alive

But then I see my baby

Suddenly I'm not crazy

It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no



Cause sometimes it feels

Like the world's on my shoulders

Everyone's leanin' on me

Cause sometimes it feels

Like the world's almost over

But then she comes back to me



Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter

If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father

To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her

God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *want her*

Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona

That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his mama

But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest

Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled

That hurts deep inside of my soul

And just know that I grow colder the older I grow

This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold

And this load is like the weight of the world

And I think my neck is breakin'

Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?

Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself

But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell

But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt

So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else

But the years that I've wasted

Is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted

So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation

I've went to jail for this woman

I've been to bat for this woman

I've taken bats to people's backs

Bent over backwards for this woman

Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?

Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up

If I'd have seen what she was fuckin', but fuck it

It's over, there's no more reason to cry no more

I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie

So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya

Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner

And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted

It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted



And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders

Everyone's leanin' on me

Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier

Nothin' can take her from me



Wooo! Told you I can't sing

Oh well, I tried

Hailie, remember when I said

If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?

Guess what, Daddy's here

And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby

I love you (??*smooch*)??"

But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Sike!
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love

Or would it matter

Can never be the lead-off batter of things

Shit for me to feed off

I'm see-saw battlin

But theres way too much at stake for me to be fake

There's too much on my plate

And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away

And not say what I got to say

What the fuck you take me for? a joke? you smokin crack?

Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back

I get up 'for i get down, run myself in the ground, 'for I put some wack shit out

I'm tryin-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark

Ya'll steady tryin to drown the shark

Ain't gonna do nothin but piss me off

Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off

See me leap out, pull the piece out, fuck shootin i'm just trying to knock his teeth out

Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle

Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap

Yo slim, you gonna let him get away with that?

He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that

Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,

This is crazy the way we act

When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops



There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh

If so you woulda tried

The only way I'm leavin this bitch is suicide

I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with hennesy,

Got drunk then I finished he

I'm every nigga's favorite arch-enemy.

Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef

I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark dilligently

I'm not what you think

I appear to be fucked up

Mentally endangered

I can't stay away from a razor

I just want my face in a paper

I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres

I murder you

Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of sam, bitch, I'm surgical

I'l allergic to dyin, you think not? you got balls? We can see how large

When the music stops



I was happy having a deal at first,

Thought money would make me happy but

It only made my pain worst,

It hurts when u see ur friends turn their back on u dawg

When u ain't got nothing left but ur word and ur balls

And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends

Beggin' with they hands out

Checking for ur record when its selling

When it aint, that's the end, no laughs

No friends no girl

Just the gin u drink till u car spin u then

[Screech]

Damn!

[Crash]

U slam into the wall and u fall

Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm

About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol

If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops



Let's see how many of your men loyal,

When i pull up looking for you,

With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil

I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust ur head would just explode

With red stuff i'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon

Braggin about how u shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you

Niggars, if i was u niggas, i'll run while given the chance

Understand i can enchance the spirit of man

Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really

Irks me, u ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk

Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark

Hug the floor while we plan to the war with ur life, fuck the tour and the mic

I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like

You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga ur a gonna at night



When The Music Stops



Instigators, turn pits in cages

Let loose and bit the neighbours

wrist to razors

Ya'll don't want war, you want talk

In the dark my dogs all bark like woof

Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof

Caved in like reindeer hoofs

Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose

The more ya'll breach, the more I moves

This hill street, this is hardcore blues

Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)

Or make the news betcha all ya'll move

When the uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop



Music's changed my life in so many ways

Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade

LL told me to rock the bells

NWA said fuck the police

Now i'm in jail

93 was strictly R&B

Fucked up hair cut

Listen to Jodeci

Michael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike

Ass cheeks painted white

Fucking Presilla at night

Flying down sunset smoking crack

Transvestite in the front

Eddi Murphy in the back

MOP had me grindy and griddy

Marilyn Manson, i dyed my hair blue

And grew some titties

Ludacris told me to throw them bowls

Now i'm in the hospital

Broken nose and a fractured elbow

Voices in my head, i'm going in shock,

I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops

Yo Dre, we ridin?

Whatever



[Eminem]

Well I'm witchu homie



[Dr. Dre]

Ok, Let's handle this small shit



[Eminem]

I was born to brew up storms 'n stir up shit

Kick up dust, cuss til I slur up spit

Grew up too quick, won't through too much, through too much shit

Corrupt and I'm pour it on like syrup, bitch

Thick in gritz, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth

Dre tole me to milk this shit for what it's worth

Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth

And if I fumble the verse, keep going

First take, I make mistakes, just keep it

No punches, pull no punches, that's weak shit

Fake shit if I ever take shit, I eat shit

Wasn't for him? I wouldn't be shit



[Dr. Dre]

Creep wit me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane

Been here longer than anyone in the game

And I ain't got to lie about my age



[Eminem]

But what about Jermaine?



[Dr. Dre]

Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin mine or Timbaland's name

And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your sayin

I'ma giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked

When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it

Ya midget, Mini-Me, with a buncha little Mini-You's

Runnin around your backyard swimming pools

Over 80 million records sold

And I ain't had to do it with 10 or 11 year olds



[Chorus:]

Cuz what you say is what you say

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?



Cuz what you say is what you say

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?



[Eminem]

Second verse, it gets worst

It gets no better than this

Amatuers drink veteran piss

From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up

Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri

Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you

Blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucken again

Dre ain't havin it as long as Im here, play Devil's Advocate



[Dr. Dre]

If there was some magic shit I could wave

Over the indusrty that could save it when I'm gone

And bury to make sure the tradition carries on

I would



[Eminem]

If I could only use this power for good

I wouldn't, not even if I could



[Dr. Dre]

From the hood and I'm a hornet

And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered



[Eminem]

And I'ma only sucker punch or swing without warnin

And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off

Cuz I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off

Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk

Don't give a fuck, white Pac, so much spunk

When I was little I knew I would blow up

And sell a mil or grow up to be a tiller

Go nuts and be a killer



[Dr. Dre]

And I'm somethin of a phenom

One puff of the chron

I'm unstoppable, I'm alive, I'm on top again

There's no obstacle that I can't conquer

So come along with us (Come On)



[Chorus:]

Cuz what you say is what you say

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?



Cuz what you say is what you say

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?



[Dr. Dre]

Now anybody who knows Dre

Knows I'm about fast cars and alize, partyin all day

But I handle my business cuz it's work before play

Don't look for trouble but I serve you gourmet

However you want it, you could have it your way

You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day

Bullet with your name, sendin it your way

That goes for anyone who walks thru that doorway

Cuz this is my space, you invade it

Live to regret it and you die tryin to violate it

Fuck around and you'll get anahilated

Eyes diliated



[Eminem]

Ha, like my old lady

Cuz what you say is what you say

Sometimes what you mean is 2 different things

Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things

Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything

Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back

I speed write and my loose leaves my lanch pad



[Dr. Dre]

And I can pull any string

Don't have to prove anything

Catch a contract on your head

You headed West, talk shit about Dre?

You better get a vest, then invest in something

To protect your head and neck



[Eminem]

And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth

I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth

But a lot of truth is said injest

And if I ever do live to be a legend

I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source

Ain't holdin' my fuckin breath

But I suffocate for the respect

Fore I breath the collect the fuckin check



[Chorus:]

Cuz what you say is what you say

4xkOaSrkexMciUUogZKVTS,Till I Collapse,2cWBwpqMsDJC1ZUwz813lo,The Eminem Show,7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR,"Eminem, Nate Dogg",297786,,2002,"Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, and gotta find that inner strength, and just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse

Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em

Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em

Cause when I am not, then I'mma stop penning 'em

And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem

Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?

Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom

Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop

Amoxicillin's just not real enough

The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain

A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners

You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it

Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us

You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock

Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?

Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up

You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck



Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse



Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get

When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit

This is your moment, and every single minute you spend

Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again

So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can

And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end

Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in

I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in

It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie

Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me

But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy

So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me

That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me

Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me

You hate it but you know respect you got to give me

The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me



Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse



Soon as a verse starts I eat at an emcee's heart

What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart

And it's absurd how people hang on every word

I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve

But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved

If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first

Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse

That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse

My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict

I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers

But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles

The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers

So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em

The track is on some battling raps, who want some static?

Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters

A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

So...



Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse



Until the roof (until the roof)

The roof comes off (the roof comes off)

Until my legs (until my legs)

Give out from (underneath me)

I will not fall, I will stand tall

Feels like no one can beat me"

""Daddy, what are you doing?""
Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
I'm going to Hell! Who's coming with me?
Somebody, please help him!

I think my dad's gone crazy!



There's no mountain I can't climb

There's no tower too high

No plane that I can't learn how to fly

What do I gotta do to get through to you

To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?

(Rahhnnn!)

Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls

I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar

Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses

With Elton John's name on my drag wall

I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off

All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off

(Suck it, Marshall!)

So tell Laura and her husband to back off

'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off

And launch one at these Russians, and that's all

Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off

When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?

{*knocking*} Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)



There's really nothin' else to say, I can't explain it

I think my dad's gone crazy!

A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, baby?

I think my dad's gone crazy!

There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me

I think my dad's gone crazy!

There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie

I think my dad's gone crazy!



It's like my mother always told me

Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine

And goddamn it, you little motherfucker

If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!

 Uh Fuck that shit, bitch!

Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick

And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second

I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record

I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch

Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face, with a clit

Ring in my nose than quit bringin' my flows

Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?

If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.

I wouldn't have to go eenee-meene-minie-moe

Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more

Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more? (Dad!)



There's really nothin' else to say

There's nothin' you could do or say

That could ever change me

I think my dad's gone crazy!

There's no one on Earth that can save me

Not even Hailie

I think my dad's gone crazy!



My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise

At the same time, can make you dry your eyes

With the same rhyme

See, what you're seein' is a genius at work

Which to me isn't work

So it's easy to misinterpret it at first

Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek

I'd yank my fuckin' teeth

Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums

Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once

And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son

And walk around the rest of my life spit on

And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung

Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on

More pain inside of my brain

Than the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane

Aimed at the World Trade

Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky

'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade

And that's pretty much the gist of it

The parents are pissed, but the kids love it

9 millimeter heaters stashed

In two-seaters with meat cleavers

I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither



There's really nothin' else to say

I can't explain it

I think my dad's gone crazy!

A little help from Hailie Jade

Won't you tell 'em, baby?

Okay children quiet down, quiet down
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please

Brian don't throw that (SHUT UP!)

Mr. Shady will be your new substitute 

while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (HE'S GOT AIDS!)

Good luck Mr. Shady



[Eminem]

Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!)

Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels

But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)

Say hi Bob! (""Hi Bob"") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom

and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot

but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot

and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock

when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog

Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!)

And even if they escaped and they got the cops

the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge

'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job

when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk

But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off

But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker

Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka

You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a ""Dr.""

He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her

and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her

But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander

they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner

And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 

and what it might do to you

So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you 



Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)



See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon)

and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man)

and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right)

She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)

So kids say no to drugs (that's right)

So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)

Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)

Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?



[Eminem]

My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 

FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)

Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?

Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world

If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it

Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid

and spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back

So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back

Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 

After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold

and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys

and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive

and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*} 

His back starts tah - look like the McDonald's Arches

He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*BLEH*}

And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him

""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!""

cause they took it too, so they think it's funny

So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money

Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over

and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga

And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac

So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you



Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)



See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right)

and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right)

and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can)

She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)

So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)

So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)

And there's really nothin else to say (but umm)

Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?



[Eminem]

And last but not least, one of the most humungous

problems among young people today, is fungus

It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 

bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it

Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff

And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..

And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)

Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair

(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire

Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)

And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms

Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus

Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?)

cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!!)

See drugs are bad, it's a common fact

But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)

But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.

They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee

and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault

So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 

cause I'm bad for you



Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)



See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh)

and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down)

and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask)

She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)

So kids say no to drugs (say no)

So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)

And there's really nothin else to say (that's right)

Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?



[Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman)

Come on children, clap along (SHUT UP!)

Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!)

Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)

So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin penis!)

so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)

(Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!)

When I was just a little baby boy,
my momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
she used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older

and I realized, she was the crazy one

But there was nothin I could do or say to try to change it

cause that's just the way she was



They said I can't rap about bein broke no more

They say I can't rap about coke no more

(AHHH!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore

til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!

(AHHH!) These motherfuckers are thinkin I'm playin

Thinkin I'm sayin the shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin it

(AHHH!) Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you

I'ma pull +YOU+ to this bullet, and put it through you

(AHHH!) Shut up slut, you're causin too much chaos

Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?

""Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,

snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?""

You god damn right BITCH, and now it's too late

I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states

I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches

Girls leave - you ain't nuttin but a slut to me

Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef

We ain't gon' never stop beefin I don't squash the beef

You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead

for poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said

But when they kill me - I'm bringin the world with me

Bitches too! You ain't nuttin but a girl to me

I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (why?)

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you

in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you

Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!

I'm tryin to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em

I ain't ask to rap, but I rap on acid

Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added

WHOOPS! Is that a subliminal hint? NO!

Just criminal intent to sodomize women again

Eminem offend? NO! Eminem insult

And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse

to do it again, THEN, if he does it again

you'll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up on the 10th

(Ahhhhhhhh!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus

I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest

A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times

in a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?

Here we go again, we're out of our medicine

out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?

Cause lady's screams keep creepin in Shady's dreams

And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks

this eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE!

TWICE? Whatever, I hate these things

Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks

Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows

just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?

FUCK THAT! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer

from fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her

from principal to the study body and counselor

from in-school to before school to out of school

I don't even believe in breathin I'm leavin air in your lungs

just to hear you keep screamin for me to seep it

I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROATS ACHE

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin

I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom

I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em

There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em

but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?

My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father

If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?

I'ma name her Bonnie



I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry

I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him

I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan

I even got the underground shit that you did with Scam

I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man

I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was fat

Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,

just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan

This is Stan

Dear Slim, 

you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance

I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans

If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert

you didn't have to, 

but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew

That's my little brother man, 

he's only six years old

We waited in the blistering cold for you four hours 

and you just said, ""No.""

That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol

He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do



I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to

Remember when we met in Denver?

You said if I'd write you, you would write back

See, I'm just like you in a way; I never knew my father neither

He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're saying in your songs

So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on

Cause I don't really got shit else

So that shit helps when I'm depressed

I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest



Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds

It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me

See everything you say is real

And I respect you cause you tell it

My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7

But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, 

no one does

She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up

You gotta call me, man

I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan

P.S. We should be together too



My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why 

I got out of bed at all

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans

This'll be the last package I ever send your ass

It's been six months and still no word  I don't deserve it?

I know you got my last two letters

I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it

I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway



Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?

You know the song by Phil Collins ""In the Air of the Night"" 

about that guy who could've saved that other guy from drownin'

But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?

That's kinda how this is

You could've rescued me from drowning

Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy



And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call

I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall

I loved you, Slim, we could've been together  think about it!

You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it

I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me

See, Slim--shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk

Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk

But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see, I ain't like you

Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more

And then she'll die too

Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now

Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?



My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why 

I got out of bed at all

The morning rain clouds up my window

and I can't see at all

And even if I could it'll all be gray,

but your picture on my wall

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad



Dear, Stan, 

I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy

You said your girlfriend's pregnant now. How far along is she?

Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that

And here's an autograph for your brother

I wrote it on a Starter cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you

Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you

But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? 

I say that shit just clowning, dawg

Come on, how fucked up is you?



You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'

To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls

When you get down some

And what's this shit about us meant to be together?

That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other

I really think you and your girlfriend need each other

Or maybe you just need to treat her better

I hope you get to read this letter

I just hope it reaches you in time

Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you

But Stan, why are you so mad?

Try to understand that I do want you as a fan



I just don't want you to do some crazy shit; 

I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge

And had his girlfriend in the trunk

And she was pregnant with his kid

And in the car they found a tape

But they didn't say who it was to

Come to think about it, his name was

it was you, damn!"

I put wives at risk with a knife like this (AHHH!!)

Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now

I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out

Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out

put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?

Oh - you want me to watch my mouth, how?

Take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around?

Look - I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around

and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out

(Oh my God! Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up

You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?

{*ewwww*} Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts

Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up

Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor

Quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement

(The kids!) But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace

You shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents

Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big

I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid

I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist

I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin the guns in this country? (Hmm?)

I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London

And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie

where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi

I sees three little kids, up in the front row,

screamin ""Go,"" with their 17-year-old Uncle

I'm like, ""Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads

who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?""

And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear

What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?

(Hmm?) So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words

when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse

(""Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!"")

And fuck was the first word I ever learned

up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!)

So read up, about how I used to get beat up

peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months

My life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?)

Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike

So how much easier would life be

if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?



Chorus



[Eminem]

I never knew I.. knew I'd..

have a new house or a new car

A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are

I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?

Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)

Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves

Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)

How many retards'll listen to me

and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a

teach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?

""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!""

Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?

Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been

if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought

Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought

that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop

I just said it - I ain't know if you'd do it or not

Look who decided to show his face!

I hope you've had fun in the last 4 years.

(Look man, I apologise again for-)

For shooting me? ! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?

(Again, it was a mistake,)

(a terrible mist- are you wearing a bulletproof vest?)

And then you go and you do what?

Hide out? stay in Detroit from us 5 years while the music industry melts the fuck down? Do you know how many people lost their jobs because of your fuckin vacation?

(Well that's actually why I'm here, I was gonna, put out some new music and I wanted to play it for you, and get your opinion)

Do I really need to hear it?

Let me guess, another album about poor me, I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life, and I'm such a tortured artist. Let me make music about it and my tragic love life, am I on to something here?

(Come on man it's not like that yo-)

You know what? Just hand the fuckin thing over

I'm done talkin to you. Think you can just come and go as you please.

Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it 
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..



I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag

of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be

the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth

And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works

And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve

all this tension dispensin these sentences

Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest

and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..

but at least have the decency in you

to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 

in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter

to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..

I don't know you and no, 

I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing

I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think

I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..

No patience is in me and if you offend me 

I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air 

I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit

I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe

I'm tired of all you (of all you)..

I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me



Chorus: Eminem



And I am, whatever you say I am

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

In the paper, the news everyday I am

Radio won't even play my jam

Cause I am, whatever you say I am

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

In the paper, the news everyday I am

I don't know it's just the way I am



[Eminem]

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered

with all of this nonsense it's constant

And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -

- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""

And all of this controversy circles me

and it seems like the media immediately

points a finger at me (finger at me)..

So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie

or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up

when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up

with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too

When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school

and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin

Where were the parents at? And look where it's at

Middle America, now it's a tragedy

Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty

havin this happenin (this happenin)..

then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..

But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire 

to burn and it's burnin and I have returned



Chorus



[Eminem]

I'm so sick and tired of bein admired

that I wish that I would just die or get fired

and dropped from my label and stop with the fables

I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is..""

And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation

to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations

And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..

to deal with these cocky caucasians who think

I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 

with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 

the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..

What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in

The why, the who what when, the where, and the how

'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out

cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it 

I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get

But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom

without someone standin by it

No I won't sign your autograph

You can call me an asshole I'm glad

May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like ya never seen a white person before

Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door

And started whooping her ass worse than before

They first were divorce, throwin?her over furniture (Ahh!)

It's the return of the...""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding, 

he didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""

And Dr. Dre said...

Nothing you idiots! Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)



Feminist women love Eminem

""Slim Shady, I'm sick of him

Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what

Flipping the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though""

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose

But no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms

Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't

But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose



""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""

And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss

And that's the message that we deliver to little kids

And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they gonna know what intercourse is

By the time they hit fourth grade

They got the Discovery Channel don't they?

""We ain't nothing but mammals""

Well, some of us cannibals

Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes

Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope

But if you feel like I feel, I got the anecdote

Women wave your panty-hoes, sing the chorus and it goes



I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Please stand up, please stand up



Cuz I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Please stand up, please stand up



Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records

Well I do so ""Fuck him and fuck you too!""

You think I give a damn about a Grammy?

Half of you critics can't even stomach me let alone stand me

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""

Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here

So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears

Shit Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst

And hear them argue over who she gave head to first

You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV



""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""

I should download her audio on MP3 and show the whole world

how you gave Eminem VD

I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups

All you do is annoy me so I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me

Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me

Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me

And just might be the next best thing but not quite me!



I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Please stand up, please stand up



I'm like a head trip to listen to cuz I'm only giving you

Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room

The only difference is I got the balls to say it

In front of y'all and I don't gotta be frost or sugar coated at all

I just get on a mic and spit it and whether you like to admit it

I just shitted better than 90 percent of you rappers out there

Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums

It's funny cuz at the rate I'm going when I'm 30

I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting

Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens

And I'm jerkin?but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working



And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking

He could be working at Burger King spitting on your onion rings

Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming ""I don't give a fuck!""

With his windows down and his system up

So, will the real Shady please stand up?

And put one of those fingers on each hand up?

And be proud to be outta ya mind and outta control

And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?



I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Please stand up, please stand up



Cuz I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

I used to, get punched and bullied on my block

Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mail box

I used to give a, fuck, now I could give a fuckless

What do I think of success? It sucks too much press I'm stressed

Too much cess with agress too upset it's just too much mess

I guess I must just blew up quick, yes

Grew up quick, no, was raised right, whatever you say is wrong

Whatever I say is right

Became a commodity because I'm W H I

It's Ken Kaniff, on the internet

Trying to, lure your kids, wit him into bed

It's a, sick world we live in these days

Slim for pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!

Sheez you guys are so sensitive

Slim it's touchy subject try and just don't mention it

Mind with no sense in it, tried to get so frenetic

Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smokin 'em

Wit my windows tinted, wit nine limos rented, doin lines of coke in 'em

Wit a bunch of guys hoppin out all high and indo scented

Cuz I'm Shady, they call me as crazy

As the world was over this whole Y2K thing

And by the way, *N'SYNC why do they sing

Am I the only one who realizes they stink?

Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?

Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?

It's why I tend to block out when I hear things

Cuz all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring

So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger

Longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina

Cuz if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz

It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this!

I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother

I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her

and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets

And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches

I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous

and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin

startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (""God damnit!"")

I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin

with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started

These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage

What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars

All I see is sissies in magazines smiling

Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?

Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned

passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?

New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick

Boy/girl groups make me sick

And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public

I'ma love it.. (hahaha)

Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)

Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)

Then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)

A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me

and run around screamin, ""I don't care, just bite me"" (nah nah)

I think I was put here to annoy the world

and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl

Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer

and call themselves ""Clowns"" cause they look queer

Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay

Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)

And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out

Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out

after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out

(AHHH!) Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!

Look at y'all runnin your mouth again

when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10

And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females

in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails

""Slim Anus,"" you damn right, Slim Anus

I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!



Chorus Two: Eminem



Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)

I'm not a wrestler guy,

I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)

Come and see me on the streets alone

if you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)

And if you wanna run your mouth

then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)



[Eminem]

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?

You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy

Now because of this blonde mop that's on top

and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?

The underground just spunned around and did a 360

Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies

""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,

so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""

My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million

She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin

Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?

All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress

Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?

It doesn't matter you {*several seconds of silence*} faggot!

Talkin about I fabricated my past

He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh!)

So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?

For every million I make, another relative sues

Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper

All the sudden, I got 90 Slim cousins (Hey it's me!)

A half-brother and sister who never seen me

or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV

Now everybody's so happy and proud

I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house

Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand

to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp

Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast

and what do I see? A picture of my big white ass

Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:

uhh, here - DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL

Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell

Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

(aight)
Guess what? I ain't coming in yet...
I'll come in a minute
Aiyyo; this is my love song, it goes like this

Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark

This is how we used to make the party start

We used to, mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark

And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk

And by the, sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl

And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf

And my pre-diction is you're gon' probably fall

either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

And every-thing's spinnin, you're beginnin to think women 

are swimmin in pink linen again in the sink

Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished

You are now allowed to officially slap bitches

You have the right to remain violent and start wilin

Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein you

Get in your car, start it, and start drivin

over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up

{*spaceman voice*} Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot

Look at the life on this planet sir, no sign of it

All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin

And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it

Let me out of this place, I'm outta place

I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace

I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow

I'll be back in an hour or so



Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa-ohh!)

Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve (Whoa-ohh!)

I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa-ohh!)

These drugs really got ahold of me (Whoa-ohh!)

Cause every time I try to tell them, ""No"" (No-ohh!)

They won't let me ever let them go (Go-ohh!)

I'ma sucka all I gotta say (Whoa-ohh!)

is drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa-ohh!)



In third grade, all I used to do

was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubix Cube

Seventeen years later I'm as Rude as Jude

Schemin on the first chick with the hugest boobs

I've got no game, and every face looks the same

They've got no name, so I don't need game to play

I just say whatever I want to whoever I want

Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want

However, I do show some respect to few

This ecstacy's, got me standin next to you

Getting sentimental as fuck spillin guts to you

We just met, but I think I'm in love with you

But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too

Wake up in the mornin like ""Yo, what the fuck we do?""

I gotta go bitch, you know I have stuff to do

Cause if I get caught cheatin then I'm stuck with you

But in the long run

These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later

But fuck it, I'm on one

So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord

So it's not a straight line no more

Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls

Shit's stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur

Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more

So bye for now, I'm goin to try to find some more



Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa-ohh!)

Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve (Whoa-ohh!)

I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa-ohh!)

These drugs really got ahold of me (Whoa-ohh!)

Cause every time I try to tell them, ""No"" (No-ohh!)

They won't let me ever let them go (Go-ohh!)

I'ma sucka all I gotta say (Whoa-ohh!)

is drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa-ohh!)



That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow

When you swallow it all wollow and drown in your sorrow

And tomorrow you're probably gonna want to do it again

What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it

And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?

And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again

It's your life, live it however you wanna

Mari-ju-uana is everywhere, where was you brought up?

It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin

Cause none of this shit is gonna mean shit where we're goin

They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin

Even though you wake up feelin like shit every mornin

But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do

Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you

If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't

I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't

But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated

to better drugs and updated

But I still got a lot of growin up to do

I still got a whole lot of throwin up to spew

But when it's all said and done I'll be 40

before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin stories

with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap

Babysiting for Hailey while Hailey's out gettin smashed



Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa-ohh!)

Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve (Whoa-ohh!)

I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa-ohh!)

These drugs really got ahold of me (Whoa-ohh!)

Cause every time I try to tell them, ""No"" (No-ohh!)

They won't let me ever let them go (Go-ohh!)

Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit

Shrink pencil me in for my last visit

I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat

My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me

For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity

{*Mmm mm mmm!*} And bitches know me as a horny ass freak

Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still (still)

That's why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed (killed)

That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville ('Ville)

You can get capped after just havin a cavity filled (filled)

Ahahahaha, that's why we're crowned the murder capital still (still)

This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin Hamburger Hill! (Hill!)

We don't do drivebys, we park in front of houses and shoot

and when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with them too!

That's the mentality here (here) that's the reality here (here)

Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here?? (huh?)

While I'm holdin a pistol with this many calibres here?? (here??)

Got some registration and just made this shit valid this year? (year?)

Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my acts

and that's when accidents happen,

when a thousand bullets come at your house

and collapse the foundation around and they found you

and your family in it (AHHHHH!) GOT DAMNIT ADMIT IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin you move

You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage

Gotta love it, cause I expose the facade

Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God

All jokes aside, come bounce with us

Standin over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust

It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust

I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs

So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough

When things get rough I'm in the club shootin with Puff

Bitch, please - you must have a mental disease

Assume the position and get back down on your knees - c'mon

Hahaha! Gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White

pickets outside the Interscope offices every night

What if he's right? I'm just a criminal, makin a living

off of the world's misery - what in the world gives me the right

to say what I like, and walk around flippin the bird

Livin the urban life, like a white kid from the 'burbs

Dreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave

Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me

I just want you all to notice me and people to see

that somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me

It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me

is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean

So when you see me, dressin up like a nerd on TV

or heard the CD usin the fag word so freely

it's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?

{*LOWER pitch*} Suck my fuckin dick, you faggot

You happy now? Look here

I start some trouble everywhere that I go (that I go)

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
Cuz I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick

Two pills I pop 'til my pupils swell up like 2 pennies

I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties

A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass

So the rats can't chew through his last pants

I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning

Frightened with 5 little white Vicadin pills bitin' him

I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost

Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls

I light a candle and place it up on the mantle

Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle

So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'

I'm an instigator, 380 slug penetrator

Degrading, creating murders to kill haters

Accused for every crime known thru the equator

They knew I did it, for havin' blood on my gators

I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face

Wit a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi, I do shit on purpose

You never hear me say ""forgive me""

Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you

Get executed, cuz I'm a looney

I cock it back then shoot it

I love snatchin' up playas, thugs and young ballas

Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers

Ride by you in the rain while you carry your son

Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none

Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun

Got a reputation for havin' niggas run up they funds

Used to be the type of nigga that was full of someone's

'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough



Repeat 1

A lot of people ask me.. stupid fuckin questions
A lot of people think that.. what I say on records
or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life
or that I believe in it
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that.. 

I'm actually gonna do it

or that I believe in it

Well, shit.. if you believe that

then I'll kill you

You know why?

Cuz I'm a



CRIMINAL

CRIMINAL

You god damn right

I'm a CRIMINAL

Yeah, I'm a CRIMINAL



[Eminem]

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge

That'll stab you in the head

whether you're a fag or lez

Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest

Pants or dress - hate fags? The answer's ""yes""

Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic

Starin at my jeans, watchin my genitals bulgin (Ooh!)

That's my motherfuckin balls, you'd better let go of em

They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of em

Hey, it's me, Versace

Whoops, somebody shot me!

And I was just checkin the mail

Get it? Checkin the 'male'?

How many records you expectin to sell

after your second LP sends you directly to jail?

C'mon!-- Relax guy, I like gay men

Right, Ken? Give me an amen (AAA-men!)

Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus

Heal this child, help us destroy these demons

Oh, and please send me a brand new car

And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital

Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher

You can't reach me, my mom can't neither

You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause

I watch TV, and Comcast cable

and you ain't able to stop these thoughts

You can't stop me from toppin these charts

And you can't stop me from droppin each March

with a brand new cd for these fuckin retards

Duhhh, and to think, it's just little ol' me

Mr. ""Don't Give A Fuck,"" still won't leave



Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X)



I'm a CRIMINAL

Cuz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime

to tell em what's on my mind - I guess I'm a CRIMINAL

but I don't gotta say a word, I just flip em the bird

and keep goin, I don't take shit from no one



[Eminem]

My mother did drugs - tar, liquor, cigarettes, and speed

The baby came out - disfigured, ligaments indeed

It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she

Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me

I'm a CRIMINAL - an animal caged who turned crazed

But how the fuck you sposed to grow up when you weren't raised?

So as I got older and I got a lot taller

My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker

than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word ...

My morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral

Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk

Off of his own employee

Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me

You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired

and my nose is pointy

I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die

in plane crashes and laughs

As long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em

-inem and Kim combined - *kch* the maniac's in

Replacin the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today

He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin his place

(Mm-mm-mmm!) Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face

Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place

I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away

I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?

I'm a CRIMINAL



[Interlude Skit]

Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker

get the motherfuckin money and get the fuck up outta there

[Em] Aight

I'll be right here waitin on you

[Em] Aight

Yo Em

[Em] What?!

Don't kill nobody this time

[Em] Awwright... god damn, fuck...

(whistling) how you doin'?

[Teller] HI, how can I help you?

[Eminem] Yeah I need to make a withdrawl

[Teller] Okay

[Eminem] Put the fuckin money in the bag bitch

and I won't kill you!

[Teller] What? Oh my god, don't kill me

[Eminem] I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin around...

[Teller] Don't kill me, please don't kill me...

[Eminem] I said I'm not gonna fuckin kill you

Hurry the fuck up! {*BOOM*} Thank you!



[Eminem]

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it

So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it

So I'll be disguised in it

And if anybody identifies the guy in it

I'll hide for five minutes

Come back, shoot the eyewitness

Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business

Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets

This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts

tuck my dick inbetween my legs and cluck

You motherfuckin chickens ain't brave enough

to say the stuff I say, so this tape is shut

Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up

To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass

And if it's not a rapper that I make it as

I'ma be a fuckin rapist in a Jason mask

Excuse me!

Can I have the attention of the class for one second?



Hi, kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)

Wanna see me stick 9 inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh huh!)

Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah!)

Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)

My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight

But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (um...)

And Dr. Dre said ""Slim Shady, you a basehead!""

Uh-uh! ""So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!""

Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else

‘Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt

Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off, and smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross

I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass

Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast

Come here, slut! ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!""

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high

Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35

I smacked him in his face with an eraser

Chased him with a stapler, stapled his nuts to a stack of papers

Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up

Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup

Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship

While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends!""

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to

I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (damn)

I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper

Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her

You know you blew up when the women rush your stands

And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans

This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph

(Dude, can I get your autograph?)

So I signed it: ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!""

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)

Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!

I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)

I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Yup)

Am I coming or going? I can barely decide

I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead!)

All my life I was very deprived

I ain't had a woman in years and my palm's too hairy to hide (Whoops)

Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk

I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here!)

When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits

How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!

I lay awake and strap myself in the bed

Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)

I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)

Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Fed up with life and the way things are going (I'm going fucking insane), 
he decides to rob a liquor store (I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more, homes).
But on his way in he has a sudden change of heart (Shit is mine), 
and suddenly (I gotta do this) his conscience comes into play (I gotta do this).

Alright, stop (Uh?), now before you walk in the door

Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer

You better think of the consequence

(Who are you?) I'm your motherfuckin' conscience!

That's nonsense! Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs

And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs (Can I borrow this?)

Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days

If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to

The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you

Think about it before you walk in the door first

Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

Fuck that, do that shit! Shoot that bitch!

Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?

Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?

Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)

Not over this shit (Stop!), drop the biscuit (I will!)

Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you

You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude



Stan: Come on, just come in here for a minute.

Girl: I don't know.

Stan: Look...

Girl: Damn.

Stan: Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?

Girl: Oh—okay.

Stan: Give me a kiss. Pull your pants off, come on.



Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play.



Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek

And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink

Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe

Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old

You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair

Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Huh-uh)

Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare

'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there

Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?

No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest

Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?

Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail



(Man, it feels good to be home.) Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man. (What the fuck!? — Grady!)



Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'

Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'

While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off

Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off!

Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?

What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?

Alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady

But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?

Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?

That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard

You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?

(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?

(I'ma kill you, motherfucker!) Huh-uh-uh, temper, temper

Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK

Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way

How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went

Been there, done that

Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?

Shoot 'em both, Grady! Where's your gun at?"

These are the results of a thousand electric volts

A neck with bolts, ""Nurse we're losin him, check the pulse!""

A kid who refused to respect adults

Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose

A corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery

Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me

And I might snap, one day just like that

I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack



(Whosssssh) My first day in junior high, this kid said,

""It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die""

I looked at my watch it was one twenty

""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!?""

He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse...""

My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first

Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache it works""

I screamed, ""Owww! My appendix feels like they could burst!

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born

Drugs is what they used to say I was on

They say I never knew which way I was goin

But everywhere I go they keep playin my song



Brain damage, ever since the day I was born

Drugs is what they used to say I was on

They say I never knew which way I was goin

But everywhere I go they keep playin my song



Brain damage..

Way before my baby daughter Hailey

I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey

An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes

so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers

One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin

And had me in the position to beat me into submission

He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,

Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat



I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef""

But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe

He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honkey!""

The principal walked in (What's going on in here?)

and started helpin him stomp me

I made them think they beat me to death

Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left

Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth

Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws



Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools

""This is for every time you took my orange juice,

or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.

Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.

I'm gettin you back bully! Now once and for good.""

I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could

and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood

Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..

.. Made it home, later that same day

Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray

I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read

I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed

My mother started screamin, ""What are you on, drugs?!?

Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!"" (Sorry!)

She beat me over the head with the remote control

opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull

I picked it up and screamed, ""Look bitch, what have you done?!?""



[M] ""Oh my God, I'm sorry son""

[E] ""Shut up you cunt!"" I said, ""Fuck it!""

Took it and stuck it back up in my head

then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck



Brain damage, ever since the day I was born

Drugs is what they used to say I was on

They say I never knew which way I was goin

But everywhere I go they keep playin my song



Brain damage..

It's brain damage..

I got brain damage..

It's brain damage..

It's probably brain damage..

It's brain damage..

What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground

What are friends?

Friends are people that you think are your friends

But they really your enemies, with secret indentities

and disguises, to hide they true colors

So just when you think you close enough to be brothers

they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin

What is money?

Money is what makes a man act funny

Money is the root of all evil

Money'll make them same friends come back around

swearing that they was always down

What is life?

I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins

I'm tired of committing so many sins

Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins

Tired of never having any ends

Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins

I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins

Tired of not having a deal

Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel

Tired of drowning in my sorrow

Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo

I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off

I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour

then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off

I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough

Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk

for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk

I'm tired of using plastic silverware

Tired of working in Building Square

Tired of not being a millionaire



But if I had a million dollars

I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics

If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick

without a condom on, while I'm on the john

If I had a million bucks

it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out

robbing armored trucks

If I had one wish

I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss



I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor

Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store

I'm tired of not having a phone

Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on

Tired of not driving a BM

Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him

Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM

Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum

Tired of not being on tour

Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work

in the back of a Contour

I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones

Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns

Tired of being stared at

I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat

Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz

Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs

Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me

saying they wasn't feeling me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""

I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs

Tired of J-L-B saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives""



But if I had a million dollars

I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics

If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick

without a condom on, while I'm on the john

If I had a million bucks

it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out

robbing armored trucks

If I had one wish

You know what I'm saying?

I'm tired of all of this bullshit

Telling me to be positive

How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?

Know what I'm sayin?

I rap about shit around me, shit I see

Know what I'm sayin? Right now I'm tired of everything

Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city

Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin?

But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin?

Just fed up

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me! I've been with 10 women who got HIV Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me! I got genital warts and it burns when I pee Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me! I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree You probably wanna grow up to be just like me!!!"

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world

Now you sitting in the corner crying

And now it's my fault my fault



I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave

And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved

A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up

with first aid tape and raped on the first date

Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin

who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)

Told me she was goin back into usin again (Nah!)

I said, ""Wait, first try this hallucinogen

It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin

C'mere, let's go in here"" *knocks on the door*

""Who's in the den?""

""It's me and Kelly!""

""My bad, (sorry) let's try another room""

I don't trust you!

""Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom

This'll help you get in touch with your roots

We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods

Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party is so drab

""Oh dag!!""

What?

""I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!""

Huh?!



I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

I never meant to bring you to my world

Now you sitting in the corner crying

And now it's my fault my fault



""I'm sorry!"" 



I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

Now you sitting in the corner crying

And now it's my fault my fault



""Yo Sue!""

Get away from me, I don't know you

Oh shoot, she's tripping..

I need to go puke!! (Bleahh!)

I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major

I just wanted to make you appreciate nature

Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya

The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you

So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?

That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out

She said,

Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!

I said, ""I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin my t-shirt"" (Let go!)

""Would you calm down you're startin to scare me""

She said,

I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married

I don't even have any kids and I can't cook

(Hello!) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!

We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late 

Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate



I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

I never meant to bring you to my world

Now you sitting in the corner crying

And now it's my fault my fault 

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

I never meant to bring you to my world

Now you sitting in the corner crying

And now it's my fault my fault. It was an accident!



Susan (wait!) Where you goin? You better be careful

Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled

I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue

Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb

I'll be right back just chill baby please?

I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these

""John, where's Dave at before I bash you?""

He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!

""Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance

There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants

choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left 

of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?""

Well it depends on how may you had

""I took three, she ate the other twenty-two caps

Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, drinkin Lysol""

She's gonna die dude

""I know and it's my fault!""

Can you hear me?

(Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee)

[Em] Aight, ay turn my headphones up

(bust it bust it)



[Eminem]

My favoite color is red, like the blood shed

from Kurt Cobain's head, when he shot himself dead

Women all grabbin at my shishkabob

Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve

(I can't stand white people!)

You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so

Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat

I got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}

I'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show

(Yo can you sign this right here?)

I just remembered that I'm absent minded

Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it

I'm freestylin every verse that I spit

cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (umm, one two)

I told the doc I need a change in sickness

and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis

Put my LP on your Christmas gift list

You wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this



Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8X)



[Eminem]

Yo.. yo yo yo yo

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again

That's why I write songs where I die at the end

Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck

and I was wavin it at everybody screamin, ""I suck"" (I SUCK!!!)

I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd

and yell out loud, ""All y'all get the hell out now""

Fuck rap, I'm givin it up y'all, I'm sorry

(But Eminem this is your record release party!)

I'm bored out of my gourd -- so I took a hammer 

and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford

Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard

who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)

One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet

I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage

(ohhhhhhh) And if you ever see a video for this shit

I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit



Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8X)



[Eminem]

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit

Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy {*wolf whistle*}

So I told em I was Mike D

They was like, ""Gee I don't know, he might be!""

I told em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert

I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster (okay) peace out (bye!!)""

Then I jetted to the weed house

Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles

Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick

Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick (*slurping*}

Made a couple of crank calls collect [*brrrrrrring, click*]

""Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?""

I wanna make songs all the fellas dub

And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

So just remember when I bomb your set

Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset



Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (20X)"

This song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And who have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck
Verse One:



I feel like I'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net

I'm popping perkasets, I'm a nervous wreck

I deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check 

Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt

Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged

Full of venom and rage

Especially when I'm engaged

And my daughter's down to her last diaper

That's got my ass hyper

I pray that god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer

Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders

These overnight stars becoming autograph signers

We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us

Along with the small fry's and average half pinters

While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas

Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us

Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless

Snakes slither in the grass spineless



Chorus: repeat 2X



That's Rock Bottom

When this life makes you mad enough to kill

That's Rock Bottom

When you want something bad enough you'll steal

That's Rock Bottom

When you feel you have had it up to here

Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear



Verse Two:



My life is full of empty promises

And broken dreams

I'm hoping things will look up

But there ain't no job openings

I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished

Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished

And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay

And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day

But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play

Cause when we die we know were all going the same way

It's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan

When all you need is bucks to be the man

Plus a luxury sedan

Too comfortable and roomy in a six

They threw me in the mix

With all these gloomy lunatics

Walk around depressed

And smoke a pound of ses a day

And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today

My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play

Live half my life and throw the rest away



Chorus



There's people that love me and people that hate me

But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady

I want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame

That Means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames

That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name

Lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain

Right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom

I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em

I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em

Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em

My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em

And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em

And while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them

I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?

Cause I never went gold of one song

I'm running up on someone's lawns with guns drawn



Chorus"

Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't

It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen

I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*

And check out the man he goes by the name of er...



Verse One: Eminem



Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady

I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady

I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer

Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer

You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from

You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album

Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open

I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then

My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)

I have a disease and they don't know what to call it

Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash

Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass

Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin

You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson 

The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton

I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman



Chorus:



So when you see me on your block with two glocks 

Screamin _Fuck the World_ like Tupac

I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin

tellin your boys that I'm on crack

I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

So put my tape back on the rack

Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack

I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

But see me on the street and duck

Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed

Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!



Verse Two: Eminem



I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone

I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone

I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason

I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin

Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview

I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review

I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals

This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols

But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles

Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)

Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion

Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion

The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic

Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict

Half animal, half man

Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can

With more holes than an Afghan



Chorus



Verse Three: Eminem



Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)

I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine

I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin

Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion

Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure

I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher

I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches

Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes

In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush

Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush

Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed

Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team

Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian

Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again

I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median

Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in



Chorus

I dont know why this world keep turning
Round and Round
But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now

Yes man

As the World Turns

We all experience things in life

Trials and Tribulations

That we all must go through

When someone wants to test us

When someone tries our patience



[Eminem]

I hang with a bunch of hippies

and wacky tobacco planters

Who swallow lit roaches

and light up like jack-o-lanterns

Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts

Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source

They never should've booted me out of reform school

Deformed fool,takin a shit in a warm pool

They threw me out the Ramada Inn

I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!)

It all started when my mother took my bike away

Cuz I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave

After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers

Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my counselors

Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman

Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin

And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,

He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed

May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class

That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who Me?)

Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig

She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig

Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig

I felt the evilness and started transformin (RARRRR!)

It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming

Grabbed that bitch by her hair

Drug her across the ground

And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down

Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop

While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop



Chorus



As the World Turns

These are the days of our lives

These are the things that we must go through

Day by day



[Eminem]

We drive around in million dollar sports cars

While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards

Outsiders, and we suing the courts

Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source

Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat

Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at

Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage

Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch

I met a slut and said ""What up, its nice to meet ya""

I'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza

But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month

But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt

But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers

Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist

So gimme all your money

And don't try nothin funny

Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to outrun me

I went to grab my gun

Thats when her ass put it on me

Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry

I fell through the glass doors

Started causin a scene

Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine

Jumped up with a broken back

Thank god I was smokin crack all day

And doped up off coke and smack

All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse

Now I wanna kill her

But so I gotta catch her first

Ran through Rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut

Saw the house she ran up in

And shot her fuckin porch up

Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut

Looked around the room

Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut

I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!

You might as well come out now

She said ""Come in, its unlocked!""

I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne

And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn

She said ""Come her big boy, lets get acquainted""

I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it

She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her

I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her

I started to beg ""No, please let go""

But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll

With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled

I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple

Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick

Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!

Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it

It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage

I shouted ""Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!""

Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (Ahh!! Ahhh!)

Come here bitch!

Come here!

Take this motherfuckin dick!

Bitch, come here!



Chorus to fade



And as we go along

Throughout the days of our lives

We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday

That we must go through

These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere

Every day

Every single day the world keeps turning"

Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (huh?)
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl (I did!)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, ""Fuck the world!""
(I'm Slim Shady..) so come and kill me while my name's hot

And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)

I think I got a generation brainwashed

to pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot (uhh-oh)

Stop they blood flow until they veins clot

I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch

Purple haze and acid raindrops

Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)

Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top

Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop

You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you

So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you



I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets

I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free

You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin

(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!



[Eminem]

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)

I like birds, bees, I like people

I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful (hehehe)

like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)

The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike

while I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like

cause this is how I am in real life (mm-hmm)

I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)

How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat

when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)

So bring the money by tonight - cause your wife 

said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)

I try to keep it positive and play it cool

Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)

Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better

Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter



I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets

Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit 

(What?? That's my shit!)

People don't buy shit no more they just dub it

That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh)

But they love it when you make your business public

so fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)

And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it

cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin when I say it

-- Well, I do take pills, don't do speed

Don't do crack (uh-uhh) don't do coke, I do smoke weed (uh-huh)

Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (yup)

I just wanna make a few things clear

My baby mama's not dead (uh-uhh) she's still alive and bitchin (yup)

And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin

It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested

I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested



I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets

[Cowboy]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over

Sheriffs couldn't stop em

Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen

Got murdered in cold blood

That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home

They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern

And on a quiet night

You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine



[Eminem]

I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet

I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat

I translate when my voice is read through a sismograph

And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (AAHHH)

Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed

Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead

Told him each one of his boys is dead

I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said



[Royce]

Who hard? yo I done heard worse

We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other

To see which one'll swerve first

Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds

That of a globe on top of nine other planets

Kissed the cheek of the devil

Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto

Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist

Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot

One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse

In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse

And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations

Collaborating, attemptin to take over the earth



[Eminem]

Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil

We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people

He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal

Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)

We ain't eager to be legal

So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle

I breathe ether in three amounts

When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle

Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range

Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain

(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off

Cuz I can't find a decent vain



[Royce]

The disaster wit dreds

I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough

To kill my soul after I'm dead

When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter

Cuz I serve any stranger wit money

I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains

While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches

Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral

Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you

Whippin human ass, throwin blows crackin jaws 

Wit my fists wrapped in gause, dipped in glue and glass

I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's

Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me

From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche

And bust till volcanoes errupt



[interlude]

*phone rings*

Hello? (Billy) Aiyyo what's up (we're comin to get you)

STOP, THEY KNOW IT'S US!!



[Eminem]

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-ah)

I'm the one who burned your house down (oh)

Well I'm out now (shit), and this time I'm comin back to blow your house up

And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of

Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms

And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms

And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave

I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe



[Royce] (Eminem)

Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil

And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people

He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal

Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel

(We'll be waitin) See you in hell

Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady

See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye)

Bad Meets Evil, what? (till next time)



[Cowboy]

And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil

Two of the most wanted individuals in the county

Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens

It's too bad they had to go out the way they did

Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon

But their spirits still live on till this day

Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that?

A lot of people ask me.. am I afraid of death..
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think.. that I worship the devil..
that I do all types of.. retarded shit

Look, I can't change the way I think

And I can't change the way I am

But if I offended you? Good

Cause I still don't give a fuck



I'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo

Hopped in the window, shoppin a demo at gunpoint

A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?

Fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this

Livin amuk, never givin a fuck

Gimme the keys I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck

But I smoke dope in a cab

I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab

Come back the next week and re-open your scab (YEAH!)

A killer instinct runs in the blood

Emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud

I've calmed down now -- I was heavy once into drugs

I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz

My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn

The rest of my body's still bein operated on

I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin this rhyme

Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time



Chorus: 



For all the weed that I've smoked - yo this blunt's for you

To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!

To all the friends I used to have - yo I miss my past

But the rest of you assholes can KISS MY ASS

For all the drugs that I've done - yo I'm still gon' do

To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!

For everytime I reminisce - yo I miss my past

But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can KISS MY ASS



[Eminem]

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you

And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue

I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles

And pull you apart from both angles

I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins

And bust open like broken water mains

So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb 

Cause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm

Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm

So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb

Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on

And the pants to match (""Here momma try em on"")

I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives,

a brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives

(Shittin on rappers) Causin hospital accidents

God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again 



Chorus



[Eminem]

I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it

Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Ohh shit!)

Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?

I can't rap anymore - I just murdered the alphabet

Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches

I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches

I don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches 

Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes

Never ran with a click - I'm a posse

Kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me

From the second I was born, my momma lost me 

I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy

I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place 

My worst day on this earth was my first birthday

Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?

Fuck, I was born during the earthquake



Chorus"

Mic check.. (My dick!)
Testing.. one, two (* Eminem hach-spits on mic *)
Ffff-fuck.. (My dick!) My nuts..
My attitude is worse than NWA's was

I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people 

who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does (My tattoo!)

You see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin, 

""Puffy is good, (HEY!) but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (WAIT!)

I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it

Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like

You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway

I'm just tryin to get my porno career started

Every place and event.. +Been There, Done That+

Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went 

(* zipper sound *) ""Come on, let's go!""

Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters

Lesson One: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers

Lesson Two: Face em and diss em (whattup dog?)

Don't give em a demo; kidnap em (I want you to come with me)

and make em come to your basement and listen 

(you're gonna fuckin check this out)

Lesson Three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus 

and put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)

Lesson Four: 'Know you heard this before'

""Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""

Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?

Get the Withest A&R you can find

Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can

Lesson Five: Get a hook-up at Jive

Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live

And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't 

givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (get away from me)

Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin

cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like Master P (UNNNGGGGH!)

Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth

my balls broke both of her collarbones (OWW!)

Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah (""It's all about me.."")

Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea (""You're a dick!"")

And all three of my main girls said SEE-YA

Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin Aaliyah

(What? Oh my God!) I splish splash while I'm takin a bath

Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh

White trash -- fuckin your wife in the ass (""Oh! Ooh Shady! Oooh!"")

While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass



So if I hurt your self-esteem 

and you get dissed too bad [Yo why you diss me?]

You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had [A big dick!]

You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!""

You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

""He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!"" [Nurse! Nurse!]

You know I just be sayin that to get you mad



What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play

Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate

Hi Renee! (Oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade

in your driveway (WHAT?) and drive away (* car peels out *)

Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS

Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache

You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though

I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow

Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (MOOOOO!)

Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half

Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with +Agent Orange+

And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here!)

The demon is here, steamin this year

I rip [*Mystikal's*] voicebox out, scream in his ear (AHHHHHH!)

It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it

Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it

""Yeah I don't think this guy is well.."" I'm high as hell

I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail



[* impersonating Method Man *]

I'll fuckin, I'll fuckin

Lay your nuts on the dresser

Just your nutsack by itself

And bang them shits with a spiked bat

Cut your neck off and sew your head right back

And leave you like that



You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor

Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher

Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 

while your mother was breastfeeding

And gave her the flesh-eating disease

I'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees

and walkin through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans

(Am I a Blood or a Crip?) Wakin up the next day in breathin machines

Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes

on how you just got smoked, and if you do live

You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke



So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad

You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had

You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad""

You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

""He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad""

You know I just be sayin that to get you mad



I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (uh-huh)

That's right, Slim Shady (yup) Sway & Tech

Sprayin wreck (bitch)

And we don't give a heck (uh-uh)

or a damn.. or a fuck.. or a shit

So suck my motherfuckin dick"

Uh-uh! ""So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!""

Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else

‘Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt

Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off, and smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high

Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35

I smacked him in his face with an eraser

Chased him with a stapler, stapled his nuts to a stack of papers

Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up

Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup

Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship

While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends!""

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to

I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (damn)

I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper

Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her

You know you blew up when the women rush your stands

And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans

This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph

(Dude, can I get your autograph?)

So I signed it: ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!""

Am I coming or going? I can barely decide

I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead!)

All my life I was very deprived

I ain't had a woman in years and my palm's too hairy to hide (Whoops)

Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk

I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here!)

When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits

How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!

I lay awake and strap myself in the bed

Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)

I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)

Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer

You better think of the consequence

(Who are you?) I'm your motherfuckin' conscience!

That's nonsense! Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs

And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs (Can I borrow this?)

Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days

Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek

And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink

Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe

Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old

You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair

Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Huh-uh)

Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare

Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'

Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'

While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off

Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off!

Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?

What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?

Alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady

But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born

Drugs is what they used to say I was on

They say I never knew which way I was goin

But everywhere I go they keep playin my song



Brain damage, ever since the day I was born

Drugs is what they used to say I was on

They say I never knew which way I was goin

But everywhere I go they keep playin my song



Brain damage..

Way before my baby daughter Hailey

I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey

An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes

so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers

One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin

And had me in the position to beat me into submission

He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,

Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat



I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef""

But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe

He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honkey!""

The principal walked in (What's going on in here?)

and started helpin him stomp me

I made them think they beat me to death

Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left

Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth

Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws



Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools

""This is for every time you took my orange juice,

or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.

Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.

I'm gettin you back bully! Now once and for good.""

I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could

and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood

Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..

.. Made it home, later that same day

Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray

I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read

I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed

My mother started screamin, ""What are you on, drugs?!?

Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!"" (Sorry!)

She beat me over the head with the remote control

opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull

I picked it up and screamed, ""Look bitch, what have you done?!?""



[M] ""Oh my God, I'm sorry son""

[E] ""Shut up you cunt!"" I said, ""Fuck it!""

Took it and stuck it back up in my head

then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck



Brain damage, ever since the day I was born

Drugs is what they used to say I was on

They say I never knew which way I was goin

But everywhere I go they keep playin my song



Brain damage..

It's brain damage..

What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground

What are friends?

Friends are people that you think are your friends

But they really your enemies, with secret indentities

and disguises, to hide they true colors

So just when you think you close enough to be brothers

they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin

What is money?

Money is what makes a man act funny

Money is the root of all evil

Money'll make them same friends come back around

swearing that they was always down

What is life?

I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins

I'm tired of committing so many sins

Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins

Tired of never having any ends

Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins

I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins

Tired of not having a deal

Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel

Tired of drowning in my sorrow

Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo

I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off

I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour

then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off

I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough

Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk

for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk

I'm tired of using plastic silverware

Tired of working in Building Square

Tired of not being a millionaire



But if I had a million dollars

I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics

If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick

without a condom on, while I'm on the john

If I had a million bucks

it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out

robbing armored trucks

If I had one wish

I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss



I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor

Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store

I'm tired of not having a phone

Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on

Tired of not driving a BM

Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him

Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM

Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum

Tired of not being on tour

Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work

in the back of a Contour

I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones

Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns

Tired of being stared at

I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat

Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz

Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs

Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me

saying they wasn't feeling me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""

I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs

Tired of J-L-B saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives""



But if I had a million dollars

I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics

If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick

without a condom on, while I'm on the john

If I had a million bucks

it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out

robbing armored trucks

If I had one wish

I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss



You know what I'm saying?

I'm tired of all of this bullshit

Telling me to be positive

How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?

Know what I'm sayin?

I rap about shit around me, shit I see

Know what I'm sayin? Right now I'm tired of everything

Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city

Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin?

But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin?

Just fed up

That's my word"

I love you I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain? I take a breather and sighed; either I'm high, or I'm nuts Cause if you ain't tiltin this room, neither am I So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

And now it's my fault my fault



I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave

And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved

A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up

with first aid tape and raped on the first date

Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin

who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)

Told me she was goin back into usin again (Nah!)

I said, ""Wait, first try this hallucinogen

It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin

C'mere, let's go in here"" *knocks on the door*

""Who's in the den?""

""It's me and Kelly!""

""My bad, (sorry) let's try another room""

I don't trust you!

""Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom

This'll help you get in touch with your roots

We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods

Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party is so drab

""Oh dag!!""

What?

""I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!""

Huh?!



I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

""Yo Sue!""

Get away from me, I don't know you

Oh shoot, she's tripping..

I need to go puke!! (Bleahh!)

I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major

I just wanted to make you appreciate nature

Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya

The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you

So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?

That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out

She said,

Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!

I said, ""I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin my t-shirt"" (Let go!)

""Would you calm down you're startin to scare me""

She said,

I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married

I don't even have any kids and I can't cook

(Hello!) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!

We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late 

Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate



I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

I never meant to bring you to my world

And now it's my fault my fault 

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

I never meant to bring you to my world

And now it's my fault my fault. It was an accident!



Susan (wait!) Where you goin? You better be careful

Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled

I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue

Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb

I'll be right back just chill baby please?

I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these

""John, where's Dave at before I bash you?""

He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!

""Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance

There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants

choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left 

of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?""

Well it depends on how may you had

""I took three, she ate the other twenty-two caps

Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, drinkin Lysol""

She's gonna die dude

Can you hear me?

(Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee)

[Em] Aight, ay turn my headphones up

(bust it bust it)



[Eminem]

My favoite color is red, like the blood shed

from Kurt Cobain's head, when he shot himself dead

Women all grabbin at my shishkabob

Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve

(I can't stand white people!)

You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so

Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat

I got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}

I'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show

(Yo can you sign this right here?)

I just remembered that I'm absent minded

Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it

I'm freestylin every verse that I spit

cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (umm, one two)

I told the doc I need a change in sickness

and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis

Put my LP on your Christmas gift list

You wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this



Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8X)



[Eminem]

Yo.. yo yo yo yo

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again

That's why I write songs where I die at the end

Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck

and I was wavin it at everybody screamin, ""I suck"" (I SUCK!!!)

I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd

and yell out loud, ""All y'all get the hell out now""

Fuck rap, I'm givin it up y'all, I'm sorry

(But Eminem this is your record release party!)

I'm bored out of my gourd -- so I took a hammer 

and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford

Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard

who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)

One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet

I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage

(ohhhhhhh) And if you ever see a video for this shit

I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit



Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8X)



[Eminem]

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit

Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy {*wolf whistle*}

So I told em I was Mike D

They was like, ""Gee I don't know, he might be!""

I told em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert

I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster (okay) peace out (bye!!)""

Then I jetted to the weed house

Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles

Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick

Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick (*slurping*}

Made a couple of crank calls collect [*brrrrrrring, click*]

""Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?""

I wanna make songs all the fellas dub

And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

So just remember when I bomb your set

Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset



Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (20X)"

This song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And who have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck
Verse One:



I feel like I'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net

I'm popping perkasets, I'm a nervous wreck

I deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check 

Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt

Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged

Full of venom and rage

Especially when I'm engaged

And my daughter's down to her last diaper

That's got my ass hyper

I pray that god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer

Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders

These overnight stars becoming autograph signers

We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us

Along with the small fry's and average half pinters

While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas

Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us

Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless

Snakes slither in the grass spineless



Chorus: repeat 2X



That's Rock Bottom

When this life makes you mad enough to kill

That's Rock Bottom

When you want something bad enough you'll steal

That's Rock Bottom

When you feel you have had it up to here

Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear



Verse Two:



My life is full of empty promises

And broken dreams

I'm hoping things will look up

But there ain't no job openings

I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished

Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished

And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay

And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day

But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play

Cause when we die we know were all going the same way

It's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan

When all you need is bucks to be the man

Plus a luxury sedan

Too comfortable and roomy in a six

They threw me in the mix

With all these gloomy lunatics

Walk around depressed

And smoke a pound of ses a day

And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today

My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play

Live half my life and throw the rest away



Chorus



There's people that love me and people that hate me

But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady

I want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame

That Means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames

That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name

Lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain

Right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom

I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em

I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em

Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em

My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em

And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em

And while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them

I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?

Cause I never went gold of one song

I'm running up on someone's lawns with guns drawn

And check out the man he goes by the name of er...



Verse One: Eminem



Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady

I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady

I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer

Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer

You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from

You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album

Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open

I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then

My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)

I have a disease and they don't know what to call it

Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash

Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass

Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin

You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson 

The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton

I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman



Chorus:



So when you see me on your block with two glocks 

Screamin _Fuck the World_ like Tupac

I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin

tellin your boys that I'm on crack

I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

So put my tape back on the rack

Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack

I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

But see me on the street and duck

Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed

Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!



Verse Two: Eminem



I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone

I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone

I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason

I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin

Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview

I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review

I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals

This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols

But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles

Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)

Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion

Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion

The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic

Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict

Half animal, half man

Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can

With more holes than an Afghan



Chorus



Verse Three: Eminem



Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)

I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine

I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin

Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion

Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure

I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher

I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches

Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes

In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush

Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush

Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed

Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team

Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian

Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again

I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median

Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in



Chorus

I dont know why this world keep turning
Round and Round
But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now

Yes man

As the World Turns

We all experience things in life

Trials and Tribulations

That we all must go through

When someone wants to test us

When someone tries our patience



[Eminem]

I hang with a bunch of hippies

and wacky tobacco planters

Who swallow lit roaches

and light up like jack-o-lanterns

Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts

Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source

They never should've booted me out of reform school

Deformed fool,takin a shit in a warm pool

They threw me out the Ramada Inn

I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!)

It all started when my mother took my bike away

Cuz I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave

After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers

Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my counselors

Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman

Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin

And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,

He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed

May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class

That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who Me?)

Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig

She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig

Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig

I felt the evilness and started transformin (RARRRR!)

It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming

Grabbed that bitch by her hair

Drug her across the ground

And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down

Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop

While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop



Chorus



As the World Turns

These are the days of our lives

These are the things that we must go through

Day by day



[Eminem]

We drive around in million dollar sports cars

While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards

Outsiders, and we suing the courts

Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source

Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat

Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at

Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage

Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch

I met a slut and said ""What up, its nice to meet ya""

I'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza

But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month

But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt

But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers

Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist

So gimme all your money

And don't try nothin funny

Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to outrun me

I went to grab my gun

Thats when her ass put it on me

Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry

I fell through the glass doors

Started causin a scene

Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine

Jumped up with a broken back

Thank god I was smokin crack all day

And doped up off coke and smack

All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse

Now I wanna kill her

But so I gotta catch her first

Ran through Rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut

Saw the house she ran up in

And shot her fuckin porch up

Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut

Looked around the room

Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut

I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!

You might as well come out now

She said ""Come in, its unlocked!""

I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne

And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn

She said ""Come her big boy, lets get acquainted""

I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it

She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her

I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her

I started to beg ""No, please let go""

But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll

With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled

I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple

Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick

Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!

Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it

It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage

I shouted ""Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!""

Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (Ahh!! Ahhh!)

Come here bitch!

Come here!

Take this motherfuckin dick!

Bitch, come here!



Chorus to fade



And as we go along

Throughout the days of our lives

We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday

That we must go through

These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere

Every day

Every single day the world keeps turning"

Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (huh?)
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl (I did!)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, ""Fuck the world!""
(I'm Slim Shady..) so come and kill me while my name's hot

And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)

I think I got a generation brainwashed

to pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot (uhh-oh)

Stop they blood flow until they veins clot

I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch

Purple haze and acid raindrops

Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)

Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top

Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop

You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you

So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you



I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets

I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free

You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin

(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!



[Eminem]

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)

I like birds, bees, I like people

I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful (hehehe)

like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)

The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike

while I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like

cause this is how I am in real life (mm-hmm)

I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)

How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat

when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)

So bring the money by tonight - cause your wife 

said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)

I try to keep it positive and play it cool

Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)

Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better

Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter



I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets

I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free

You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin

(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!



[Eminem]

Yo.. I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it 

(Aww that shit is wack!)

Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit 

(What?? That's my shit!)

People don't buy shit no more they just dub it

That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh)

But they love it when you make your business public

so fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)

And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it

cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin when I say it

-- Well, I do take pills, don't do speed

Don't do crack (uh-uhh) don't do coke, I do smoke weed (uh-huh)

Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (yup)

I just wanna make a few things clear

My baby mama's not dead (uh-uhh) she's still alive and bitchin (yup)

And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin

It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested

I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested



I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets

I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free

You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin

(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!

(Ha hah-ha, ha! Ha hah, hah..) I told you I was Shady!!

(Ha hah-ha, hah-ha! Ha hah, hah-ha, hah-ha, hah-ha)

Y'all didn't wanna believe me!

I'm Shady!!

.. And that's my name"

[Cowboy]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over

Sheriffs couldn't stop em

Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen

Got murdered in cold blood

That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home

They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern

And on a quiet night

You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine



[Eminem]

I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet

I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat

I translate when my voice is read through a sismograph

And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (AAHHH)

Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed

Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead

Told him each one of his boys is dead

I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said



[Royce]

Who hard? yo I done heard worse

We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other

To see which one'll swerve first

Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds

That of a globe on top of nine other planets

Kissed the cheek of the devil

Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto

Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist

Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot

One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse

In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse

And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations

Collaborating, attemptin to take over the earth



[Eminem]

Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil

We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people

He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal

Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)

We ain't eager to be legal

So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle

I breathe ether in three amounts

When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle

Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range

Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain

(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off

Cuz I can't find a decent vain



[Royce]

The disaster wit dreds

I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough

To kill my soul after I'm dead

When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter

Cuz I serve any stranger wit money

I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains

While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches

Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral

Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you

Whippin human ass, throwin blows crackin jaws 

Wit my fists wrapped in gause, dipped in glue and glass

I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's

Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me

From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche

And bust till volcanoes errupt



[interlude]

*phone rings*

Hello? (Billy) Aiyyo what's up (we're comin to get you)

STOP, THEY KNOW IT'S US!!



[Eminem]

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-ah)

I'm the one who burned your house down (oh)

Well I'm out now (shit), and this time I'm comin back to blow your house up

And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of

Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms

And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms

And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave

I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe



[Royce] (Eminem)

Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil

And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people

He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal

Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel

(We'll be waitin) See you in hell

Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady

See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye)

Bad Meets Evil, what? (till next time)



[Cowboy]

And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil

Two of the most wanted individuals in the county

Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens

It's too bad they had to go out the way they did

Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon

But their spirits still live on till this day

Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that?

A lot of people ask me.. am I afraid of death..
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think.. that I worship the devil..
that I do all types of.. retarded shit

Look, I can't change the way I think

And I can't change the way I am

But if I offended you? Good

Cause I still don't give a fuck



I'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo

Hopped in the window, shoppin a demo at gunpoint

A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?

Fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this

Livin amuk, never givin a fuck

Gimme the keys I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck

But I smoke dope in a cab

I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab

Come back the next week and re-open your scab (YEAH!)

A killer instinct runs in the blood

Emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud

I've calmed down now -- I was heavy once into drugs

I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz

My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn

The rest of my body's still bein operated on

I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin this rhyme

Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time



Chorus: 



For all the weed that I've smoked - yo this blunt's for you

To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!

To all the friends I used to have - yo I miss my past

But the rest of you assholes can KISS MY ASS

For all the drugs that I've done - yo I'm still gon' do

To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!

For everytime I reminisce - yo I miss my past

But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can KISS MY ASS



[Eminem]

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you

And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue

I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles

And pull you apart from both angles

I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins

And bust open like broken water mains

So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb 

Cause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm

Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm

So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb

Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on

And the pants to match (""Here momma try em on"")

I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives,

a brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives

(Shittin on rappers) Causin hospital accidents

God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again 



Chorus



[Eminem]

I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it

Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Ohh shit!)

Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?

I can't rap anymore - I just murdered the alphabet

Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches

I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches

I don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches 

Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes

Never ran with a click - I'm a posse

Kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me

From the second I was born, my momma lost me 

I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy

I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place 

My worst day on this earth was my first birthday

Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?

Fuck, I was born during the earthquake



Chorus"
