Your moms crying fuck her bust her

[Boom, Boom] Mama ain't raised no suckers

Dan Quayle, don't you know you need to get your ass kicked

Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets?

Mutha-fucker rednecks all the same

Feel a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained

That's why we burn shit and wreck

Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet

You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price

Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life

It's on, the next real nigga fall dead

Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head

Be prepared for the smoke to bust

What niggas need to do is start loc'in up

United we stand divided we fall

They can shoot one nigga

But they can't take us alll 

Let's get along with the Mexicans

And we can all have peace on the sets again

Imagine that if it took place [ha ha ha]

Keeping the smile off their white fakes

I ain't racist but lets trade places

Trace the hate 'n face it 

One nigga teach two niggas

three teach four niggas

And them niggas teach more niggas

And when we blast 

That'll be the biggest blast you've heard

And them is my last wordz"

Verse One: Live Squad

Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man

Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man

Cops step off, you know the flavor

They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior

And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet

Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin streets

It's like a madness, fuck making gravy

I rhyme and do crimes, cuz either way pays me

A little rough with a hardcore... theme

Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams

Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip

With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse

Representing YG'z yo

Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino

Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags

Stickin up spots and jumpin in Jags

Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin

And always keep a hand on the gat

Cuz a niggaz straight strugglin



Verse Two: Live Squad



I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin

I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin

I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker

But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it

Look as I cut the records hard to eject

A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit

I got energy to blast now you want the task here

Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up

But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin

Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in

Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it goin on

If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick

So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get

A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin

Get drunk but I don't think

I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch

When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch

Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch

You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame

Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game

I'm strugglin



Verse Three: 2Pac



Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang

Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang

Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back

Till I call back, niggaz runnin free better fall back

I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep

with a Mossberg wrapped in my seats

three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz

Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come

Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal

Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo

Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind

Clickin on the nine, out to get mine

I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom

Blowin motherfuckers to the moon

Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin

See me on the block, strugglin

And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed

I get in niggaz ass, blast

Straight strugglin"

Thorough Heads, Poonannynans, the Click.

Mmmm. ???, Richie Rich.

Young Guns in the house pumpin the flava.

DJ Ditch for their behavior.

Off the head, my freestyle flow.

Just a couple of motha fuckas that I know.

Damn, who did I forget? 



I'm a soulja.

Daddy was a soulja.

Strong in the struggle.

Must contend so it's on.

Raised in a house full of bad motha fuckas.

Mad motha fuckas.

Never had so we grab from the stacked motha fuckas.

Now they know me, the homies.

Raised by some crazed ass well payed OG's.

Ah shit!

Pulled up in a benzy, snatch.

The wheel as I peel out. Catch a cop's tail.

Rock shells hit. Raise a fist so they know to make a hit. 

Can I flip it? I may get wicked as I rip it.

To get specific: If the shoe fits, then kick it.

It's for the gifted. Pump your fist if you wit it.

Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit.

Now they wanna maime me.

(Told ya)

All I wanted to be was a soulja.

Bang bang boogy it's stick up.

Quit now nigga, eat a dick up.

[2Pac]
Heh, so??
You say that like that means somethin to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time

for you to be comin home talkin that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)

We been gettin along fine just without you

Me, my brother, and my mother

So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. fuck you!



[2Pac]

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight

A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night

Please send me a pops before puberty

the things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity

Moms always work, I barely see her

I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her

It's a wonder they don't understand kids today

so when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way

And I hope that he answers me

I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family

A different father every weekend

Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends

I'm gettin sick of all the friendships

As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick

How can I be a man if there's no role model?

Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle

I'm so sorry...



(Chorus)

I'm so sorry

for all this time (I'm so sorry)

for all this time

for all this time (don't lie)

I'm so sorry

for all this time (so, sorry)

for all this time

for all this time, so sorry baby!



[Wycked]

Moms had to entertain many men

Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again

I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother

Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father

Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer

Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer

Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff

Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough

Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities

Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly

That's why I'll never be a father;

unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother

(That's when I started hatin the phony smiles

Said I was an only child)

Look at mama's lonely smile

It's hard for a son to see his mother cry

She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys

I'm so sorry...



(Chorus)

I'm so sorry

for all this time

for all this time

for all this time

I'm so sorry

for all this time

for all this time (so sorry)

for all this time, so sorry baby!



[2Pac]

Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes

Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show

And ohh -I guess ya didn't know 

that I would grow to be so strong

Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong

Where was the money that you said, you would send me

talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly

Ask about school and my welfare

but it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares

You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack

You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back

Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start

Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart

So don't even start with that ""wanna be your father"" shit

Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it

I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G

Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me

You're so sorry..



(Chorus)

I'm so sorry (so sorry)

for all this time (so, so sorry)

for all this time (I'm so so sorry)

for all this time (fuck that!)

I'm so sorry

for all this time (no)

for all this time (so sorry)

for all this time, so sorry baby!



[Tupac - impersonating his father]

I never meant to leave but I was wanted

Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted

Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger

If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a

Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number

Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to

Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast

But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass

Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along

I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong

It took a little longer than I thought

I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts

Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand

all I ever wanted was for you to be a man

and grow to be the type you was meant to be

Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me

I'm so sorry...

Yea this is uh Super funk you know what I'm sayin
This is for all the players and playetts wherever you at you dig
I'm talkin about from this side to that side 

East side, West side, your side, my side

It's all about being funky man

Aiyyo give me that microphone

It's Heavy D the baritone and I'm home alone dig it 

and I'm always staying freshly dipped on 1-2-5th 

where the dogs bark and the dreadlock be sparkin spliff

Okay okay okay okay it's Heavy D again

Hallelujah I'm on your T.V. screen again

You see me on your MTV and on your BET 

and on your local focal point video show

Nigga this how it flow so fly like an eagle

No sequels no weed but I get love from all the thugs 

cause they still my people 

I'm dynamic punks panic when they see me

They get all shook up when my mic's hooked up 

Let's get it on! 



[chorus x2]

Untouchables at your door 

(Let's get it on) 

All you wack rappers hit the floor 



[2pac]

How should I plead forever thuggin on a quest to get G's

Runnin from enemies ever since the days of a seed

I'm under pressure the stress will have me drinkin

thinkin niggaz after me much too paranoid to blink

Wonder why the police don't wanna see me stackin G's

They after a playa but I won't let em capture me

I gotta thank the lord for the weed and the nicotine 

I can't sleep close my eyes I see wicked things 

I keep my pistol by my bedside one in the chamber

Preoccupied with homocide my life's in danger

Rollin down the 4-0-5, beware of stangers 

Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does

I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it till I'm gone

From out the ghetto where the jealous motherfuckers roam

Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me 

before the penitentiary 

Let's get it on!! 



[Chorus: x2]

Untouchables at your door 

(Let's get it on)

[Grand Puba]

I thought you knew I stay true to this rhyme thing I do 

I have all the honeys saying, ""Go Pu'!"" 

I flip a style from the projects building 70 apartment 6C

I turn food stamps to green stamps rough power amps 

and sold weed under corner lamps but now I'm just microphone talkin

So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walking

Niggaz got more game than Genesis

Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody wanna C 

but them youth don't trouble we 

because they fall victim to what they see hey! 

I keeps it +Reel to Reel+ like my last album title song 

but I understand it takes a year for niggaz to catch on

(hit em in the head dog) So let's get it on! yea 



[Notorious B.I.G.] 

Split the dutches fill it with the skunk we about to 

get wicked in the joint uh Notorious is glorious 

[cough, cough]

Niggaz now who's the mind blower, the weed grower 

Have you seeing doubles like Noah, the rhyme flower 

B.I.G. top notch with the glock check your pockets 

and your sockets it's just the way my pops taught me 

When you throw the drop check em throughly 

The bastard might spin around and try to bury me

And dead niggaz don't make no moves

When I'm slingin in the hood I don't fake no moves aight

Reminiscin on my swinger days 

when I drove a Caddy and my bitch sported finger waves

Yea she had the Gucci roots I had Sarducci suits

Oshkosh-begosh Coca-Cola lookin real cute

Junior M.A.F.I.A. representin Bucktown

Mac-11 cocked back niggaz better duck down

Face down you know the routine the cream

Earrings you know the drama Biggie bring

In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton

We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'



Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West

A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness

The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex

We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be

The state where you never find a dance floor empty

And pimps be on a mission for them greens

Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes

Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon

Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me

Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace

It's all good, from Diego to the Bay

Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay

Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

Shake, shake it, mama

Shake it, Cali

Shake it, shake it, baby

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it



Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'

Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'

Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player

Where cowards die and the strong ball

Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die

In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)

Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do

Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews

Famous because we throw grams

Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans

Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam

It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man

Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre

Let me serenade the streets of L.A

From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down

Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

Frisco, Frisco



And you know L.A. up in here

Pasadena, where you at?

Yeah, Inglewood

Inglewood always up to no good

Even Hollywood tryin' to get a piece, baby

Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?

Throw it up, y'all! Throw it up, throw it up!

One time, one time nigga one time! (Where?)

Runnin' from the police (Yeah I know what you mean)

No matter what I do, they got a nigga

still runnin' from the police

(Put them motherfuckin Nike's on tight and get ghost y'all)



[Dramacydal]

I ain't got nuttin on my mind, but gettin in some trouble

Lickin shots to they block leavin bloody blood puddles

for some ridah delight, now we in a gunfight

I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight

It's on me, but if I die bury me a motherfuckin G

A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me

With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece

Thug Life motherfucker gotta me runnin' from the police



Nigga, you know that's true

Catch a nigga like K-Dog, chillin wit a crew

Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re

The O.J. and it's all OK

'til that fuckin fake cop got to play the man

Ran me down the block with my glass in my hand

Damn, I hope it don't spill

Nigga chill, shit is real cock back my steel



Still runnin' from the police I gets no sleep

I got you peepin in my window while I'm smokin indo

But I ain't no motherfuckin track star, pig's got a Jeep

like Big Mouth, runnin through motherfucker's backyards

So I, grabs my piece before I flee

And instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me

Lick shots hits spots off on my piece

Cause a nigga like Big Mouth is through runnin' from the police



[Interlude: Buju Banton]

I bust off! What about the time they pull me from the Bronco

lay, they tried to cock me, but them can't gun store

When a batty bwoy do it from the mob

Ahh, pull up your pants then you screw an left squad

Look around, look around, punk police

While gwan man doesn't a come but a bad boy test

Look around, look around, punk police

Me hafta blast back, cause de blast is best



[Stretch]

Yo I was, schemin and fiendin for loots and took the crooked route

to, ghetto fame I felt the pains and now I run the game

The insane brain, cold gettin fly like a plane

on them suckers with my nigga Biggie Smalls causin ruckus



[Notorious B.I.G.]

Check it, I grew up a fuckin screw-up

Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up

Choppin rocks overnight

The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin to turn into the black Frank White



[Stretch]

And we got the workers choppin rock, Benz by the flock

And we gettin it, the dirty cops are jealous so they sweatin it

I'm lettin off smoke, hope they don't play me for no joke

and provoke the homicide, so just let the drama slide

We keepin it real, fuck how you feel, Biggie pass the steel

Let's serve these motherfuckers slugs as a fuckin meal



[Notorious B.I.G.]

We had to grow dreads to change our description

Two cops is on the milk box missin

Show they toes you know they got stepped on

A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon

Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat

I fuck around and catch a asthma attack (*heavy breathing*)

That's why I bust back, it don't phase me

When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze

Celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight

Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker



[Interlude: Buju Banton]

Now it's war, me tryin to sell, runnin from the punk po-lice

They try to cock me, but them can't gun store

What about they come to hold up me North

Pulled up the park, I left school and left buck

Look around, look around, punk police

Was about to blast with ya gun but you can't stop me

Look around, look around, punk police

Me haf to blast back, cause blast back best



[2Pac]

They got me runnin' from the five-oh

duckin and dodgin in my survival

The Benzo and I let off with my nine, hoe

I'm movin swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex

Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next

Nigga, my homey slipped and now he pays the price

He did a driveby, sixteen, now he's doin triple life

Tell me is it me or my upbringin, I spit that thug shit

Nigga motherfuck singin, I hope you got your Timberlands

on tight, cause I ain't givin up

I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night

I'm runnin' through the projects, beyotch

They'll never catch me

Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy on the, sneotch

Don't say you never heard of me, til they murder me, I'm a legend

Do Thug Niggas go to heaven?

I'm rollin with the thorough heads

We gettin ghost on them hoes and yo

I got no love for the five-oh I'm runnin' from the police

I'm tired of bein' poor & even worse I'm black
my stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch

Cops give a damn about a negro

pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero

Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares

one less hungry mouth on the welfare

First ship 'em dope & let 'em deal the brothers

give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other

It's time to fight back that's what Huey said

2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead

I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere

unless we share with each other

We gotta start makin' changes

learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers

and that's how it's supposed to be

How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?

I'd love to go back to when we played as kids

but things changed, and that's the way it is



[Bridge w/ changing ad libs]

Come on come on

That's just the way it is

Things'll never be the same

That's just the way it is

aww yeah

[Repeat]



[2]

I see no changes all I see is racist faces

misplaced hate makes disgrace to races

We under I wonder what it takes to make this

one better place, let's erase the wasted

Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right

'cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight

and only time we chill is when we kill each other

it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other

And although it seems heaven sent

We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh

It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact

the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks

But some things will never change

try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game

Now tell me what's a mother to do

bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you

You gotta operate the easy way

""I made a G today"" But you made it in a sleazy way

sellin' crack to the kid. "" I gotta get paid,""

Well hey, well that's the way it is



[Bridge]



[Talking:]

We gotta make a change...

It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.

Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live

and let's change the way we treat each other.

You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do

what we gotta do, to survive.



[3]

And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace

It's war on the streets & the war in the Middle East

Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs

so the police can bother me

And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do

But now I'm back with the facts givin' it back to you

Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,

crack you up and pimp smack you up

You gotta learn to hold ya own

they get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone

But tell the cops they can't touch this

I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this

That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool

my mama didn't raise no fool

And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped

& I never get to lay back

'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs

some punk that I roughed up way back

comin' back after all these years

rat-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh

Intro: 2Pac
Black Cotton
Black Cotton

Black Cotton- A symbol for unrewarded struggle

Time for a little gospel tail

Ghetto gospel that is- listen

Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes

Speak



Verse One: 2Pac



Black Cotton

Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's

Class is in session the worst question is the first question

Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave

Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')

Answer that then answer this too-

Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true

You best to backtrack and try to act black and live

Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?

What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue

Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)

Dum dum diddy is it me?

Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets

If not peace then at least let's get a piece

I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased

Lookin' through my highschool yearbook

Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took

One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF

We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot

God come save the misbegotten

Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)



Chorus: Eminem



Nobody don't care

(No matter how hard I try/Look to the sky/--?)

Nobody don't care

(Seems like my dreams/Drowned in by screams/No answer to my questions)

Nobody don't care

(Feels like I'm pressed/Why do I stress?/It's like I'm being tested)

Nobody don't care

(Seems like my prayers/Vanish to thin air/Please answer my questions)

Nobody don't care



Kastro: Verse 3



In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up

Running out of luck, about to self destruct

Old heads say live your life like such

Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy

I wouldn't listen to 'em

Your power movement was cool

But it ain't fix nothin'

So I just go with what i know

I dont trust none

Look what the 80's did

To what's Bebe's kids

And now we grown up

Nobody ain't own us yet



Young Noble: Verse 4



Black cotton, I'm plottin' ---?

I'm workin' without a profit

They shacklin' all my homies

I'm hurtin' but keep the mind

?---No idea---?

certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas

What's the reward for a strugala

If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up

Runnin up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves 

If you aint got a penny, mind the glove

No love

Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze

Biblicle times good hearts with milita minds

Black Cotton - I'm hoppin' over enemy lines

Black Cotton - I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine

Black Cotton

Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last

Into the hills of gold

And peace to this young warrior

Without the sound of guns



If I could recollect before my hood days

I sit and reminisce, thinking of bliss and the good days

I stop and stare at the younger

My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under

And nowadays things change

Everyone's ashamed of the youth

cause the truth look strange

And for me it's reversed



We left 'em a world that's cursed and it hurts

Cause any day they'll push the button, and all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'

Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary

When you wipe your eyes see it clearly

There's no need for you to fear me

If you take your time and hear me

Maybe you can learn to cheer me

It ain't about black or white, cause we human

I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel



Those who wish to follow me

(Ghetto gospel)

I welcome with my hands

And the red sun sinks at last

Into the hills of gold

And peace to this young warrior

Without the sound of guns



Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?

Living out of bags plus she's glad for the little things

She has

And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy

Guess who's giving birth to a baby

I don't trip or let it fade me

From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery

Even now I get discouraged

Wonder if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?



I refuse to be a role model

I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles

I make mistakes but learn from every one

And when it's said and done

I bet this brother be a better one

If I upset you don't stress, never forget

That God isn't finished with me yet

I feel His hand on my brain

When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing

But am I less holy cause I chose to puff a blunt

And drink a beer with my homies?

Before we find world peace

We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets;

My ghetto gospel



Those who wish to follow me

(Yeah!, ghetto gospel)

I welcome with my hands

And the red sun sinks at last

Into the hills of gold

And peace to this young warrior

Without the sound of guns



Lord can you hear me speak....

To pay the price of being Hell bound"

Pac's life

(Everybody need's to chill)

Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life

(It's Tupac the king)

What do you know about Pac's life

(What do you know? What do you know?)

(Only real niggas stay on top)

Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life

(Outlawz)



(Verse One: Tupac)



Started with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him

Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million 

Hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits 

Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits 

Dodging cop cars look how we come so far 

Picture a high school drop out 

Rolling a double R 

House full of happiness, weed and drank 

Way out 

So when trouble tried to find me can't

Never visioned living longer than my twenty first 

Thought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt 

And though it hurts to see the change 

It comes with the fame 

Watch them gossip in this silly game 

To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night 

Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life?

To all y'all niggas

Conversating on my life

Mind your motherfucking business



(Chorus)



(Verse Two: T.I)



I remember that

Ay

What's happening Pac 

Yeah I know we never to meet

But we know all the same people so we got to speak

You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G

And all the shit you went through

Meant a lot to me

But when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see

You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me

I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be

Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me

And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see

Now they all in the court room blaming me

See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle

Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's

Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em

Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's

Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's

With the same sort of dude with he same short fuse



(Chorus)



(Verse Three: Tupac)



I want money in large amounts

My garage full of cars that bounce

Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts

Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks

They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump

They jump my automatic keep 'em weary

While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass

Nigga you scary

I been knowing you for years

We was high school peers

In Junior High

I was itching' to kill

And you was, 'Ready To Die'

While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases

Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places

Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried

Bitches die in a hurry

Still I ride, I'm never worried

Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride

Pick my enemies out the crowd

And motherfucker's die

It's not the way I wanna live

My nigga it's how it is

Only real niggas stay on top



(Chorus)



Why are all you niggas all up in my shit?

Tell them motherfucker's

Outlawz

Fuck all y'all

Young nation just trying to get this

Murderous mind state,

Can't keep my nine straight,

Sippin' on this Hennessy, waiting for the time to break,

Show up and muthafuckas bow down, recognize

Westside, Death Row, Outlaw, Ridaz,

Untouchable mob of pistol packers,

Well-known felons labeled for 'drug-selling merciless jackers',

Forever buzz, roll with thugs and dogs,

Commence the letting off rounds, then escape in the fog,

Who wants to see me solo?

Catch Makaveli while he sleeping,

My mini fourteen murdering niggaz while they creepin, (Uh)

Duck cause you ass out, 

Drink 'til you pass out,

Ain't scared to die, drunk driving in my glass house,

Niggaz is under me,

When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get,

Out the window on some uptown anthem shit,

I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure, I been here before,

Fugitive taskforce at my girlfriends' door,

Now they checkin' in her bedroom, I ain't there,

Forty Cals, extended clips, still I ain't scared,

Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive,

I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die,

You think God had a plan for me?

But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me,

Maybe I'm brazen or paranoid than a bitch, 

Me dyin', you think I'd let him see the joy from that shit?

Walking dead, angels spend their last days by me,

New Jersey Giant like Dave Tyree,

Young George or Jonathan Chat,

Your guns clap,

Mine will go 'br-r-r-r-att',

Soldier like Geronimo Pratt,

And come through cockin' tha black pound,

When they put the twin towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' 'em back down,

Poster child, 

Air Force Ones, with the checks,

I'm supposed to wild sex,

Money and murder is all I breathe in my life,

It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night,

Through the Henny, I see the eyes of the Devil, 

He's ridin' with extra boxes of bullets and a nina and a shovel

[Verse 3: Papoose]

I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac,

So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box,

You end up in the box 'cause them grave robbin' bastards,

Dig your grave up and snatched you out the casket,

Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage,

The flesh to the bones,

The bones to the ashes,

But I'm not dead,

I'm actually in a session with the Pac Keeper, Sha Money, progressing,

They don't really want no drama, I know they goons,

That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound,

This God given, he keep givin' me better music,

So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement,

Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin',

Songs of evolution,

If I load your gun for you and we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it,

Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever, stupid,

Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless,

You got the same bullets you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it,

The Nasareema dream, get ready for execution, 

Papoose, Fatal and Pac

The revolution



[Chorus: Carl Thomas]

Who you are,

One Nation under a thug and bullet scar,

Young nation, no revolution and no cause, 

One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,

Don't let it get ya

I wanna be legal

But it's this hustle that get me richer

One love to my peoples makin' money

I can see you bubblin'

Avoid all trouble

Beware of devils continue strugglin'

Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way

So get your mind on official business

You can be great

And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave

So get paid

My niggaz do this every fuckin' day

We parlay

Through politics and conversation

This information to my thug niggaz in the congregation

Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation

Separation is self destruction

What's needed is unification

Cause the world ain't hardly scared

If not prepared

Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there

But no one cares it's there to share

All we get is stares

Because of fear we'll evaporate

Say your prayers

Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane

Never will change niggaz wit' no name no shame

Might open ya head foe mess broke change

Starin' thru my rear view ballin' in a jag (jag)

Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town

We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now

Doin' what we gotta do to survive

Just ask Kweli doin' what we do to get by

Some niggaz stick to the crime

Pitchin' nickel and dimes

What the fuck we s'pose to do

Who gon' give us a job

So I tried and tried

Tried to get out the grind

But the block kept on callin' me back

Fiends kept on callin' for crack

So I supply 'em wit' that

Gave 'em a reasonable fee

Nigga don't blame it on me

Shit just look where I'm at

Niggaz in gardens

LAPD is the target

Niggaz is heartless hustle regardless

Look that dope spot use to be an apartment

But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet

Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet

We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin



Whatz next

Quit starin' at me like a infa red nigga
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep

Other niggaz close they eyes

Seein' dreams in they sleep

But don't fall asleep

Don't fall to sleep

You can get ya cash on



Pictures of penny

Sippin' my glass full of henny

Hands on my semi-

Automatic kill for pennies

Approach for contact

Cause I'm live I multiply

Soon as I open fire

Niggaz die wit' open eyes

Scare to take a nap

It's a trap a long maze

Dreamin' of gettin' stacks

Makin' scratch the wrong way

What the song say

We murder motherfuckers daily

Black out blow the crack out

My lyrics neva fail me

I inhale strong weed then release the stress

Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west

Like yay-yo

Niggaz pull out when I say so

Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy it fatal

'fficiently I delete then flee

The art of war

Livin' sucka free

Get wit' me

Motherfucker don't sleep



[Chorus x2: 2Pac]

Don't go to sleep

You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep

Other niggaz close they eyes

Seein' dreams in they sleep

But don't fall asleep



[Young Buck:]

I'm starin' thru my rear view

Doin' 'bout 90

The petal to the metal

So I can see what's behind me

Buckle up your seat belt eyes on the road

They know we ridin' dirty gotta play it how it go

They close down the projects the clubs been closed

And then they wonder why niggaz breakin down o's

I'm a run away slave

Ya get it nigga off the chain

I got that thug life shit runnin' thru my viens

And now they scare

They know that I been heaven sent

And yeah we know the dope comin' from the president

But look at us

We ain't got shit to lose

Feel like we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes

In the ghetto or better yet home sweet home

This is the land of the free

But to me that's wrong

I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat

So don't fall asleep



Come on niggaz



[Chorus x2]



[Chamillionaire:]

They say that the moe they hate ya the moe that it motivate ya

My mind set on grind my mental set on the paper

62 hours and countin' and I'm still awake

And they slippin' me sleepin' pills wit' the will I break

Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust

So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up

Red dotted the media cause they always mad at us

I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate when we get gats and bust

They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape

It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case

Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff

I'm takin' back my money counter cause it wasn't fast enough, yep

I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money

Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies

Sometimes I want to maneuver with the ruger

To live like Freddie Krueger these nightmares just ain't as buddy

In meetings they always askin' what my passion is

(And the) money talks so I always have words to answer this (yep)

I can't relax cause its like I'm a fetti activist

Might see me on tv never a mat-tress



[Chorus]



Don't go to sleep

Sleep banger

Soon As I Get Home, Soon As I Get Home
[Verse 1: 2Pac]

Dear baby its me again, stuck inside this packed pen

trying to pay my debt for all my sins

See this penitentiary time be so heavy on my mind

at times its like I'm living just to die

I'm living in hell, stuck in my jail cell, stranded in the county jail

waiting for my chance to post bail

I wanna be paid in large stacks, I mash so fast

I blast

wondering how long will I last

My memories fade when I'm intoxicated

busters be shady

so I'm dumping on cowards daily

we never faded

I know I said it all before but now I mean it

visions of you and me ballin, so crystal clear I seen it

Even though you mad at me you'll be glad to see the strategy

of making these chips come so easily

I max out in the morning baby, life is good

me and you against the whole world

Soon as I get home



[Chorus: 2Pac]

Grab my gat, locate my comrads

Lets get my enemies, not knowing I'm coming back

Go get the money out the safe

It's time to turn the streets to a war zone

Soon as I get home



[Verse 2: 2Pac]

Sittin here looking at pictures of you and me living

but now your out in the world, while I'm twisted in prison

Love letters come daily

words of perfection

you send me money and news clips, beggin for sex and..

Stay wide open, keep yours eyes peeled

in my advice you keep it real and they can die squealing

Plus I never have to worry about a visit, cause your there daily

guards trying to get your number, you don't dare tell me

Tongue kissing, steady humpin, trying to accomplish something

before the co. and the warden jump in, frontin

Late night reminiscing, everybody's quiet

I think something in the air, prepare for the riot

In padlocks and my socks, tied to the bed frame

I touch her thug love, but they got my head in pain

Started a war but now I'm gone

release me to the streets in the morning its on

Soon as I get home



[Chorus]



[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]

See you been gone my whole life, like a game a cee-lo

fulfilling your dreams on the streets like nino

Brown, the whole town be shook up

and me and momma surviving depends on how many rocks a nigga cook up

Narcotics is mastered, seen them niggas you blasted

wanting me in a casket, on the grind I'm faster

Yea nigga I heard, lil' moo gave me word

you get paroled on the 3rd,ill roll up we get served

We out here frontin, still don't care about nothin

rollin in my double r and Im trying to see somethin' we ain't never had

came from a life of living, learn the tricks of the trade

shit shoulda been taught by dad

But learned through the crew, that's just between me and you

and once we lock this shit down, ain't a thing they can do

Meanwhile I'll stay waiting by the phone

hoping I'll get the call, telling a nigga that you home.

After the fire comes the rain

After the pleasure there's pain

Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again

Time to make ya'll, my military be prepared for the busters similar to

Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em

Visions of over packed prisons

Million's of niggas thug living

Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us

So pull the heat out, ammunition in crate's (shh)

Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place

I'm sensing niggas is defenceless I'm hitting fence's then getting ghost

Who can prevent me shooting senseless?

At these niggas throats

Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through

Outlaws busting while we rushing

We untouchable

Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through

We Outlaws rushing you busting you

We untouchable

You niggas better not try to run up

And don't try to say we ain't told you

You're dealing with killers and soldiers

Nigga these explosives, trying to blow shit, running you over

Nigga controller

Whenever y'all niggas try to roll up

Thinking I'm a ho, well, come and let me show ya

I'm a light up the rhythm like dosia

Dumping so potent, nigga don't choke up

Flow up

Makaveli The Don, got niggas strapped and ready to bomb

As soon as I send the alarm, and when we're done

We've committed a red rum, leaving the enemies dead and gone

Leaving 'em niggas head's blown, cause they know they dead wrong

When the shots ring out you know we're coming through (Know we're coming through)

Talk a lot with your mouth, well what you gon' do? (So what you gon' do?)

Shut 'em down, busters be knowing to keep they distance

Thugs don't fuck around

We get back at 'em so swiftly, niggas is with me underground

Slug in a niggas mug, reppin' Midwest Side

Niggas if you a thug get your weapon, let's ride

Ride for Pac, Pac, get live for Pac, Pac, Pop off the Glock, Glock

The thugging it don't stop

(Verse Three: Tupac)



Only wish to breed

I explode into a million seeds

Ya'll remember me

Legendary live eternally

Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation

Niggas screaming peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em

Take them to places, stake they face then erase 'em and brake 'em

Murder motherfucker's at a rate and then quicken the pace

Blast me but never ask me to live a lie

Am I wrong cause I wanna get it on till I die?

(Westcoast)

Now I'm worldwide

Niggas gossip like girls then hide

No offence to Nas but this whole fucking world is mine

Even if you blind you can still see my prophecy

My destiny to overthrow those on top of me

Fiending for currency the money be calling

Can you feel me, dreaming?

Seeing scenes of me balling?

Fuck you bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through

Outlaws busting while we rushing

We untouchable

Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through

We Outlaws rushing you busting you

We untouchable

[Intro: Dat Nigga Daz]
Yeahhh, back up in yo ass with a twenty sack
Don't wanna fuck with me

(Dogg Pound Gangstaz)

We do it like that

Motherfuckers out there be like, takin our styles

Be trying to do they own little dissing

but they can't do it, you know

So we gonna, do it like this

Sit back relax and get a cool one



[Kurupt the Kingpin]

Have you ever heard of a slughter, I oughta start dippin

Sippin on that S-T get's me to trippin

I don't slips I bangs

with that mad ass Dogg Pound Gang it's a DPG thang

Kurupt from the S.C

You wanna test me let's see if you'll survive .45 times

Like a hollow point headed for your dome

Take a couple of steps, turn around and it's on

Couldn't withstand the murderous mental

I subdue, and then take two to your temple

when I cause holocoust from what's spittin

Niggaz collapse and when the straps is clickin

Look, this is how it's done nigga (one two three)

I grab my strap you best run nigga

I gives a fuck, Kurupt's the kingpin of the click

Littlest G, with the biggest dick



[Dat Nigga Daz]

Shit, a motherfucker betta recognize

With a twist of my wrist like O.J. you all die

I snack on motherfuckers like a bone

Known to be the shit upon the microphone ever since I was bown

Not to ever love a bitch

Learned game after game, that's why we are the best

Motherfuckers be gankin styles minute after minute

But soon as you did it I smelled the niggaz shitted



[Chorus x2: Daz, Snoop & Jewell]



Now what would you do?

If you could fuck with me and my crew



But you can't so don't even think about

steppin in the motherfuckin house



[Dat Nigga Daz]

Bitches butterfly all day, while I steady make my pay

Every single day in the LBC

Cruisin through the Eastside, me and Lil' Style

When I back up a green six-fo' bustin free styles



[Kurupt the Kingpin]

There's no escape, give me the papes and the tape case

How much money can a nigga make in one place?

The review, ain't shit new

You stupid motherfuckers can't fuck wit my crew



[Dat Nigga Daz]

I see all these niggaz tryin to get with my kin folk

Get so many busters on the West Coast

And then to say the least

I see a few trick ass niggaz layin low on the East Coast

And the question is asked

Do you wanna rap, scrap or blast to that nigga Daz

I'll be the first one to him em

Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knocckout and every nigga down with him

Cause I'm a Natural Born Killer

And I steal a half, motherfucker cuz it's like that



[Chorus: 1/2]



[Kurupt the Kingpin]

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include

Whose quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud

It doesn't make a difference, cuz it's about

who's the quickest on the draw to end all existence

For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools

These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room

Assume, it's only for conversation, so let's

conversate slip a nigga the .38 then dip

Empty out the clip

Mind on stead-trip, cuz niggaz talk shit



[Dat Nigga Daz]

Now if, a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died

Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive?

And if I was in your shoes, would I survive?

Probably not, you'd probably let your glock go pop

Now drop, to your knees

And picture Dat Nigga Daz (flowin) flowin in the breeze



[Chorus]



[Outro: Big Pimpin' Delemond, Jewell]



From the twitch of the eyes

You can see the line, just know it when you see it

Cause it messes up the flow, to the real fillings y'know

And I'd rather be sipping on a glass of wine

Can you feel yourself in the room with Everlast

Trying to steal a flow, I don't think so

Cock-blockers come with their hearts beating jealousy

In the way like a stray dog

Trying to climb, every bitch on his arm

Cock-blockers, come in every color

Even blue, now this is true

Trying to fuck your woman, and even you

Now what the fuck would you do, motherfucker?



What would you do? Mmm.

What would you do? What would you do?

What would you do?

If you could get with me and my crew

The weak ones stick and move

What would you do, if you could get, with my crew?

Why don't you tell me what 

tell me what you would do? If you could get with

The weak ones stick and move

What would you do, if you could get, with my crew?

me and my crew, with me and my crew

What would you do? What would you do?

What would you do, if you could get, with my crew?

What would you, what would you do

If you could get with the Dogg Pound?

What would you do?

Would you get caught with your pants down?

What would you do?

If you could get with the Dogg Pound?

What would you do?

Would you get caught with your pants down?

What would you do?

If you could get with the Dogg Pound?

What would you do?

If you get caught with your pants down?"

So what I'm gonna do, hopefully, is, I wanna be..
I-I don't wanna be I +am+, Tupac Shakur

{*vocal scratch: ""guess who's back"" - 4X*}



[2Pac - repeat 4X]

Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier

Everywhere I see, a soldier like me



[2Pac]

Posse deep as I roll through the streets

Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps

Layin so low you'd think I'm asleep

But at the slightest beef I'm robbin niggaz of they teeth

And OPD can get the dick if they play toughy

Last time them niggaz rushed me I ain't bust but now I'm touched

Trust me, ain't nuttin jumpin but these buckshots

A nigga's got enough knocks, I'm poppin at corrupt cops {*pow*}

Them motherfuckers catch a hot one

You wanted to start a problem now you coward cops have got one

And there's no prison that can hold ya

Motherfuck a soldier ready to roll or take control

So now I jack 'em while they sleepin

Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct {*pin, explosion*}

Some people panic, brothers bugged out

I had to keep poppin cause there's no stoppin 'til they rubbed out

And they vest don't protect from the head wounds

Reload ammunitions and them bitches will be dead soon {*boom*}

Smoke risin from the barrel of my shotty

I finally got revenge now count the bodies

Twenty cops, one for every year in jail

Tryin to keep a nigga down but you failed

Before I let you take me, I told ya

Fuck bein trapped, I'm a soldier



[Chorus: Eminem]

I betcha that's how I got some things you ain't got

that's called courage, and it don't come

from no flick or bottle, it ain't scotch

It's not bourbon, I don't walk around

like no G cause that ain't me

I'm not that person, I don't try

to act like you do cause that ain't you

You just burpin, you ain't



[2Pac]

2Pac in the mad bitch

In the six-fo' rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch

Gettin ghost on them bitches in the town

Bustin out the back seat nigga when we clown

Homey is you down? D got the strap and she anxious {*click*}

Hurry up 'fore she spank shit {*tires peeling*}

Comin 'round the corner spittin rounds, they can't hold me down

Caught them sucker-ass bitches outta bounds

Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate

Make 'em pray for the judgment day

Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate

Make 'em pray for the judgment day - stinkin beotch!

i aint the one you wanna try, why, stayin high

i hit the blunt an watch these motherfuckers die

whose runnin the streets i sell that cocaine

cause in the the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne

another hustler makin' major cash

'til the punk police come raid your ass

Chorus (x1)





Verse 3 - Outlawz (EDI & Young Noble)



They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants

this revolution wont be televised, we keep it silent (shh)

roll on our enemies, beat em' at they own game

molotov cocktails, releasing up in flames

tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back

lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' bout the pay back

wanna see my kids grow dont know if imma make it though

one more nigga came up short in the ghetto

society lied to me so im strapped with the metal

push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel

have ya face down goin in ya pockets if ya let em

i done lost too many homies for me to ever forget em

i done made so many mistakes but still i dont regret em

im a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend

im a product of the block, the fiends, and the felons

we all lost souls tryina find our way to heaven

Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last

Into the hills of gold

And peace to this young warrior

Without the sound of guns



If I could recollect before my hood days

I sit and reminisce, thinking of bliss and the good days

I stop and stare at the younger

My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under

And nowadays things change

Everyone's ashamed of the youth

cause the truth look strange

And for me it's reversed



We left 'em a world that's cursed and it hurts

Cause any day they'll push the button, and all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'

Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary

When you wipe your eyes see it clearly

There's no need for you to fear me

If you take your time and hear me

Maybe you can learn to cheer me

It ain't about black or white, cause we human

I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel



Those who wish to follow me

(Ghetto gospel)

I welcome with my hands

And the red sun sinks at last

Into the hills of gold

And peace to this young warrior

Without the sound of guns



Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?

Living out of bags plus she's glad for the little things

She has

And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy

Guess who's giving birth to a baby

I don't trip or let it fade me

From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery

Even now I get discouraged

Wonder if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?



I refuse to be a role model

I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles

I make mistakes but learn from every one

And when it's said and done

I bet this brother be a better one

If I upset you don't stress, never forget

That God isn't finished with me yet

I feel His hand on my brain

When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing

But am I less holy cause I chose to puff a blunt

And drink a beer with my homies?

Before we find world peace

We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets;

My ghetto gospel



Those who wish to follow me

(Yeah!, ghetto gospel)

I welcome with my hands

And the red sun sinks at last

Into the hills of gold

And peace to this young warrior

Without the sound of guns



Lord can you hear me speak....

To pay the price of being Hell bound"

Intro: 2Pac
Black Cotton
Black Cotton

Black Cotton- A symbol for unrewarded struggle

Time for a little gospel tail

Ghetto gospel that is- listen

Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes

Speak



Verse One: 2Pac



Black Cotton

Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's

Class is in session the worst question is the first question

Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave

Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')

Answer that then answer this too-

Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true

You best to backtrack and try to act black and live

Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?

What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue

Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)

Dum dum diddy is it me?

Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets

If not peace then at least let's get a piece

I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased

Lookin' through my highschool yearbook

Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took

One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF

We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot

God come save the misbegotten

Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)



Chorus: Eminem



Nobody don't care

(No matter how hard I try/Look to the sky/--?)

Nobody don't care

(Seems like my dreams/Drowned in by screams/No answer to my questions)

Nobody don't care

(Feels like I'm pressed/Why do I stress?/It's like I'm being tested)

Nobody don't care

(Seems like my prayers/Vanish to thin air/Please answer my questions)

Nobody don't care



Kastro: Verse 3



In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up

Running out of luck, about to self destruct

Old heads say live your life like such

Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy

I wouldn't listen to 'em

Your power movement was cool

But it ain't fix nothin'

So I just go with what i know

I dont trust none

Look what the 80's did

To what's Bebe's kids

And now we grown up

Nobody ain't own us yet



Young Noble: Verse 4



Black cotton, I'm plottin' ---?

I'm workin' without a profit

They shacklin' all my homies

I'm hurtin' but keep the mind

?---No idea---?

certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas

What's the reward for a strugala

If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up

Runnin up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves 

If you aint got a penny, mind the glove

No love

Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze

Biblicle times good hearts with milita minds

Black Cotton - I'm hoppin' over enemy lines

Black Cotton - I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine

Black Cotton

Now that it's poppin aint no love bitch

I maintain in the game, in the gutter is where I still kick it

I'm tryin to hustle up a meal ticket

I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler till my dying days

Aint nothin wrong with gettin paid

So nigga blaze, cuz we some motherfuckin fools

Walkin through the streets wearing jewels

Breakin niggaz, fakin moves

Even the cops can't stop us

My enemies flip when the see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy

Now let me tell 'em who I be



{Tupac}

Big ballin ass nigga named Trice



[Verse 2: Obie Trice]

Now I was born in Detroit on the side that's west

Troubled child, commin up I had to ride I guess

Tried to apply myself, but niggas was ballin

My momma couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin

I was often involved with niggaz breakin the law

I look back Pac nigga, we was bankin off raw

P Funk, got it pumpin, he had the connects

Through the sack to us little niggaz workin the set

And if you got it you getting wet, nigga bet on that

Don't come around hurr on that floss shit

Detroit niggaz off shit

(Robbin niggaz in the door ways) That's right

(With my 4-4, that's the sure way)

And this your old days, all eyez on me

We was loony I suppose you could (die homie)

O Trice always repped his block

Pass the Hen' and that Ice, I'm on a track with Pac nigga"

I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard 
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles 
[crowd starts chanting ""Tupac""]

Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz 

This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac 

Which, raises the question 

Where are these songs coming from? 

It's interesting how, the message in these songs 

Is still relevant today 

Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics 

I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight 

When the album will officially be released 

Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem

Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?

Real live black... ghosts

Feel me?



[Verse One: 2Pac]

Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me

Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies

Papa was a motherfuckin, joke

Used to find dope in his coat

And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke

Daaamn, don't get me started

My mama smoked so God damn much

when she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded

At night I can't sleep, can't peep

As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep

Starin at the wall, heard a scream

Wake up in the mornin

See the blood in the hall from the murder scene

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die

As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye

On the corner, where the niggaz slang they crack

And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back

(Five-OH!) I daydream about the dope world

Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl

My mausberg goes BOOM, what's another plug

Snatchin drugs, pumpin slugs in these other thugs

(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath

Every step could be death 'til you blast

And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost



[Chorus: 2Pac]

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die

As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die

As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye



[Verse Two: 2Pac]

A seven-deuce full of niggaz goes by

Thought I was trippin the second time they rolled, by

Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar

Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya

Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep

Let me die as I rest in peace, deep

Back to these niggaz in the seven-deuce

A mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do?

Run for cover and return fire

DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope yo' ass fry, don't ask why

But I let off everything I have

An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash

On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now

Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down

BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by

Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives

Don't know why but I'm runnin to my fuckin block

Took a shot, tired of runnin from the niggaz and the cops

Time to be a ghost

(HEY MAN, COME THE FUCK ON!)

And then we'll be ghost



[Chorus]

I ain't got nuttin on my mind, but gettin in some trouble

Lickin shots to they block leavin bloody blood puddles

for some ridah delight, now we in a gunfight

I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight

It's on me, but if I die bury me a motherfuckin G

A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me

With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece

Thug Life motherfucker gotta me runnin' from the police



Nigga, you know that's true

Catch a nigga like K-Dog, chillin wit a crew

Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re

The O.J. and it's all OK

'til that fuckin fake cop got to play the man

Ran me down the block with my glass in my hand

Damn, I hope it don't spill

Nigga chill, shit is real cock back my steel



Still runnin' from the police I gets no sleep

I got you peepin in my window while I'm smokin indo

But I ain't no motherfuckin track star, pig's got a Jeep

like Big Mouth, runnin through motherfucker's backyards

So I, grabs my piece before I flee

And instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me

Lick shots hits spots off on my piece

Cause a nigga like Big Mouth is through runnin' from the police



[Interlude: Buju Banton]

I bust off! What about the time they pull me from the Bronco

lay, they tried to cock me, but them can't gun store

When a batty bwoy do it from the mob

Ahh, pull up your pants then you screw an left squad

Look around, look around, punk police

While gwan man doesn't a come but a bad boy test

Look around, look around, punk police

Check it, I grew up a fuckin screw-up

Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up

Choppin rocks overnight

The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin to turn into the black Frank White

And we got the workers choppin rock, Benz by the flock

And we gettin it, the dirty cops are jealous so they sweatin it

I'm lettin off smoke, hope they don't play me for no joke

We keepin it real, fuck how you feel, Biggie pass the steel

Let's serve these motherfuckers slugs as a fuckin meal

We had to grow dreads to change our description

Two cops is on the milk box missin

Show they toes you know they got stepped on

Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat

I fuck around and catch a asthma attack (*heavy breathing*)

That's why I bust back, it don't phase me

Celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight

Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

Now it's war, me tryin to sell, runnin from the punk po-lice

They try to cock me, but them can't gun store

What about they come to hold up me North

Pulled up the park, I left school and left buck

Look around, look around, punk police

Was about to blast with ya gun but you can't stop me

Look around, look around, punk police

Me haf to blast back, cause blast back best



[2Pac]

They got me runnin' from the five-oh

duckin and dodgin in my survival

The Benzo and I let off with my nine, hoe

I'm movin swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex

Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next

Nigga, my homey slipped and now he pays the price

He did a driveby, sixteen, now he's doin triple life

Tell me is it me or my upbringin, I spit that thug shit

Nigga motherfuck singin, I hope you got your Timberlands

on tight, cause I ain't givin up

I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night

I'm runnin' through the projects, beyotch

They'll never catch me

Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy on the, sneotch

Don't say you never heard of me, til they murder me, I'm a legend

Do Thug Niggas go to heaven?

I'm rollin with the thorough heads

We gettin ghost on them hoes and yo

I got no love for the five-oh I'm runnin' from the police

[Thug Life]
Thinkin' back
reminiscing on my teens

a young G

getten' paid over dope fiends

fuckin' off cash that I make

nigga, what's tha sense of workin hard

if you never get tp play

i'm hustlen'

stayin' out till it's dawn

and commin' home

at 6 o'clock in tha mornin'

hand's on my glock

eye's on tha prize

finger on tha trigga when a nigga rides

shootin' craps

bustin' niggas out tha door

pick my money off tha floor

god bless tha tre-four

stuck on full, drunk again

sippin' on Gin

with a couple of friends

sayin' those thug life niggas be like major pimps

stickin' to tha rules is what made it simp

and if I die

let it be

but when they come for me

bury me a G



[Chorus x2 Tupac]



I ain't got time for bitches

Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches

even when I die

they won't worry me

mama don't cry

bury me a G



More Trouble than tha average

just made 25 and i'm livin' like a savage

bein a G ain't no easy thing

cause you could fuck around get crossed 

and get stuck in tha game

and for tha rest of your life you will sit and remineise

wonder why it had to end like this

and to tha G's you can feel my pain

till tha mothafuckas gets born again



you thought I was a game kid

i'm not tha nigga for playin games

I let my buckshots rang

when I pull tha trigga on my gauge

i'm on tha rampage

makin' runs for tha devil

ain't nothin' on my mind

will get me in some trouble

i'm tryin to ride 

no more loves 

for me hard to figure

get a nigga, smoke a blunt

Or is a jury starts (break that shit)

I gives a fuck nigga

stuck outta luck

when I bust

pull me to my death

but i'm a G to tha enemy



[Chorus x2 Tupac]



I ain't got time for bitches

gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches

even when I die

they won't worry me

mama don't cry

bury me a G



[Stretch]



I got nothen' ta loose so I choose to be a killer

went from bangin' ta slangin'

now i'm a dope dealer

all my life payed tha price to be tha boss

back in school

wrote tha rules on getten' tossed

poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time

pack a 9 all the time

you wanna test mine ?

don't cry

I die before they play me

from tha cradle to tha grave

bury me



Straight Thug G

kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood

getten' drunk, smokin' blunts

a bitch said I was no good

I gives a fuck

I spend my time in tha dope spot 

never had no time for no bitch 

instead slangin' rocks

and bustin' caps on you punk ass marcs

fake ass G's

bitch niggas with no heart

i'm stayin' real till i'm 6 feet deep

so when a nigga gone

bury me a G



[Chorus x2 Tupac]



I ain't got time for bitches

gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches

even when I die

they won't worry me

mama don't cry

Bury Me a G



[Tupac]



Stuck on Full

Tangaray got a nigga high

lord knows I don't need another DUI

I led a Thug Life

heartless hustler

just cause I fucked

don't mean I trust her

now my pagers vibratin'

can't sleep 

so i'm mobbin' to tha ho's house

pumpin' Isely

Is it cool ta fuck is what i'm askin

Bitch recognize game and start laughen

when i'm all in those guts and shit

prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick

cause i'll fuck and get up and let ya know

i'll be a 10 minute brotha for a $2 ho

lots a ho's get mad and shit

I let a trick be a trick

you can have that bitch

cause I doubt if I change

tha games a mothafucker

real niggas turn ta bustas

Bury Me a G



[Chorus x6 Tupac]



I ain't got time for bitches

Gotta Keep my mind on my mothafucken riches

even when I die

they won't worry me

Mama don't cry

[Chorus: x2]
All around the world,same song 
All all around the world same song 



[Shock G] 

I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on 

eat popcorn,watch you move your body to the pop song 

that I'm singing, dinga-linging, funky beats ringing 

everybody's swinging in the place

as I kick the J and easy is my style 

R&B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat

Champagne in my hand, it wont be long till I'm gone 

It's just the same old song 



[Humpty Hump] 

It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kickin 

sweat drippin, girlies in the limo eatin chicken 

oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose 

I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose 

Sneezin, but still I'm pleasin to all the slimmies

Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny 

if it's good and plenty, dont you know 

there I go, there I go, there I go 

But I dont go nowhere without my jim hat 

If I'm rappin, cause she's clappin

then I'm strappin cause I'm smarter than that 

then girlie maybe we can get along

Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song 



[Chorus: x3]



[Money B]

Money B, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky up and down

as a matter of fact ill be right back i gotta take a leak

So I'm drainin entertainin, but I got fame

and the bases I touch to much for me tryin to be namin

Aiyyo, you saw me on cable and gip 

I busted in and I was goin legit

Clark Gable back in Pakland its the same old song 

sport these shorties, same freckles and hat

drinkin the same 40's



[Humpty Hump]

hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip 

just like butter, my ryhmes are legit

Cause I'm the humpty. not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump 

here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump 



[Shock G] 

ah shut up and just listen 

not dissin dont get me wrong 

but to me its just the same old song 

so just watch, my name is shock, and i like to rock

and you cant stop this 

2Pac go ahead and rock this



[2Pac]

Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground 

Girls use to frown, say I'm down, when I come around 

gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me

harrass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me

Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high 

same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy

(clamin that they must have changed,just because we came strong)

I remain, still the same (why Tu'?) cause it's the same song

As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see

The American Dream wasn't meant for me

Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me

Promised me freedom, education, equality

Never gave me nothing but slavery

And now look at how dangerous you made me

Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold

With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told

Promise me emancipation indispute nation

All you gave my people was our patience

Fathers of our country never cared for me

They kept my answer shackled up in slavery

And Uncle Sam never did a dam thing for me

Except lie about the facts in my history

So now I'm sitting hear mad cause I'm unemployed

But the government's glad cause they enjoyed

When my people are down so they can screw us around

Time to change the government now panther power



[Chorus]

Panther power

Panther power

Panther power



[Tyson]

Coming straight that resides within

Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win

Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest

The rich get richer and the poor can't last

The American Dream was an American nightmare

You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair

The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out

Besides drew they know no blacks allowed

With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom

But now were impatient

Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs

Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out

""Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are

It's ya panther power that makes you a star""

Panther power



[Chorus]

Panther power

Panther power

Panther power



[Tupac]

My Mother never let me forget my history

Hoping I was set free chains never put on me

Wanted to be more than just free

Had to know the true facts about my history

I couldn't settle for being a statistic

Couldn't survive in this capitalistic

Government cause it was meant to hold us back

Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack

In my community think of unity

But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity

I strike America like a case of hard disease

Panther power is running through my arteries

Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death

Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath

Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?

You think you living free don't let me laugh at you

Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains

Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name

Cause some time has passed seem you all forget

There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet

Panter power



[Chorus]

Panther power

but no.
[Tupac]
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block.

Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks.

And I'm totin' these thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked.

And niggas laugh, til' tha first mothafucka got blasted.

I put the nigga in his casket,

Now they coverin' the bastard in plastic.

I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts. 

I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce.

And gettin' lost on the five-o, fuck them hos.

Got a 45 screamin' about survival.

Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo.

Hollar ""one-time"" when I say so.

Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences.

Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.

And they say how do you survive weighin' 165

In a city where the skinny niggas die?

Tell Mama don't cry.

Even when they kill me,

They can never take the game from a young G.

I'm st8 ballin'!



St8 ballin'!



Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'

pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it.

But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'.

It's kinda boomin' and today I'll make a killin'.

Dressin' down like a villian', but only on the block.

It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops.

Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends.

I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz.

I hate to stip let my music bump,

Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck.

Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal

As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo.

A need money in a major way.

Time to fuck my BEEEYATCH!! Hey!, and getten' paid

You other mothafuckas callin',

But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas,

We st8 ballin'!!



St8 ballin'!



Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do.

So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP!

But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes

Young nigga time to do or die.

I keep a pistol in my pocket,

Ready on my block.

Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit.

And now they see that mothafucka beat pain,

At point blank range cause he slept on the game.

Ain't a damned thing changed

Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em,

If you can't stand pain better hold 'em.

Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.

You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga.

Better live your life to the fullest,

You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it.

Cause even when they kill me, 

they can never take the game from a young G.

We st8 ballin'!



We st8 ballin'!



To my niggas in the penitentiary,

Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me.

Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born,

And once again it's on, 

I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone.

Who the hell can you get to stop me?

I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse.

I keep my glock cocked

I need it cause they're all shady.

I finally made it 

now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me!

I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back.

I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack.

And I came up a long way from food stamps.

And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps.

Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire.

What could I do? Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die.

I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs.

I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs.

And mothafucka, we be ballin'!

All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong!

We st8 ballin'"

Good Evening [sirens in the background]
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard 
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles 
[crowd starts chanting ""Tupac""]

Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz 

This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac 

Which, raises the question 

Where are these songs coming from? 

It's interesting how, the message in these songs 

Is still relevant today 

Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics 

I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight 

When the album will officially be released 

Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

[2Pac]
Haha, for all my niggaz in the hood (yeah)
That live the life of a ghetto star
(You KNOW!) Heh, you know how we do it

(Hahaha, Makaveli!)



[Verse One: 2Pac]

Just holla my name and witness game official

Niggaz is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches

While I remain inside a paradox called my block

Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?

I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high

Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn'ta tried

I send they bodies to they parents up North

With they faces laid bris and they nuts cut off

Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues

Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come

Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter

Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter, eat a dick BEYOTCH!

Mercy, never that, you say you comin back?

Bring it on, fo' whoever strapped

Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far

Just sell me your soul, and live the life.. (of a ghetto star)



[Verse Two: Nutso]

I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin game tight

Mug niggaz, slug niggaz for the fame life

Laced with game, practice on takin pain

Quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain

Street smart, proficient, intelligent

And keep suckers hittin 'til snitches start smellin it

Movin niggaz with telekenesis

Keepin Channel 7 at work, filmin different features

Leadin niggaz to an early death with they head blown

And to those who didn't make it to the morgue was just dead and gone

And hope niggaz got punished

Kidnapped, jacked in the back with macs to they neck

Rappers waitin to get done in

Backtalkin - we tossed his ass out

M.O.B. related, one mo' nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth

Printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin G

Now the next generation's lookin at me through {*can't decipher*}



[Verse Three: 2Pac - overlaps Verse Two]

Walkin through the cemetary

Talkin to my homies that was buried

See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me

Please give me shelter, calm my fears

Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears

I see bodies gettin splashed, with acid

Two shots rang from the plastic glock, wrapped in plastic

Buried the bastard, time to notify, his family

Sheeit, ain't nuttin left to be identified

Evacuate the crime scene fast

Why I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass

Why, I won't touch down 'til I see Tiajuana

Set up shop sellin them crooked cops marijuana

Label me a success, I made the switch

Retired from the life that never gave me shit

With cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars

An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star



[Verse Four: Nutso]

Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this

Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip

No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down

Straight to the morgue cause I plan on, shuttin shit down

Born soldiers! -- Fucked him up with a mac-fo'

Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder

And a vest couldn't protect that flesh

Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest

Death, apparently they wasn't sucka free

Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggaz in protective custody

I guess they heard that I got them birds

Thought I was a nerd 'til I bucked one of them to the curb

Luxury livin lavish, with dreams of dyin rich

With a team and clientele on my motherfuckin dick

And gettin down on these snitch bitches, protectin riches

By givin stitches, the life as a ghetto star



When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)

When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)

When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)

When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)

When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)

When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)



[Outro: 2Pac w/ Nutso talking in background]

This goes out to all you motherfuckers

that STILL, have to kill to make that money

All you niggaz on the block, sellin rocks

Hand to hand, runnin from the police

I see you - live your life as a ghetto star!

Talk to the hood, claimin you gettin riches

Runnin from the flags.. live my life as a ghetto star

Niggaz with two strikes that don't wanna see the third, I feel you

It's the Don Makaveli - live my life as a ghetto star {*fades out*}"

[Intro: Nas]
I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner

Come on this journey

The best journey

Acres of land and swimming pools and all that

Check it out



[Verson One: Nas]

I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings

To fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things

Kids walkin' home from school on drug block missionaries

Pass out papers that read: Love God

See faces, cases, judges, juries, masons, lawyers and cops

I watch because every thugs face is my mirror

But this was one in particular 

This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro

16 years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go

Every mornin calls his comrad to come and get him to smoke

He insane, already gone mad

Blames himself for his setbacks

Dangerous street corners where his sets at

Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs

Chasin' him, his ass was flarin'

Smokin' like a chimney, on really, of course he not carin'

He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'

I give him a helpin' hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion



[Chorus: J. Phoenix]

Every corner, every city

There's a place where life's a little easy

Little Hennessy, laid back and cool

Every hour, cause it's all good

Leave all the stress from the world outside

Every wrong done will be alright 

Nothin but peace, love 

And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion



[Verse Two: 2Pac]

Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good

Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods

Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook

Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke

Then some lady named Billie Holiday

Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came

Little LaTasha sho' grown

Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home

Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us

When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band

Just think of all the people that you knew in the past

that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last

Picture a place that they exist, together

There has to be a place better than this, in heaven

So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin

Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion



[Chorus]



[Verse Three: Nas]

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide

Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by

No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets

No reason, for nobody's momma to cry

See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter

But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her

This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me

Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe

Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin

I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother

And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy

I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur

Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war

And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more

Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavnly champagne

What angels saw, with golden wings in thug's mansion



[Chorus]"

Better dayz 
Heeyyy 
Better dayz 
Got me thinking bout better dayz 

Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz 

Heeyy 

Better dayz 

Got me thinking bout better dayz 



[Verse 1] 



Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live 

Smoking weed like it ain't no thang, so even kids wanna try now 

Then lie down and get ran through 

Nobody watches them clocking, the evil men do 

Faced with the demons, addicted to hearing victims screaming 

Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens 

Cause even our birthdays, are cursed days 

A born thug in the first place, the worst ways 

I'd love to see the block in peace 

With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beasts 

And only we can change, it's up to us to clean up the streets 

It ain't the same 

Too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears 

Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years 

Pass by his family but what could I say? 

Keep your head up and try to keep the faith 

And pray for better dayz 



[Chorus] 



Better dayz, Better dayz 

Heeyyy 

Better dayz 

Thinking bout better dayz 

Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz 

Heeyy 

Better dayz 

Got me thinking bout better dayz 



[Verse 2] 



Thinking back as an adolescent 

Who would have guessed, that in my future years I'd be stressing 

Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted 

Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with 

Trying to keep my head up and stay strong 

All my homies slanging yayo all day long 

But they wrong, so I'm solo (so low) and so broke 

Saving up for some Jordan's, cause they dope 

I got a girl and I love her but she broke too 

And so am I, I can't take her to the place she wanna go to 

So we argue and playfight, all day and night 

Making passionate love till the day light 

Plus we bout to get evicted, can't pay the rent 

Guess it's time to see who really is your friend 

You tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed 

So many blessings while we stressing 

Looking for them better dayz 



Better dayz 



[Chorus] 



Better dayz, Better dayz 

Heeyyy 

Better dayz 

(Oh, better dayz) 

Thinking bout better dayz 

(I'm looking for better) 

Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz 

Heeyy 

Better dayz 

(Oh, better dayz) 

Got me thinking bout better dayz 



[Verse 3] 



Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools 

Since back in high school we was true, me and you 

Only part of us separated we stay faded 

Affiliated with gang bangers and still made it 

Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him 

Still dressing like grown men, when roll-ing 

Out in the dark, smoking newports, gaming marks 

Gotta place in my heart, homie stay smart 

Locked you up in the pen and gave you 3 to 10 

I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends 

Hoping you well, I know it's hell 

Doing time in the cell you need mail, when you in jail 

And me I'm doing cool 

I've settled down had a family, working and night school 

Every once in awhile, I reminisce 

And wonder how we ever came to this 

I miss the better dayz 



Better dayz, Better dayz 

Heeyyy 

Better dayz 

Thinking bout better dayz 

Better dayz, Better dayz, Better dayz 

Heeyy 

Better dayz 

Got me thinking bout better dayz 



(Chorus to Fade) 



I send this one out, to all the homeboys down in uh Clinton, locked down 

Rikers Island, all them dudes I was uh locked up with 

E block, F block L I H 

N I C in Rikers Island 

Downstate

[Verse 1: Tupac] 



Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme [echo] 

Introduce a drug called crack 

To us ghetto teens [echo] 

Got a law for raw niggas now 

Playa what it be like? [echo] 

When will niggas see they got us bleeding with 3 strikes [echo] 

Can't seem to focus 

Hopeless 

With violent thoughts 

I wrote this 

Got these devils petrified 

Hiding from my hocus pocus 

And so I learned to earn my currency 

And over time [echo] 

Affiliated 

Clearly click a military mind [echo] 

May god forgive us 

Though we dwell inside a paradox 

Thugged out and drug dealing 

>From the womb to the block [echo] 

My live mind got me surviving 5 shots [echo] 

My 45 got me fortified with live rounds 

When shit stick 

We plot hits 

When our block spits 

All hail 

Out on bail 

Wrath of 2pacalypse [echo] 

Forever ghetto 

Necessary picture food stamps 

Outlaw thug niggas 

Never left the boot camp 



[Verse 2: BuckShot & Cocoa Brovas] 



I'm a nigga for assignment 

One of the suqads finest [echo] 

Skilled in gorilla warfare 

And blessed 

Work with firearm [echo] 

My rap shit 

Contains sections of bomb sessions 

Says I'm responsible for black smith and wessons [echo] 

Putting up on ?? in the military state of mind [echo] 

Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined 

Cocoa Brovas pan the borderline [echo] 

That's the sound and your dead son 



Man to man 

I'm facing the devil with a plan [echo] 

Judo stance 

First glance 

I'm making my advance [echo] 

Animal instincts 

Intelligence of an assassin [echo] 

Mask my ninja style 

Surround me ready to attack [echo] 

I react swiftly 

What father taught me sticks with me [echo] 

Never forget the methods stick and move strictly [echo] 

Shit be seeming like its closing in 

With no regrets I hold position 

Cause I circles 

I'm one of the chosen men [echo] 



Picture being put in position to move [echo] 

And you can't move 

Cause your move is blocked by the knight at 12 O'clock 

That's when the madness beings [echo] 

So I start to focusing 

My thoughts on the war 

Cause the rule is the law [echo] 

And the law that we live by is to stay true to self 

In this case beady eye [echo] 

Why try 

Everybody lie 

About the block 

True soldier mentality 

This is how we rock and move [echo] 



Stick and move 

Time to show what kinda nigga 

Move or get moved on 

Lets see whos strong [echo] 



In the days of the strange 

Where nothing stays the same 

With new faces come through with similar game [echo] 

And who you thought them 

Really ain't they (echo) 

Catching deja vu 

Of the game people play [echo] 

It's a call for re-adjustment 

Fine tune your positions 

You slipping and tripping 

Instead of bobbing and dipping [echo] 

Will never let this world of stress get me [echo] 

Taking breathing techniques 

Slay you with tai chi [echo] 



What did you change 

To get a break 

In the world of snakes 

And those who fake 

Elimination I'm facing 

Destruction 

Outlaw till I duck down [echo] 

From po po's bustin' 

No one to trust in 

Rushing to the goal line 

Catch a nigga 

Beat him 

Treat him like he stole mine [echo] 

No swine 

I'm a soldier 

Told cha I control mine [echo] 

Time to take you back into time 

Follow this here 



One way out 

This black hole 

For this black soul 

Shit is outta control 

I'm fighting for my position 

To be a fetus in this world I am entering [echo] 

And my face is sentencing for repentance [echo] 

Before my body was fully formed into a human [echo] 

I was already consuming weed 

Cause my mom's use to smoke back in the 70's [echo] 

Maybe that's why in the 90's 

I drop g's when I drop degrees [echo] 

When I ease across the block 

With Pac [echo] 

And got all you niggas shot 

You didn't think 

Boot Camp click would link 

With the outlaw minded 

If you do you press rewind 

And you can peep gorilla tactics in every line 



[Tupac] 



Yeah 

And this is how we do it 

Where my real thugs? 

Where they at? 

Let me see my real thugs

C'mon c'mon

One thing we all adore 

Something worth dying for 

Nothing but pain 

Stuck in this game 

Searching for fortune and fame 



The one thing we all adore 

Something worth dying for 

It's been nothing but pain 

Stuck in this game 

Searching for fortune and fame 



[Verse 1: 2Pac] 

Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to g's 

Stresses after battle with success comes greed (echo) 

They got me hot When they shot me 

Plotted my revenge 

To increase my ends 

Enemies gettin dropped 

Win or lose 

Red or blue 

We must all stay true 

Play the game nigga 

Never let the game play you 

And for the fame 

Niggas change fast 

That's a shame 

What's the game 

Lost souls 

Who controls our brain? 

Who can I blame? 

The world seems strange at times 

Somewhat insane 

I'm hoping we can change with time 

I'm living blinded 

Searching for refinement 

Curse, I know death follows me 

But I murder him first 

And worse yet 

With each breathe 

Steps I take 

Breathless 

Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 

Cigar ashes 

Coaster 

Crystal glasses 

We mash on them jealous bastards 

With a ski mask 

I'm the first one to warn them 

Blast it 

Wrapped in plastic 

Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws) 

Ain't nothing left now 

Treated like a stepchild 

Was not for me 

Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck em all) 

Be rocking beats 

Fake in fame 



[Verse 2: Kadafi] 

Block run and shoot slugs 

We throw them back like hardballs 

Without the gloves 

No love for these fake desperados 

And thugs I bleed to envy 

Smoke and blow out they blunts 

Sipping Henney 

Drunk nights 

And hot days 

Cocking my heat shooting it sideways 

A wife on the run 

Full of common blunts 

Unconditionally married 

To my gun 

Fulfillin' my destiny 

On knees 

And ones desires 

Be pulling all my cabbage like priors 

Stuck in the trance searching for something higher 

Fortune and fame 



[Chorus] 



[Verse 3: Kastro] 

Searching for fortune and fame 

Lost in the rain 

A lose of the game 

With life the cost of the game 

We forcing the change 

Mother fuck flossing the chain (echo) 

All the blame 

Belongs to the part of the brain (echo) 

That we never use nigga 

Plus my heart is in pain (echo) 

And if I ever lose homey 

Bet I'm at it again (echo) 

Outlaws don't die 

So united we stand (echo) 

And if family come before 

All the fortune and fame (echo) 



[Verse 4: Napoleon] 

As I walk up in the crib 

Laid to rest me head 

Say some rhymes to angels 

Hope they bless my bed 

Hope they bless me the righteous way 

Got a homie locked down 

Outta town 

I sent him a kite today 

Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog 

Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog 

I was passed down the street fame 

Like glocks clocked and keep aim 

Was raised up with a clock box 

And I ran with the local street gang 

They say the light is faded 

But still shine in the dark 

You can easy been a man 

But you is a boy in your heart 

And that's some game that I got 

From generation of game 

In the road of life dog 

We need to switch up lanes 

Think about it 



[Chorus] 



[Verse 5: Young Noble] 

I can't complain 

I've seen my fair share of the fame 

It wont change me 

Now I've got this piece of change 

I feel strange I got so use to the hood 

That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good 

I was just a baby still retarded from slavery 

When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me 

Ghetto ain't made me I made myself 

Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help 

I pray for my health my mind and my family too 

State of myself my grind and my family crew 

Where one hand watches the other 

No we ain't blood 

But we still real brothers 

The struggle is real 

Nothing can steal 

What we build 

And that remains the same 

'Till that day we killed 

And that's real 

Life that I was aimed to be 

Love by my family tree 

That's fame to me 

How about it

My ghetto love song, hahaha, let's be friends..
(Where my niggaz at? Where my niggaz where my bitches?
Where my niggaz at? Where my bitches at?
Throw your hands in the air
Everybody just throw your hands in the air) 

Let's be friends..

(Wessyde in this motherfucker right here, Wessyde..)



[2Pac]

Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted

As you pass bye wink in my eye, freshly scented

What's the haps baby? (Whassup?) Come get with me and perhaps lady

you can help me multiply my stacks baby

Currency seems small I need companionship (hey)

Through with that - scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit

So why you hesitatin actin like yo' shit don't stink

Check out my - diamonds bitch everyone gonna blink (bling bling bling)

This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches

Cream dreamin motherfucker, on a mash for bitches

Check my resume, sippin on Cristal and Alize

Smokin on big weed, keyed the Cali way

Don't like trickin but I'll buy you a fifth

I can't stand no sneaker-wearin nappy head bitch

Let my pedigree, re-breed me, they're so cheap

Puttin bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief

Mash on my so-called comp, who the man?

While I'm tuggin on yo' main bitch head (C'mere baby, Wessyde!)

Understand this, ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z

He broke and I smoke daily (come on y'all) baby let's be friends



[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]

Let's be friends (where my niggaz at? come on)

You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your

friends.. (all my niggaz, where my hoes at?)

Why you trickin on them other hoes?

Let's be friends (where the bitches at, where the niggaz with money?)

(where you at baby?)

You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your

friends.. (cash makin hoes)

Why you trickin on them other hoes?

Let's be friends



[2pac]

I met you and I stuttered in passion

Though slightly blinded by that ass

It was hard to keep my dick in my pants

Every time you pass got me checkin for you hardcore; starin and watchin

Me and you one on one (see that bitch) picture countless options

Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me

Erotic, psychotic, we posess bubonics

Far from a crush I wanna bust your guts and touch

everything inside you from my head to my nuts

You got me sweatin like a fat girl goin for mine

Just a skinny nigga fuckin like she stole my mind

Back in time I recall how she used to be

I guess money and fame made you used to me

What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag

Fuck Dre, tell that bitch he can kiss my ass

Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen

Got my hands on your thighs now

Let me in between as friends



[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]

Let's be friends (wessyde, motherfucker right here)

You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your

friends.. (wessyde in this motherfucker)

Why you trickin on them other hoes?

Let's be friends (wessyde in this motherfucker right here)

You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your

friends.. (in this motherfucker right here)

Why you trickin on them other hoes?

Let's be friends



[2Pac]

Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks

I got em ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch (Ha hah!)

Was it me or the fame? My dick or the game?

Bet I scream WESSYDE when I came (wessyde, ha ha ha)

Scream my name, cause baby it's delicious got a weak spot

for pretty bitches up and down, similar to switches

My movement, baby let your back get into it

Make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it

You got me high! Let me come inside!

I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride! (let me ride!)

Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?

Fuck player hatin niggaz cause they cock block (cock block)

You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?

Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?

Made a livin out of cuss words, liquor, and weed

A bad seed turned good - in this world of G's

Baby got me fantasizin, seein you naked

It's the fuck song, so check my record

And let's be friends

(Where my niggaz at? Show me where my niggaz at?

Where my bitches at) Thug style!



[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]

Let's be friends (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)

(Throw yo' guns in the air!)

Friends.. (my ghetto love song, it goes on and on and on and on)

Let's be friends (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)

(Where my niggaz at?)

Friends.. (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)

(Where my people at? Let's be..)



[2Pac]

Where my people at? Show me where my people at

Where my people at? Show me where my people at

All my niggaz now, just my niggaz come

Where my niggaz at? Just my niggaz now

Be friends, tell me where my niggaz at

Be friends, tell me where my bitches at

Be friends, tell me where my people at

Be friends, tell me where my bitches at

Make money, take money, be friends



[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]

Let's be friends (get your cash on, let's, get dough)

You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your

friends.. (c'mon, get your cash on)

Why you trickin on them other hoes?

Let's be friends (c'mon, get your cash on, let's, get paid)

You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your

friends.. (c'mon, getcha cash on)

Why you trickin on them other hoes?

My lil' homies..
Everybody duckin, my fuckin lil' homies
[2Pac]

Just pay attention

Here's a story bout my lil' homies, straight thuggin

Lil' bad young mothafuckers, gotta love him

You catch him in his G ride, touchin his glock

Screamin Outlaw (Wessyde motherfucker) bustin on my enemy's block

Educated on these cold streets

Gettin money makin dummies out the police, ain't no peace

for an adolescent nigga to rap, so be a thinker

Bud smokin twenty-four seven, everyday drinker

Got my diploma but I never learned shit in school

Mo' money, mo' bitches, mo' murder fool

Always the young niggaz gettin in shit

She wouldn't stop to conversate so you called her a bitch (BIATCH)

Bustin on paper thin motherfuckers

Drinkin gin 'fore youu get to sinnin on them busters

Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me

Everybody duckin, my fuckin lil' homies



[Chorus: repeat 2X]

Lil' homies on the ride

Niggaz gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight

(my lil' homies)

Lil' homies on the mash

Runnin from these punk police, cause lil' niggaz run the sreets

(my fuckin lil' homies)



[2Pac]

I remember.. when you was just a lil' G

Flirting with death, playin Russian Roulette, screamin KILL ME!

Hey there young nigga, what you smokin on?

Mad at the world cause you came from a broken home

Love to squad plus your mob is sick

A bunch of adolescent niggaz spittin major shit

Tell me, young nigga if ya die let me know

Would your heart feel pain, watchin as your mother cries?

Will all your homies ride?

Or will they all get high, and talk about how you died?

Young niggaz on a mission to compete

Gettin G's, packin heat, bringin havoc to the fuckin streets

Nobody knows why he took a fo'-fo'

and loaded up on the whole front row (BUCK BUCK, BUCK BUCK!!)

Try to tell him but he act like he don't know me

Pull out his pistol and show me, my lil' homie



[Chorus]



[2Pac - over Chorus]

Hahaha, whassup nigga? YEAH!

You lil' bad motherfuckers

You motherfuckers know what time it is

Yeah nigga!

Juvenile delinquent-ass motherfuckers

Under eighteen.. better protect that shit!



[2Pac]

First to bomb, sixteen on death row

Bustin on them phony motherfuckers cause the big homey said so

Niggaz knew I was a nut case, quick to blast

Livin underage, but he'll blaze on yo' bitch ass

Is there a heaven for a G?

And if it is, will I finally get to be at peace?

On these streets ain't no peace, shell-shocked souls

makin money off of crack sales, young black males

Unable to change cause it's a cycle

Plus nobody knows.. the evil that they might do

Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K. Kastro

Big mouth Hussein, call them Outlawz

Tellin the world to be equipped

When these young motherfuckers rip shit, they don't quit

Drew down on me, pull a pound on me

Bust like he didn't know me, my lil' homies



[Chorus]



[2Pac - over Chorus]

Whassup nigga let's do this shit! My lil' homies!

Lil' bad-ass motherfuckin adolescent niggaz! My lil' homies!

What the fuck you niggaz wanna do? WHAT NIGGA? My fuckin lil' homies

Sixteen, fifteen, thirteen, my fuckin lil' homies



[Chorus]



[2Pac - over Chorus]

Juvenile delinquents ready to BUST on you motherfuckers

What the fuck you niggaz wanna do nigga?!

Nigga take yo' shit on, lil' homies!

We robbin motherfuckers nigga, Thug Life, Outlawwwwz! Wessyde!

I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin insane

I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang

Now tell if I'm wrong

but sayin ""Fuck the world"" got you deeper in my songs

Drinkin 'til I earl, spendin money 'til it's gone

It's the good life - maybe niggaz got it goin on

Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack

Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped

Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch

Bad Boy niggaz eat a dick a day, bumpin this

Lord have mercy it's a slaughter

So wicked that my tracks is wettin niggaz like it's water

I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights

But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life



[Chorus]

This is the good life, fuck my foes

God bless the dumb niggaz that, trust them hoes

Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise

and live the good life, cause thug niggaz don't die

We live the good life, fuck my foes

God bless the dumb niggaz that, trust these hoes

Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise

and live the good life, cause thug niggaz don't die



[Big Syke]

No one knows what the, future holds, but you

Haha.. listen close

They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind

Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind

My after time is narrow, peepin down the barrel of a foe

Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so

who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?

Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone

Send me home all alone in these cold streets

In desperation constantly drinkin and I can't sleep

Neck deep strugglin tryin to survive

SOme wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize

Let me modify this whole region

I declare this sucker duckin season, give me the reason

why I should change, into a softie

.. after living so loftily

It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world

Me, my niggaz, and my girl - livin the good life!



[Chorus]



[E.D.I.]

I spend my days and nights not knowin if, strays in flight

gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?

Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up

Last night we off the hook, doin way too much

But it's the fast lane only, big dealin big ceiling

All for the money, some kill some squeal

All for the money, most ain't even real

but we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?

Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game

I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain

Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin

Better start to get to runnin 'fore my click get to gunnin

Still in the midst of all the stress and pain

I'm still tryin to get a hold of the game, livin that good life

Hittin corners in my Chevy Surburban

Bless me Father I'ma sinner, I'm livin in hell

Just let me live on the streets, cause ain't no peace for me in jail

Gettin world-wide exposure

with a bunch of niggaz that don't give a FUCK, ridin as my soldiers

Now we was raised, ""Fuck this life,"" I rose my right

Holdin on a tight grip with death in my sight

And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleepwalkin as a true

Walk around town with a pound full of, bitter food

Came a long way from my born day, dead away where there's war play

Fuck friends I'll say, rather die for my A-K

with these fag-ass niggaz, see-through glass ass niggaz

Only ride my dick and the skin of my mash-ass niggaz

Breathin!

Uhh, I walk around with a knife in my back

Talkin bout a bad day, I live a life like that

It's unfair, and I'm losin my hair, blastin hooligans

Catch me, I'm fallin out flat, yo I'm ruined and

breathin in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me

I leaned to like it like that, when I was still in mommy

The side of seedy that the devil run from

In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from

And still I'm breathin!

And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this

Just lost two of my closest na'r one of y'all can take this

But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain

We number one motherfucker bout to do it again

Shit, 'Pac still doin it, you hoes can't ruin it

Two million everytime he drop I know you fuckers losin it

We movin in - for the kill, for a meal, holdin steel

Hold the wheel I'm bout to give these niggaz somethin they can feel

Fakin real, but we the raw and uncut

Style-bitin thug lyin niggaz, give it up!

[2Pac]

Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers

Just another lost soul, stuck, callin Jehovah

Outlaw 'til it's over, brand as my strap

Back like a cobra, I stay drunk, cause I'm a mad man

Whenever sober, on a one man mission

My ambition to hold up the rap game

While I pluck holes in niggaz like donuts

And still down to die for all my souljas

Like hillbillies, they don't fear me

So refuse bringin war to the city

With each breath, death before dishonor

Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor

A general in war, I'm the first to bomb

With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit heavily armed

I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question Hussein

Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game

I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me

I take the figure of dirty niggaz, who all got me

While bitches wonderin who shot me

No love, keep a grudge, shootin sluggs like Muammar Quadaffi

Murder my friends, build a new posse

We takin shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga like Rocky

You got a lot of nerve to play me

Another gay rapper, bustin caps to Jay-Z

(buck buck buck buck buck buck)

And still avoid capture, while y'all caught up in the rapture

Still after me, I'm in Jamacia sippin daquiris, no doubt

We used to havin nothin, then grabbin somethin and bustin

Wanted to be the thug-nigga, that my old man wasn't

I came to a field, catchin cases, litigation

Niggaz playa-hatin, got me crooked in all 50 states

I'm screamin DEATH ROW, throw my WESTSIDE, ain't no thang

We was raised off drive-by's, brought up to bang

We claim mob, M.O.B. if you be specific

We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific

And get this, I'm hard to kill, when I peel with this live spot

Father, how the hell did I survive, these five shots?

Live it up, of give it up, and my demons

Late night, hear them screamin; we goin all out!



[Chorus: EDI]

We goin all out, bomb first till they fall out

Take them the war route, without a doubt

Ball, which means we all ride if it's on

Each nigga handle ya own, bring it on strong

If you got bills to pay, nigga go all out

Bustas playin with ya peeps, betta go all out

Try'na see the next day, nigga go all out

Obstacles in ya way, you better go all out



[Napoleon]

I'm on my land sled, walkin through the belly of the beats

Feelin like I'm all out, drunk as can be

It's plain to see, that we mobb niggaz hidin' in bushes

Claimin that they ride rough, but they soft as they cushion

They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin in blood

Outlawz my blood brothers, I'd die for these thuggs

Say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggaz on the west coast

was ridin with Pac, but when he died, they went pop

I'm on the Jers to the fullest, like some west coast love

But after Pac stopped rappin, it ain't no west coast thug

Just westcoast what? To my real niggaz stuck in the street game

Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin Kool-Aid through they veins

Is it true what I'm sayin? Slap your soft ass to the floor

And watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door

I ride or die, but these other fag niggaz be bitin this

It's all from my heart when I was writin this

All out



[chorus]



[Kastro]

Now, we all ride, and down to die who wit us

Speak up, or get treated like you comin to kill us

Ain't nothin but squealers, in this rap game, swearin they rough

Tattooed up, and now them niggaz swearin they Pac

Stop that, and watch ya back, we ain't forgot bout cha

These glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out cha

It's me, Kastro with the goattee

Walkin' like a OG, cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me

I pray to the thug lord, like that motherfuckers holy

Frontline soulja, till the heavens call me

I go all out, and if you real, you real

Feel what I'm talkin' bout, cause this game is ill

I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'till they feel it

Livin' proof, Pac breed niggaz, they can't deal wit'

Holla back, right back, and watch ya mouth

Or get blood in it, WHAT, we goin' all out 

Nigga

fool, you better go all out

keep goin' all out

all my niggaz goin' all out

Ey, you niggaz just gon think that you gon be uhh

[2pac]

Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin

Packed in a suburban, screamin outlaw runin on the curb

They never try me cause right behind me your killer team

I get a word cut the head off a nigga like a guillotine

This Hennessey'll keep me calm though

Sittin in the back of the club, tradin convo

Livin like a Don in my own mind

Signal Kadafi, nigga watch me with the chrome nine

All the time drinkin champagne

Walk through the crowd let the tramps hang

Niggas playa hate but do a damn thing

Picture me doin eighty down a one way

Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play

So I gotta keep my eyes open

Gettin high, wonder why we gotta die smokin

My alibi, I'm victory

Like them other vile men I'm marked for death

Spendin my nights like its the last one left

I'm an outlaw



[Chorus]

Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on

Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone

I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor

Puffin on a sweet swisher I'm the last one left

Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on

Last to leave until I see everybodys gone

I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor

Puffin on a sweet swisher, guess I'm the last one left



[Kastro]

I got my back against the wall

Gat chillin by my balls

Prior to war is rider nigga only five six tall

Napoleon only knows on we outlaws fuck fear

better strap down to the feelins cause we out yeah

Thug passion all up in me

Feelin like I took some Henne

It aint easy I'm tryin to make a dollar out of two pennies

What we got with these rap niggas

Wanna pull they're gat niggas

Only got my side cause they think pac die nigga

Last niggas with our tape

Take a shot within our vest

Pac come and catch weight

Nigga we the last ones left



[2Pac]

If we woulda known the zone inside my own dome

Fresh outs jail it was hell but I'm probably home

Lookin for niggas that was roofin that shit when I was locked back

Hands on the pump, makem jump when its cocked back

Fuckem all they're bitches inside a world of weak

Bitch niggas be afraid to speak

We the last ones left



[2Pac]

[Chorus (slight change)]

Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on

Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone

At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor

Puffin on a sweet swisher Like I'm the last one left

Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on

Last to leave till I see everybodys gone

At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor

Puffin on a sweet swisher, last one left

Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on

Last to leave till I see everybodys gone

At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor (Yeah)

Puffin on a sweet swisher, I'm the last one left



[Napoleon]

I eat and sleep the worst shit, turfs and birth

Me and my team super supreme putin in work

I'm passed out, drunk as a fuck, till it hurt

And I call earl screamin fuck the world

I got a bitch on the side wanna be my wife

And wify even wanna know if she gonna see me tonight

And i know it aint right, but its the life I got

And thats until I see Yak

And thats until I see Pac

Young know I lost a troll somebody owed me down

And if the world was a girl I'd stick my dick in the ground

Fuck the world

Verse One: 2Pac
Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me

I'm out the gutter, pick a hero

I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero

Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck

Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck

I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?

It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me

Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure

Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser

Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born

I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on

Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry

Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried

It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray

Hope I live to see another day, hey

I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?

Got my mama stressin thinkin it's a drug bust

Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached

We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last

Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask

That's the consequences when ya livin, fast

Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up

and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures

Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover

over the fence and open fire



""Alright now, here we go""



Verse Two: 2Pac



These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?

I'm comin round the corner like I'm Magic

Doin ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches

In a high speed chase with these punk bitches

Don't turn around I ain't givin up, cause they don't worry me

Pussy ass bitches better bury me

Runnin outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot

We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha

I got away cause I'm clever

Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together

I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin loogies

at the coppers that persue me, beotch!

I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker

Open fire on you bustas



""Alright now, here we go""



Verse Three: 2Pac



Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state

I gotta pay my fuckin bills, so I'm transportin weight

Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin

Droppin keys like they stolen, hehe

Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear

Enough dope to last a year

They got me running from the police, nowhere to go

With the lights out, rollin down a dirt road

But I ain't goin alive, I'd rather die than be a convict

I'd rather fire on my target

I hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit!

Them bitches right behind me

They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires

Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!



Hahahaha, Thug Life!"

This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellrazor... born thuggin
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's

Soakin up the game that was told to me

I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned

not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons

A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin

I was ganked for sexin

Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it

I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin class

and I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin

Mobbin through the overpass laughin

While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt

They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord

Can ya feel me? I keep my finger in the trigger

Cause some nigga tried to kill me

and mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin paid

Police on my pager, straight stressin

A fugitive my occupation is under question

Wanted for investigation, and even though

I'm marked for death, I'ma spark til I lose my breath

Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper

I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer

They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap

And they wonder why it's hard bein black

Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin major, unhh



Chorus: Stretch



Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major

Lord be my savior, unnh

(Repeat 4X)

Mama raised a hellrazor

[2Pac] Dear Lord can ya feel me

Stress gettin major, unnh

Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major



Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign

Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin

Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure

Why you let the police beat down niggaz

I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe

While the po' babies restin in the early graves

God come save the youth

Ain't nothin else to do but have faith in you

Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand

Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand

And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic

crooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord

Can ya feel me? Show a way

I'm prayin but my enemies won't go away

And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn

Every nigga that I know's on death row

My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price

Little young motherfucker doin triple life

Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better

If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof

Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama

Wanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts

Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin

Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin pen

Mama raised a hellrazor, uhh, yeah

C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellrazor

Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin major

(Lord be my savior, unnh)



Chorus: Stretch



Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major

Lord be my savior, unhh

(repeat 2X)

Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major



Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me

A young nigga tryin to make it on these rough streets

I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME

THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!

I got my three-five-seven can't control it

Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded

Everybody run for cover, I cause shit

Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick

Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me

Cause do or die gettin high til the bury me

Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why

Little girl like LaTasha, had to die

She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot

Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped

And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin 'Tasha

Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end

it's my friends, that flip-flop

Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop

Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots

Every nigga on my block dropped two cops

Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die

Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high

with my hands on the trugger, Thug nigga

Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer

And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life

I got the heart to fight now

Mama raised a hellraiser why cry

That's just life in the ghetto, do or die"

No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools

Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss 

Y'all don't wanna see me in pain

Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me? 

I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue 

and though I don't where we're goin, she's makin me come 

I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin? 

Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later 

Before I let her get me off guard 

Went in the purse took a hundred dollars 

Nigga I'm so scandalous 



Chorus 



[2Pac] 

Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin riches 

I'm spittin at tricks cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches 

Currency motivated, not easily terminated 

Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded 

This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid 

All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves 

I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin you could be true 

when I don't fuck with your punk crew 

These are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell 

I went from hell, to livin well 

Bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain 

I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game 

I wanna be a baller, please 

But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me 

I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans 

Can't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous 



Chorus 



Chorus *repeat to end* (2Pac speaks over it) 



[2Pac] 

Aiyyo.. how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be 

You ever peep that shit? (Nah) 

A bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin with a nigga 35 

Gettin him for ends 

Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent 

When these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then 

That's aight though 

Keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long 

Watch them hoes 

All you niggaz out there 

Beware these lyin ass scandalous bitches"

So come and get some of this thug passion Baby 



[Verse One: Dramacydal] 



I could pull out the drink 

and be good 'till it's relavent but 

I'm a straight solider, I'll roll up a nigga 

like its Heaven sent 

Tripping over dead presidents 

they got these derelicts 

I throw was down with this business 

Tryin' clown and get a cent 

and so rather 

than stand forever, been thinking 

drinking over a felony 

and hell of me and how it will be some other shit 

People telling me to cool out 

But they ain't feeling me 

a mutha fuckin fool 'bout 

my fuckin cheddar cheese 

and it pleases, passion of mine 

Thuggin huggin plenty of G's 

and laughing while I pass through times 

And all thes back stabbers be watchin 

Just keep it plain 

I'm a keep it the same partner 

Just take it the simple game 

I can pinkle with the rain twinkling 

diamonds and thangs go plinklin 

enough to hold me, til' I'm, old and wrinklin 

and These adversaries 

they gonna have to be worrying 

cuz I'm a be illing 

Fufillin my Passion 

Till I'm burryin' 

My Thug Passion 



[Chorus: Jewell] 



I heard it's the bomb 

and you got it going on 

give me some of your Thug Passion Babby 

You got me dripping wet 

from the way you make me sweat 

give me some of your Thug Passion Babby 

owwowwwowwww 



[Verse Two: Dramacydal] 



Now what if me 

turn this Henessee 

into a robbery 

the Prophecy probably suddenly 

switch and How it supposed to be? 

And Dirty money 

Can't be evil cuz it's filling up my tummy see 

Born in a position 

Death collision 

was futuristic 

twisting riches 

But there is only one way to make mo' 

so I'm standing on the corner 

trying to hustle in the snow 

and My bigga bro 

couldn't know 

but buy a four four 

blasting at playa hating 

wantin' mo' 

with a Thug Passion 



[Verse Three: 2Pac] 



Putting down mashin' 

control by this Thug's Passion 

unlike them other bustas pistol blastin' 

I'm asking, What Happened? 

To the niggas who kept it real 

like they claim to 

that's when I bang do 

see thang true 

Traveling this road my poor soul 

has been consolidated 

with all this bullshit I done tolerated 

How I made it 

can easily stated 

it's like my heart be gripped with the Passion 

to be the fucking greatest 

Load up and take shit 



[Dramacydal] 



Make this to some high dollar gangster shit 

jack a stack till we got enought bank to split 



[Verse Four: Storm] 



Creep with me 

through that Imortal flow 

Thug Passion got you tremblin' 

like Death on the Row 

make your move 

so I can throw your mind a curve 

while i'll be blowin up tha scene 

like my nigga Mr. Herb 

take a toke 

as your heart goes full arrest 

I got tha bomb 

so nigga, fuck tha rest 

ya need a 3rd to get ya flowin' 

and let that loc see smoke 

feelin' tha strokes of tha nine squeeze tight and slow 



[Chorus] 



[Verse Five: 2Pac] 



They say money don't make tha man 

but damn i'm makin' money 

observin' you muthafuckers 

cause some of you bitches funny 

say you want it 

but you bullshitin' 

lickin' them lips 

you got me about to act a fool quick 

sippin' on some Alazay and Cristal, meanwhile 

buy me a drink 

and get to winking at me 

she smiles 

a niggas full of passion 

Satisfaction is everlastin' 

How does it feel ? 

what i'm askin' 

while i'm rubbin' on that ass 

why you laughin' ? 

see, i'm diggin' as if i'm curious 

full blown and furious 

baby get a grip 

when I be doin' this 

It's so physical 

my attraction 

driven by alchol 

beware of my reaction 

baby i'm born to ball 

thugged out on Death Row 

You better recognize 

and picture what I said so 

Now you can feel it 

it's a potion for my niggas in motion 

forever blastin' 

bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

Good Evening [sirens in the background]
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard 
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles 
[crowd starts chanting ""Tupac""]

Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz 

This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac 

Which, raises the question 

Where are these songs coming from? 

It's interesting how, the message in these songs 

Is still relevant today 

Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics 

I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight 

When the album will officially be released 

Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

(sample repeats until first verse)
You know what time, boo-yaow

I know it's time for you

So grab one by the hand youknowhatI'msayin

And uhh, throw up that finger

Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!

Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?



Verse One:



Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya

I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya

If I'm wrong love tell me, cause I get caught up

and the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see

the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard

I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word

See you walkin and you lookin good, yes indeed

Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin me

witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony

cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me

I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame

but the industry's a lot like, a crap game

Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go

Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show

And even though I'm known for my one night stand

I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...



""Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy"" --> Erick Sermon (Redman's ""Watch Yo' Nugget"")

(sample repeats until second verse)



Throw up the finger!

And all my homies go..

Throw them the finger!

Ya know what baby it's like



*singing*

I know you've been searchin for someone

To make you happy, and get the job done

You say you need it, a man with money

But I can't be there, and will you still care



Verse Two:



Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows

Gettin weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go

in my ride and I'm all in, gettin high

I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by

Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God

Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard

All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do

Gettin shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool

Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide

If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie

Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words

in your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve

Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow

Can't hold it any longer, so let it go

Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven

Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...



""Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy"" --> Erick Sermon (Redman's ""Watch Yo' Nugget"")

Give em the finger!

All my homies go..

Throw your fingers up!

That's just the Thug in me girl, you know

Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like



*singing*

I know you've been searchin for someone

To make you happy, and get the job done

You say you need it, a man with money

But I can't be there, and will you still care



Verse Three:



A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down

Got a woman that'll please me, in every town

I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation

got me ready to release the fluid, sensation

sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand

Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand

Even the hardest of my homies need attention

Catch you blowin up the telephone, reminiscin

I wanna take you to the movies, and the park

Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark

Now that it's passion, hold me tight

Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight

I know your man ain't lovin you right

You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life

Enough talkin, you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin

See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was



""Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy"" --> Erick Sermon (Redman's ""Watch Yo' Nugget"")

(sample repeats until the end)



Give em the finger

And all my homies go.. yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?

Throw your fingers up

Y'know? They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you

and all other lil' young niggaz that's in a rush to be gangstas
As a young nigga, I'm almost ?swellin? in the wind
Give anythang, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin with the homies

tell them niggaz started slangin that they don't know me

I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me

Lately I've been tryin to make a bill-ion, can you play me

with that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me

If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I

someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride

Put down the top, now we flossin

Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window

Workin with a twenty sack of indo, feelin good

Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs

And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, know it's bad

but all we had was our hopes and dreams

Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends

as young niggaz



He's the kind of G like everybody knows

As a young nigga

He's always G'd up, from head to toe

My memories as a young nigga

Always got it blown like Al Capone

Young nigga

He's the downest G I've ever known



Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin by, when daddy died

That's when my momma started gettin high

My neighborhood was full of drivebys, couldn't survive

All our homies livin short lives, I couldn't cry

Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket

let me get my dead homies high

Come follow me throughout my history, it's just

_Me Against the World_ stuck in misery; as a young nigga

My only thing was to be paid

Life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady, back in the days

We always found the time to play,

but that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray

Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis

Every stadium that I go, when will they change?

Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga

Remember how it was, to be a young nigga



He's the kind of G like everybody knows

As a young nigga

He's always G'd up, from head to toe

My memories as a young nigga

Always got it blown like Al Capone

Young nigga

He's the downest G I've ever known



I'm tellin you..

.. to be young, have your brains and have every ? and all that

Yo, y'all niggaz don't know how good you really do got it

Muh'fuckers need to just calm down

and peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life

'Fore you end your life before you BEGIN your life

You dumb nigga



Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein somethin

Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin nuttin

Tryin to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real

and I will even if it kills me, my young niggaz

break away from these dumb niggaz

Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come nigga

Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin

puttin niggaz in a casket, murdered for hangin

at the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin

Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day

I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse

the epidemic and diseases, what is the future?

The projects lookin hopeless, where

more and more borhters givin up and don't care

Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed

and I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggaz



He's the kind of G like everybody knows

For these young niggaz

He's always G'd up, from head to toe

My memories as a young nigga

He always got it blown like Al Capone

Take it slow nigga, it's for the young niggaz

He's the downest G I've ever known

As a young nigga



He's the kind of G like everybody knows

He's always G'd up, from head to toe

Memories as a young nigga

He always got it blown like Al Capone

He's the downest G I've ever known

['Pac talking overlaps singing last four lines]

This go out to the young thugs, the have-nots (you know)

Little bad motherfuckers from the block (that's right)

Drivin Cadillacs, Benzes and shit (I see you boy)

Young motherfuckin hustlers (make that money boy)

Stay strong nigga

You could be a fuckin accountant, not a dope dealer

You could be a lawyer (really doe)

Damn, another funeral, another motherfucker
Lord knows * 'Pac is choking on blunt smoke *
Lord knows * coughing harder *
Lord knows * one final cough *

I smoke a blunt to take the pain out

And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out

I'm hopeless, they shoulda killed me as a baby

And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin crazy

Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket

and if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards

I'm loosin hope, they got me stressin, can the Lord forgive me

Got the spirit of a thug in me

Another sip of that drink, this Hennesey got me queasy

Don't wanna earl, young nigga take it easy

Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems

don't underestimate the power of a fiend

To my homies on the block

slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box

When you're runnin from the cops -- and never look back

If they could be black, then they would switch

Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...

I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G

I couldn't let my adversaries worry me

and every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest

and still a nigga stressin over death

If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd

take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly

When everyday it's another death, with every breath,

it's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!

You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?

Murderin niggaz, look what it's come to

My memories bring me misery, and life is hard 

in the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breath

Got me thinkin, what do Hell got?

Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin shell-shocked

And driveby's an everyday thang

I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game

Kill me if they could, I'll never let em capture me

Done lost too many niggaz to this gangbangin

Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin, fucked up!

I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie

and he knew it when he shook and died, my God

Even though I know I'm wrong man

Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)

I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches

Try to calm me down, I ain't givin up

I'm gettin lost in the weed, man, gettin high

Livin everday, like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)

I smoke a blunt to take the pain out, and if I wasn't high

probably try to blow my brains out

Lord knows...

Verse One: 2Pac
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets

Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face

Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place

Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool

with the big boys, breakin all the rules

I shed tears with my baby sister

Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids

And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama

When things went wrong we'd blame mama

I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell

Huggin on my mama from a jail cell

And who'd think in elementary?

Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day

And runnin from the police, that's right

Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside

And even as a crack fiend, mama

You always was a black queen, mama

I finally understand

for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man

You always was committed

A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it

There's no way I can pay you back

But the plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated



Chorus: Reggie Green & ""Sweet Franklin"" w/ 2Pac *



Lady... 

Don't cha know we love ya? Sweet lady

Dear mama

Place no one above ya, sweet lady

You are appreciated

Don't cha know we love ya?



* second and third chorus, ""And dear mama"" instead of ""Dear mama""



Verse Two: 2Pac



Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair

No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there

He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger

wouldn't let me feel for a stranger

They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along

I was lookin for a father he was gone

I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs

They showed a young brother love

I moved out and started really hangin

I needed money of my own so I started slangin

I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks

It feels good puttin money in your mailbox

I love payin rent when the rent's due

I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you

Cause when I was low you was there for me

And never left me alone because you cared for me

And I could see you comin home after work late

You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate

Ya just workin with the scraps you was given

And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin

But now the road got rough, you're alone

You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own

And there's no way I can pay you back

But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated



Chorus



Verse Three: 2Pac



Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama

I can always depend on my mama

And when it seems that I'm hopeless

You say the words that can get me back in focus

When I was sick as a little kid

To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did

And all my childhood memories

Are full of all the sweet things you did for me

And even though I act craaazy

I gotta thank the Lord that you made me

There are no words that can express how I feel

You never kept a secret, always stayed real

And I appreciate, how you raised me

And all the extra love that you gave me

I wish I could take the pain away

If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day

Everything will be alright if ya hold on

It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on

And there's no way I can pay you back

But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated



Chorus

LL raisin hell but, that didn't last

Eric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me

I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D

and Red Alert was puttin in work, with Chuck Chill

Had my homies on the hill gettin ill, when shit was real

Went out to steal, remember Raw, with Daddy Kane

when De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game

I can't explain how it was, Whodini

had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed, cause there I was

Them block parties in the projects, and on my block

You diggi don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock

Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte

Listen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night

With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic

Heheh... I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's

A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets

I'm playin skelly, ring to leavey, or catch a kiss

before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch, I remember

way back, the weak weed they had

Too many seeds in the trey bag

I'm on the train headin uptown, freestylin

with some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin

cause the hoochies was starin, thinkin, ""Why them niggaz swearin?""

I'm wonderin if that's her hair, I remember

Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall

or takin leaks on the steps, stinkin up the hall

Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile

A young nigga tryin to stay away from Riker's Isle

Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true

Out on the roof sippin 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school

And Scott LaRock the Super Hoe back in Latin Quarters

When Slick Rick was spittin La-Di-Da-Di

Gamin the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties, I remem-ber

breakdancin to Melle Mel

Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells

Forget the TV, about to hit the streets and do graffiti

Be careful don't let the transit cops see me

It ain't nuttin like the old school!

Remember seein Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin party?

Member how fuckers used to go, ""Is Brooklyn in the house?""

and motherfuckers would lose they GOD DAMN MIND

That's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin (Su-per, Sperm)

I remember goin places that motherfuckers was scared to say

Back in the motherfuckin old school nigga

Remember skelly nigga? Knockin niggaz out the box, poppin boxes?

[Tupac]

Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state

preoccupied with homicide, tryin to survive through this crime rate

Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards

Gunfire now they require may be closed casket

Who can you blame? It's insane what we dare do

Witness an evil that these men do, bitches in, too

In fact they be the reasons niggaz get to bleedin

Pull the fuckin fire when I leave em, you shoulda seen em

Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of

and snitches get dealt with, with no love

Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury

I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry

But never worry, they'll remember me through history

Causin motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a

Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin well

when I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell

Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin pictures of these bastards

Excersisin, visualizin, everyone inside a casket

Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggaz in masks

Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass

Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?

Shit's hard, who can you tell? Aand if we fail?

High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway

When will they learn to take it easy? Uh

Drivebys and niggaz die, murder without a motive 

by making motherfuckers fry

Got me runnin from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops

Helicopters tryin to hover over niggaz til we drop

Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire

Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a lie

Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch

""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence

I comense to get wicked, spittin rounds as the plot thickens

Never missin an early grave is my only mission

If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five

May God forgive me, I was high, label me a

[Dramacydal]

Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be

My mob'll be doin robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's

I witnessed niggaz lose they chest

For ordinary reasons niggaz bodies put to rest

So I just.. swallow my Beck's and holla, ""Fuck em!""

And if I'm next.. just let a nigga step with somethin

I ain't fearin nuttin



Young and thuggin, prepared for bustin if that's my destiny

Ready for whatever, see you niggaz can't get the best of me

(hold me down) Definitely no need for askin

(now he mad) Top speed (smokin weed) blasted (biotch!)



Cause when I bust em they gonna shiver, the killers cry

Soldiers got bodies floatin in the river, what is they sayin?

Talkin bout prayin -- they need to stop, that ain't gon' help

These niggaz sprayin up my block, tryin to take my wealth

Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge

Punk police, niggaz run the streets

Hahah, it ain't nuttin but muuuuzik

Shit's changed

1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin REAL strange

The rules is all rearranged

You got babies lyin dead in the streets

These punk police is crooked as me

but all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's

Stop bein a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga

Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger

Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel

Verse One: Live Squad

Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man

Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man

Cops step off, you know the flavor

They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior

And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet

Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin streets

It's like a madness, fuck making gravy

I rhyme and do crimes, cuz either way pays me

A little rough with a hardcore... theme

Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams

Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip

With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse

Representing YG'z yo

Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino

Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags

Stickin up spots and jumpin in Jags

Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin

And always keep a hand on the gat

Cuz a niggaz straight strugglin



Verse Two: Live Squad



I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin

I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin

I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker

But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it

Look as I cut the records hard to eject

A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit

I got energy to blast now you want the task here

Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up

But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin

Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in

Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it goin on

If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick

So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get

A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin

Get drunk but I don't think

I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch

When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch

Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch

You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame

Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game

I'm strugglin



Verse Three: 2Pac



Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang

Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang

Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back

Till I call back, niggaz runnin free better fall back

I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep

with a Mossberg wrapped in my seats

three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz

Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come

Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal

Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo

Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind

Clickin on the nine, out to get mine

I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom

Blowin motherfuckers to the moon

Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin

See me on the block, strugglin

And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed

I get in niggaz ass, blast

Straight strugglin"

Heh, so??
You say that like that means somethin to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time

for you to be comin home talkin that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)

We been gettin along fine just without you

Me, my brother, and my mother

So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. fuck you!



[2Pac]

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight

A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night

Please send me a pops before puberty

the things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity

Moms always work, I barely see her

I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her

It's a wonder they don't understand kids today

so when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way

And I hope that he answers me

I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family

A different father every weekend

Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends

I'm gettin sick of all the friendships

As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick

How can I be a man if there's no role model?

Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle

I'm so sorry...



(Chorus)

I'm so sorry

for all this time (I'm so sorry)

for all this time

for all this time (don't lie)

I'm so sorry

for all this time (so, sorry)

for all this time

for all this time, so sorry baby!



[Wycked]

Moms had to entertain many men

Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again

I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother

Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father

Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer

Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer

Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff

Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough

Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities

Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly

That's why I'll never be a father;

unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother

(That's when I started hatin the phony smiles

Said I was an only child)

Look at mama's lonely smile

It's hard for a son to see his mother cry

She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys

I'm so sorry...



(Chorus)

I'm so sorry

for all this time

for all this time

for all this time

I'm so sorry

for all this time

for all this time (so sorry)

for all this time, so sorry baby!



[2Pac]

Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes

Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show

And ohh -I guess ya didn't know 

that I would grow to be so strong

Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong

Where was the money that you said, you would send me

talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly

Ask about school and my welfare

but it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares

You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack

You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back

Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start

Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart

So don't even start with that ""wanna be your father"" shit

Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it

I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G

Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me

You're so sorry..



(Chorus)

I'm so sorry (so sorry)

for all this time (so, so sorry)

for all this time (I'm so so sorry)

for all this time (fuck that!)

I'm so sorry

for all this time (no)

for all this time (so sorry)

for all this time, so sorry baby!



[Tupac - impersonating his father]

I never meant to leave but I was wanted

Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted

Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger

If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a

Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number

Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to

Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast

But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass

Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along

I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong

It took a little longer than I thought

I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts

Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand

all I ever wanted was for you to be a man

and grow to be the type you was meant to be

Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me

I'm so sorry...

Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do
to me

Cause they never talk peace in tha black community

All we know is violence, do tha job in silence

Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants

Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn

Niggas commin' out worse offthan when they went in

Over tha years I done alot of growin' up

Getten drunk thrown' up

Cuffed up

Then I said I had enough

There must be another route, way out

To money and fame, I changed my name

And played a different game

Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle

If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho

And when I gettem

I'll hittem with tha bum rush

Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed

Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'

But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi

They got me trapped....

[Naw, they can't keep tha black man down]



They got me trapped

Can barely walk tha city streets

Without a cop harrassing me, searching me

Then asking my identity

Hands up, throw me up against tha wall

Didn't do a thing at all

I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall

Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete

Coppers try to kill me

But they didn't know this was tha wrong street

Bang bang, down another casualty

But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality

Who do you blame?

It's a shame because tha mans slain

He got caught in tha chains of his own game

How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me

Sweated me, hunted me

Trapped in my own community

One day i'm gonna bust

Blow up on this society

Why did ya lie to me ?

I couldn't find a trace of equality

Work me like a slave while they laid back

Homie don't play that

It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback

I'm tryin to avoid physical contact

I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack

They got me trapped

[Naw, they can't keep tha black man down]

Trapped

[uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down]

You know they got me trapped

[Naw, they can't keep tha black man down]



Now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway

All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay

Can't use tha phone 

Cause i'm sure someone is tappin in

Did it before

Ain't scared to use my gat again

I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant

But now he's tha devils friend

Too late to be tellin' him

He shot first and i'll be damned if I run away

Homie is done away I should of put my gun away

I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule

Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin ""Damn homies is dissin you""

I fired my weapon

Started steppin' in tha hurricane

I got shot so I dropped

Feelin' a burst of pain

Got to my feet

Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood

Now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer

Ran through an alley

Still lookin' for my getaway

Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today

Trapped in a corner

Dark and I couldn't see tha light

Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life

What do I do ?

Live my life in a prison cell

I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell

They got me trapped



Chorus



[Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down]

They got me trapped

Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats

Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID

I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin to rob me?""

He had tha nerve to, say that I had a curfew

(Do you know what time it is?

Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you!)

""Get out the car... or I'lI hurt you""

So here I go, I better make my mind up

Pick my nine up, or hit the line-up

I chose B, stepped into the streets

The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat

They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete

(Ay man.. aiyyo.. ay man just c'mon ?)

(""What you doin man?"") They tried to frame me

They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat

But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend

My homie panicked (""I'm out"") he tried to run 

(Freeze nigga!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun

My homie dropped so, I hit the cop

I kept swingin, yo, I couldn't stop

Before I knew it, I was beatin the cop senseless

The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless

(? Arrrrggggh, fuck you! Ungggh!)

Now I'm against this cop who was racist

Given him a taste, of tradin places

And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin this

frame up, but I came up

Now they claimin that I'm violent



Chorus



[2Pac]

As I was beatin on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-ohh)

Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit

I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand

He shot the cop (damn!) now he's a dead man

I said, come on, it's time for us to get away

(Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here)

They called for backup, and they'll be on their way

Jumped in the car, and tried to get away quick

The car wouldn't start (damn!) we in deep shit

So we jumped out (C'mon let's take the cop's car)

We drove a little ways thinkin that we got far

But I looked up, and all I saw was blue lights

If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight

I grabed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge

Load em up quick, it's time for us to spray

We'll shoot em up with they own fuckin weapons

And when we through sprayin (audi) then we steppin

This is a lesson, to the rednecks and crooked cops

You fuck with real niggaz, get ya fuckin ass dropped

So here we go, the police against us

Dark as dusk, waitin for the guns to bust (What's next man?)

What's next, I don't know and I don't care

One things fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here

But if I go, I'm takin all these punks with me

Pass me a clip G, now come and get me

You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent

Givin them a reason, (a reason) to claim that I'm violent...

More than an adversary I'm very quick

I'm ready to hit 'em with this gift

I'm equipped to kick

Grab you coat and you hat, cause I'm prepared to clamp

Scared the [???], and caught them mutha-fuckas damp

Oh shit, 2pacalypse is back and strapped

Attacking the pacs, I'm kicking the facts for stacks to rap 

And those that max, relax and let the blacks get jacks

I'm getting taxed, my pacs is packed with angry blacks

I'm ready to go

I'm ripping the shows, hitting the dough

Getting the hoes [???]

Pumping the flow, gangster ho 

cause the nose knows

Check the pose, froze, when you see me close

Punks you gonna roast, host, in a cloud of smoke

Broke, choked on a rope, and then smoked

wrote, crimes that'll bring me bank notes

nope, I ain't the type of fella that you use though

Kkkkkkicking the funky flava

Pumping [??? ???? ????] producers

Run for cover when you hear the bass drop 

One verse is all it takes

Ohh shit! Jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie?
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Oooh-wee! This is the life

New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife

It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick

Don't try to flip with the lip cause I run shit

Hip hip, hooray for the AK

Spray when I lay competition, what a great day

Make pay, next is the wet sex

Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex

I'm set, wonder what I tote, check

Bloody as a coat-check, snappin motherfuckers necks

Revenge so sweet when it comes from

niggaz get done with the drum, watch my foes run

Nigga keeps comin when they can't slip

Full of that shit, another hit from Tha' Lunatic



[Stretch]

Yeah, fuck that God! Word up

Blowin niggaz out the motherfuckin frame yaknahmsayin?

Constantly.. fuck that trick, we ain't havin it



[Tupac]

Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this

It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las

Cause I'm nothin nice and, I'm icin like Tyson

I'm grippin the mic and, my DJ is slicin

I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin to me with the SAME OLD

Tryin to do me like Nintendo

How the fuck you think I ever got this far?

By bootin motherfuckers like a shootin star

Cause I'm out to show, that I'm a dope MC

Think crack had you fiendin, wait'll they get a load of me

Bitches on my dick, like a motherfuckin 'conda

Niggaz wanna flip, let em step, and I'll bomb em

See somethin you want, why don't you come and get it

And then get waxed and taxed, like the government

Then I leave you sittin there, wonder where your money went

While your bitch is callin me, tellin me to come again

Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo

But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window

That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out

Lookin like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin posse, broke out

Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on

He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga

Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this

Feel the wrath.. and revenge of Tha' Lunatic



[Stretch]

Yeah Tu', tell them motherfuckers, word up

We ain't havin it, NONE of that shit!!

Bitch ass niggaz, niggaz can't fuck with us Tu', word up

Ninety-one, we takin this WHOLE motherfucker over

Niggaz got PROBLEMS in ninety-one

Ninety-two, and ninety-three

and all that other shit, word up!



[Tupac]

Recognize game when it smacks your bitch I'm back to rip

Puttin this on the map with this mackin shit

Time will tell if it's made well

Well I raise hell and excel cause it pays well

Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther

I'm funky, that's word to the father

Act like you know 'fore I thump, the bolo

Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin for my solo

Oh no, not another new jack, swearin that he's ruthless

Ducked, and now he's fucked and left toothless

I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared

You're scared and you're bound to go

It's somethin, I guess I let the beat keep bumpin

Stop trippin off these niggaz cause they ain't about nuttin

Or should I say NAYthin

Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in

I'm sick of the bullshit

Come equipped and get ready to rip

or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic



[Stretch]

Ahhhh yeah! FUCK THAT! (the motherfuckin lunatic)

YouknowhatI'msayin? Yes Tu'!

Tell them niggaz what time it is knahmsayin?

(punk motherfuckers, get the dick of the lunatic)

Niggaz can't fuck with us, word up

Bitch ass niggaz, FUCK EM!



[Tupac]

Fuck all them niggaz

I'm tellin these niggaz that they ain't got..

NAYthin on a nigga like me

We squashin these punk motherfuckers in ninety-one

ninety-two ninety-three.. and SO on

So let the beat FLOAT on

While I spray these PUNK BITCHES

Fuck y'all punk bitches!
