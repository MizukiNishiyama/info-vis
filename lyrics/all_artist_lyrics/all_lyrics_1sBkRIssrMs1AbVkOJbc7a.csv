Never show my hand, what they be sayin' 'bout us

Never show the 'Gram how we be playin' 'cause I don't care about it

Chopper to the bully, when we land, that chopper near by us

Nigga be tryna stand by us, just to get they level up

He hit the baddest bitch he had in his life, was standin' next to us

I can't even blame him, he get high-key on his camera up

'Cause I been really havin' it my way, this shit for regular

She fuckin' niggas that's regular, I had to cut her off

My money ain't even regular, couldn't even fuck her raw

If she know how I'm comin', she cum every time I fuck her hard

Fuck niggas, they'll try treat me like the underdog

Little homie serial, he on his seventh body

BM on some shit, still like that new seven body

I'ma ball 'til I fall, bitch could never guard me

Comin' short, that ain't no joke and you can't Kevin Hart me

Niggas think they ridin' dirty, but they movin' very sloppy

Got me out here on the North, this shitty very oppy

Got me way up in the hills, signal very choppy

Pussy very wappy, got a nigga jewelry shopping

Scoop her in a Sunday, in a cream whip, then she cherry top me

Then got right back to it, bitch could never stop me

I should not be taken lightly, I'm a heavy topic

And broke hoes always trippin', but it's never tropic

The Spanish mamis say, ""I like you talkin' heavy, papi""

New Pharrell Louis V with the leather floppies

Pull up to the valet with the engine revin', papi

Tellin' 'em, ""Be easy, this a foreign, not a Chevy, papi""

While you haters countin' us out, we countin' i tup

One billion, two billion, three billion, four

Cops yellin' ""Freeze"", I held my wrist up

All this ice, he probably freeze tryna frisk us

I'm with this bitch from, Belize, look like a princess

Doin' two-hundred in the Lamb', gettin dick sucks

You talkin' to the Rolex rockin', G5 flyin'

Say he on, it's no cap, he ain't lyin'

I don't think they made no jets that we ain't flyin'

I don't think they made bad bitches that we ain't dive in

Sittin' on the paper, aggravatin' the haters

Ballin' like Kawhi, LeBron, Clippers and Lakers

Judge tried to send me to jail, did me a favor

Forty mill' strong, I'm on a year later, thank you



I'm so high, cheers to the sky

I come alive in the night

Them flashin' red and blue lights

They watchin', waitin' on a shootin' star

But ain't no stoppin' the untouchables

We above the law

We above the law

That's with pen and the paper, I won't quit 'til we made it

If we beefin', we bangin', I won't sleep 'til we slay 'em

Will Smith with the smack, Chris Rock with the crack

Then forgot of his dream, Guy Fisher was back

All you wannabe thugs, rockin' corpse in the club

Niggas wanted the city, I just wanted the love

North Faces and foams, we grew up in that jawn

We was ballin' in Gordons before got Jones

Wake up early and go, still be late to the parties

Blame the watches I own, I'm showin' up ASAP, Rocky

Stop me, Murakami my carpets

It's scary at the top, but at the top, we fear the bottom

What that say about y'all? That can make it off bars

I played your tape the other day, I'm afraid it's a ""Nah""

It's a label to y'all, it's engravin' our scars

A decade with my guys, tribulations and trials

My ambition is gifted, it's nothin' baby, I shine

Wow, that's crazy, all this labor paid for acres and farms

Hah, well, this thing of ours

Our DNA is everywhere, we like three Genghis Khans

It's the three-headed monster, mashallah that we still on

And to think some lack the patience, now so who be long



Yeah

Uh

Crazy how shit go

Farewell



I may stumble and trip, I won't fumble a brick

If you come with a diss, I'ma come with the shit

Neither lackin, I'm loaded, had this bitch in the city

That's the pussy I purchase, swear you niggas gon' feel it

Competition I crumble, niggas murder for mumbles

Know they tappin' my talk, sellin' kilos all summer

Got the prices to drop, livin' nice as The Rock

Hookahs all through the mansion, it's so nice at the top

Million dollars in watches, niggas envy my boast

Yes, it gotta be mine, all that sippin', I toast

Only dollars I sign, no economy flows

Heard you work with the feds, 'nother Barnaby Jones

Not a part of my bones, I just got a new bonus

So I got a new home, go to war like the Romans

This is not a new song, but the ways of a poet

Now it's time to go home, not the same for opponents

I'ma make it clear as I can for you young niggas

You hear me? (Oh yeah, yeah)

Biggest (M-M-Maybach Music)



Problem was I never was a prodigy

Possibly, my biggest flaw is lack of modesty

Diabolical means, never knew college degrees

Sippin' coffee at a cafe on college, capisce?

Niggas soul being sold and still own a leash

Roger Goodell boy, he ain't a corniche

I was really throwin' money, I really saw Meech

And I let them rappin' niggas get closer to Meek

It ain't bottle made the most but let's make a toast

'Cause a lot of niggas told and kept it on the low (Oh yeah)

How a self-made nigga never wanna vote? (Oh yeah)

And before a record label, shit, I wanted coke

I'm talkin' L.A. Reid, the biggest babyface

This for my niggas in the prisons sippin' Gatorade

All these hitters takin' pictures for they babies maid

Her baby mama's in the projects tryna make a way (Oh)

Niggas lookin' funny when you get the hunnids (Oh yeah)

I gotta school Adonis, daddy get 'em punished (Oh yeah)

Because I'm on the streets, they consider me cunning (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

Hit your bitches in a Tesla at the push of a button (Oh)

If she got up in the coupe then she gotta be fuckin'

Fifty restaurants but a lot of me hungry (M—M—M)

These niggas wanna gossip, I just want the dollars

All black Phantoms going south from Collins (Oh yeah)

Villains know we killin' so that ain't a problem (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

I'm gonna stack my money, be a better father

You could pat me down but I got it regardless

Shades that I'm rockin', they gotta be goggles (Oh)

When we plot to kill 'em, we send a few bottles (Oh)

Set 'em up like 2Pac, get 'em to rob 'em (Oh)

I always loved BIG, shit, I did it big

I released Omarion, he began to fizz

Double M the kids, now we back to biz'

Thirty-six a brick, baby, here it is

My niggas in designer but we militant (Oh yeah)

I got the city on my back and that's just what it is



Two twenty on the dash, still can't stop us

I just got back to my girl to the opera

'Cause Ojek got back, he went and bought a chopper

As if it couldn't get worse, we lost Kobe in a 'copter

Three months later, niggas forget all about you

Always doubt you, now they can't live without you

Did you cry for the man or did you cry for the fame?

Did you pour out for the pain?



I've been around this world so many times I

Just love and loyalty by any means

I've been around this world so many times I

I know to never pray amongst your enemies

I've been around the world too many times now

That new shit just feelin' old to me

And trustin' new niggas been old to me for so long

When the real niggas coming home? (M—M—)

Home (It's been a mean world without you)

Yeah, shouldn't I, baby, shouldn't I?

When the real niggas coming home?

Home (It's been a mean world without you)

Yeah, shouldn't I, baby, shouldn't I?

They watchin’ me close, even readin' my lips

Bussin' the .45, then I'm pleadin' the fifth

And I'm leavin' as if that's a meeting I missed

Such a wonderful time, even blew ’em a kiss



Timbaland rich, two-fifty a beat

You should see his new crib, even came with a street

Still be touchin’ the white, talkin' that Bubba Sparxxx

It got a double R on it if it’s one of ours

Run along, boy, if you don't want a war

I got a prize, motherfucker, it's the Pulitzer

Woop, woop

It's [Ferro Dinero ?][1:20]



They say that the floor is facetious

Fat boy just keep fillin’ the bleachers

Went from sellin' yayo with the nosebleeds

Young niggas only got rich with the wrong things

I'm thankful for melodies that the song bring

Rhymin' longer than prison sentences in New Orleans

My nigga did a dub, now he at the fed

Shit, it's hard to feel the love when you takin' meds

Them Percocets, they heavy on the ledge

Twenty million cash, yes, that's called success

Thousand acres, my own metropolis

And he still hustle with dominance

Niggas fake and I can tell by the pics

Instagram should take down your page for all those counterfeits

Gettin' money, you're still [boobie gang ?][2:07]

Where the rats and the roaches would race

Now it's rap niggas' smoke-filled estates

Who envisioned my initials in the gates?

Confidential but these bitches know they place

Count C-notes, kilos like I'm cuttin' cakes

Even Janet Reno know a nigga race

Prince appeal, poppin', sippin' purple rain

Ask me how I feel, I tell you I no longer feel the pain

Kill the game, that's three hundred for the chain

And it don't include the charm just to show you who the king

Hundred cars just to show you we at odds

Let's begin to have you dress to your weed in cigars

Stay on the phone, but I limit all remarks

Just remember we the mob and regarded as a god

They want informants on the clique side (Clique side)

They wanna know how low the bricks fly (Bricks fly, uh-huh)

They wanna know a nigga dick size (Dick size, check one, two, one, two)

Yo, I came home with a connect and got started abruptly

That's five figures off a chick and I bought her Kentucky

We did that twice, then invested in artists that's hungry

To change a young nigga life and launder the money, wait

No handouts, I'm goin' on three summers legit

Machine, Cutter, and West, and me, each one of us rich

Before I did it, they ain't know these numbers exist

A nigga left the plug, then blew up three hundred to six, mmm

Yeah, Forgiatos veerin', smokin' while I'm steerin' (While I'm steerin')

I don't gotta pick these hoes, they volunteerin' (Volunteerin')

Jump out, diamonds glarin', flexin', why they starin'? (Why they starin'?)

I know you wanna take it, so that's why I wear it

I heard they wanna know how much the clique makin'

In this book of life, you can't skip pages

Got my strip quakin' off a wrist, takin' big paper

I'm really in the field, you just Skip Bayless, ah



It's incredible, huh

Been a baller but you never been a base

Just a casket for kilo in a crate

Pray for pastors trapped outside of the gates

Young bastards never tappin' the brakes

Dumb rappers never ownin' the tapes

Just tools and afterparties to make

More beefs and dirty bitches to chase

New shoes, expensive cars to race

Big homes, just pay 'em off at a pace

I threw in the elevators and sat 'em right on a lake

Been in moments the business was at a break

I'm at the fork in the road, which way, Hov or Ma$e?

New crib, now add up all of the bills

The niggas you wanna kill, another slice of the cake

More ice and wiretaps from Vice

Rep double M, they wanna lead a double life

Whack a nigga, need no receipts

Clap a nigga, leave him on the seat

It seem like I'm the one they really wanna be

Envy won't be tolerated, so let's cut this conversation

And true love what I got for mine, otherwise it's complicated

Fake shit, just a fantasy, things you may have contemplated

Judas was a politician, made up like a Ronald Reagan

This is just a war on drugs, tell me how you feel about it

Black lives really matter now, tell Emmett Till about it

George Floyd was face down as you niggas stood around it

Did your little FaceTimes, left the neighborhood astounded

Reason why I sold dope, I just want a way around it

BMs and my gold ropes, let you know I made allowance

Sacrifice your appetite, time to climb a major mountain

Marathon, it still continues, and I put my label on it

First I had to teach myself, then I started teachin' wealth

No longer am I seekin' shelter

No longer am I seekin' shelter

I'm coast to coast, I do this shit, I'm mad familiar

I'm papi in Brasília

I know these streets'll kill you

I tripled up my net worth, went and purchased me a pavilion

I'm plugged in with Siberia

It's cold, I keep my hoodie on (My hoodie on)

Glock 45, ready to get my boogie on

You pussy niggas panties showin'

My bitch say I talk in my sleep

I start park, drive and put it in reverse with my heat

Pistol talkin' back, I think I heard it cursin' at me (21)

It say ""You better not fuck a bitch or write a verse without me"" (On God, God)

The streets left me scarred (Me, scarred)

Nigga, I'm bleedin', but it's concrete showin' ('Crete showin')

Yes, uh (M-M-M)

They callin' it pandemic, when it's really life

The only way to separate the men and mice

Until you seem successful, you considered roguish

That's why you seen that nigga pull up in a Lotus

He got the 40 on him, up against his colon

Standin' in the club and know them niggas rollin'

We all got a purpose and my people servin'

All got some work in and I'm speakin' murders

Still be countin' funds until my fingers purple

Prayin' for your mother, but'll still hurt ya

Smokin' on a bag that I got from Berner

The bottles all black and that bitch a earner

Soldiers wavin' flags when they see the colonel

If you see the flash, then it don't concern you (On God)

Huh



You messed around but I forgave ya

Why do they still want me to hate you?

Lookin' deep into my eyes, you wanna see me rise

Who was born commitin' sins? You better watch the signs

King of all kings, black Rothschilds

One nigga from the South a get you crossed out

So fuck where you from and fuck what you sold

Watch how you come or watch how it go

I diss who you fear 'cause I knew they'd fold

And now I'm richer than them niggas, I could do the most

Money through the roof, it's falling from the sky

Counting money on a Pеrcocet high

I watch how you speak, I listen to your tonе

The watches that you wear, this different time zones

Crispy calamari, tears for the foes

Murder undercover strip from your clothes

Coupes for the curbs, suicide doors

Suits to be served for the drug lords

Clubs full of haters, tips for the waiters

Body count, AK-47's made us

Bal Harbour shops, ninety in a knot

In Design District, boy, you see me at the top

Coast clear, let's reward the ones who cook raw

Dolce & Gabbana buttoned to the neck

Still hoping that Your Honor let the jury rest

It's buttoned to the neck

Praying that Your Honor let the jury rest

All I wanna do is watch the ship float

As the sunset, I'm talking big dope

Money through the roof, it's falling through the sky

Spent two hundred for the coupe, they wanna shoot inside

Fuck wearing vests, I knew they wouldn't fit

I'm too slow to run, that'd get me flipped

They want me broke but a nigga rich

I'm talking real money, and not just nigga rich

Rap beefs'll get you niggas buried back east

At least, bitch niggas better act easy

I bought the restaurant, she sold your metaphors

I held my niggas down, you hit the panic doors

I'm not impressed by the paintings on these niggas walls

But will he really draw when in amidst the war?

I do it for my homies up against the ropes

Twenty years in this, talking to a ghost

Money through the roof, it's falling through the sky

My homie in the pen' until the day he die

I put it on his books and give it to his wife

He told me not to visit and to live my life

Money through the roof, it's falling through the sky

All these broke niggas gotta run inside

Goyard luggage, I just wanna fly

I pray my niggas get to see that other side

Hundred bricks a boy out in St. Croix

For the big belly ass rude boy

Problem was I never was a prodigy

Possibly, my biggest flaw is lack of modesty

Diabolical means, never knew college degrees

Sippin' coffee at a cafe on college, capisce?

Niggas soul being sold and still own a leash

Roger Goodell boy, he ain't a corniche

I was really throwin' money, I really saw Meech

And I let them rappin' niggas get closer to Meek

It ain't bottle made the most but let's make a toast

'Cause a lot of niggas told and kept it on the low (Oh yeah)

How a self-made nigga never wanna vote? (Oh yeah)

And before a record label, shit, I wanted coke

I'm talkin' L.A. Reid, the biggest babyface

This for my niggas in the prisons sippin' Gatorade

All these hitters takin' pictures for they babies maid

Her baby mama's in the projects tryna make a way (Oh)

I gotta school Adonis, daddy get 'em punished (Oh yeah)

Because I'm on the streets, they consider me cunning (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

Hit your bitches in a Tesla at the push of a button (Oh)

If she got up in the coupe then she gotta be fuckin'

Fifty restaurants but a lot of me hungry (M—M—M)

These niggas wanna gossip, I just want the dollars

All black Phantoms going south from Collins (Oh yeah)

Villains know we killin' so that ain't a problem (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

I'm gonna stack my money, be a better father

You could pat me down but I got it regardless

Shades that I'm rockin', they gotta be goggles (Oh)

When we plot to kill 'em, we send a few bottles (Oh)

Set 'em up like 2Pac, get 'em to rob 'em (Oh)

I always loved BIG, shit, I did it big

I released Omarion, he began to fizz

Double M the kids, now we back to biz'

Thirty-six a brick, baby, here it is

My niggas in designer but we militant (Oh yeah)

I got the city on my back and that's just what it is



Two twenty on the dash, still can't stop us

I just got back to my girl to the opera

'Cause Ojek got back, he went and bought a chopper

As if it couldn't get worse, we lost Kobe in a 'copter

Three months later, niggas forget all about you

Always doubt you, now they can't live without you

Did you cry for the man or did you cry for the fame?

Did you pour out for the pain?



I've been around this world so many times I

Just love and loyalty by any means

I've been around this world so many times I

I know to never pray amongst your enemies

I've been around the world too many times now

That new shit just feelin' old to me

And trustin' new niggas been old to me for so long

More ice and wiretaps from Vice

Give her a dub for a purse, that ain't into a nigga

Give 'em a dub, get you murked, niggas murdering niggas

Ice vanilla chinchilla, niggas roll with the killers

Send load to the floor and then lay 'em like a caterpillar

I'm coast to coast, I do this shit, I'm mad familiar

I'm papi in Brasília

I know these streets'll kill you

I tripled up my net worth, went and purchased me a pavilion

I'm plugged in with Siberia

She compliment the swag, make a nigga feel imperial

Do the dash-dash, I get ghost with a baddie

Emilio Pucci gon' have a bitch splashy

Let her ride foreign just so she won't be tacky

Silent like a killer with that drr, let it ring

Since you wanted stars, gotta fuck me like a king

Different lifestyle, different clarity for a queen

I'm not impressed by the paintings on these niggas walls

But will he really draw when in amidst the war?

I do it for my homies up against the ropes

Twenty years in this, talking to a ghost

Money through the roof, it's falling through the sky

My homie in the pen' until the day he die

I put it on his books and give it to his wife

He told me not to visit and to live my life

Money through the roof, it's falling through the sky

All these broke niggas gotta run inside

Dry land when you wanna be out on the lake (Swish)

Determined to be one of the fortunate men

Bitches come from everywhere, once the hustlin' commence

I see you prayin', testifyin', forgotten the time

Bottom line, your cars should get shot up like it were mine

My voodoo, they all know the spirits when I be aroused

Made it to Star Island, started with a nickel rock

Who thought a project nigga get to get a yacht?

Two million dollars cash in the Range Rover

Whip it in the kitchen, that boy was a fast learner

Time to live it up, two million tucked in that new Bentley truck

Ain't too many I can trust so shooters is a must

I reminisce when it was hit or miss

I was innocent until I hit a lick

Seven figures on a nigga mama couch

Don't want to hear nobody talkin' 'bout a drought (Boss)

I'm chilling in a yacht in my Mitchell & Ness

Stitches in my britches, 57S

Second weekend, I just had to go buy me a drop

Slick remarks and I'm in county, yeah look at him shop

Cold games, I gotta step out, I'm on 'em in furs

Gil Green, the way I capture the moment with words

City mine, I keep the killers to fill up a church

Swear to God, a quarter kilo won't get you a verse

Bring mine, stay on time, and that's where we resign

Meanwhile, we'd be having such a meaningful time

Spiritual nigga, baptized up in G5

With bad bitches who idol still with Nicki Minaj

Rags to richest, now I move with beautiful women

Newfound, new beginning, one day that I grew to be winning

Broken memories
You will find a way
Rule number one is you can never rat

Fucking with you suckers set a nigga back

Break 'em down to baby sacks of Similac

And the only things on tracks I'm serving is the facts

Wanna pop the chain, kill you for your charm

Never mind your name, call you Uncle Tom

Shoot in front of bitches, never made a difference

'Cause impressing all the pigeons was the biggest interest

Quick to get it popping, nothing for your pockets

Crack melt like Baskin Robbins, never break a promise

Cops rushing doors, niggas flushing dope

Who really tipping Crime Stoppers? You would never know

Half my team illiterate, I know it sound pathetic

But we can each get a brick that's on a line of credit

Lot of niggas died over fake pieces

And the day I go, I pray my son, he get to read this



Broken memories always fade

Live on and you will find a way

Things will be okay, don't be afraid

Live on and you will find a way (Maybach Music)



Uh, I only remember nights that was post-traumatic

So I'm never actin' bougie like I was supposed to have it

Serving addicts, toting ladders, it was so dramatic

Putting friends before my family my worsest habit

'Cause in my hood, it ain't no friends when you get the Benz

'Cause homie in the backseat wanna split your wig

Just to play the driver seat and say he hit a lick

And he gon' post it on the 'Gram like, ""Don't forget the vid'""

Seen niggas tell on their own homies just to get to LIV

Miami on a Sunday just to commit them sins

And these the ones we supposed to ride for, forget the kids

Throw your life away for a nigga that wouldn't send your kids

Twenty dollars when you in your bid, this the way we live, the way we did

'Cause I'm in the chains, fuck the way it is

The way it was, now the only way is up

I'm never into faking love, I'm only here to wake you up

Young nigga



Broken memories always fade

Live on and you will find a way

Things will be okay, don't be afraid

Live on and you will find a way



In a 9-11, came without a ceiling

Can't imagine all the pain your brother was concealing

When we order fully loaded 'cause it's so appealing

Sue you and then do you for a couple million

Started from the bottom, rip the carpet up

Parents great examples 'cause they never argue much

Air conditioner in the window, watch the water drip

Premonitions of my death is what I wanna miss

Pretty pictures of my kids the only ones I kiss (Lord)

When you get a second chance, young brother, what a gift (Yes)

New obituaries everywhere I look

Praying every hour God keep me on His books (Jesus)

Cemeteries, we pull up on 'em in foreign cars (Jesus)

Extended payments elated, now met with open arms (Jesus)

Look at all these rappers wearing bogus charms (Lord)

When they barely pay for marijuana in cigars

I can't name a fake nigga that was not exposed

How y'all niggas so surprised that Tekashi told?

Ain't a real street nigga 'less you got a code

Mines one comma, nigga, followed by a lot of O's

In the back of the 'Bach, rock a lot of gold

Rap music on the charts like it's rock and roll

Add somethin' to the art, make a lot of dope

Gotta play my part from the start 'cause that's all I know

Double M's, double R's, nigga, all I roll

Court side, goin' viral when them punches thrown

On Crenshaw takin' pictures like we Rich and Po

'Nother rich rap nigga, word to Ricky Roz' (Maybach Music)

Yeah



Ooh

Got money, got women, got cash, I'ma spend it on you

Maybach all tinted, but you see how you're livin', ooh

It's a lifestyle, yeah (Lifestyle, yeah)

Hell of a lifestyle, yeah (Lifestyle, yeah)

Iced out, yeah

It's a rich nigga lifestyle



Heard they wanna put ya boy to rest just like I'm Malcolm X

Jealous of my point-of-view, watchin' the sunset

I just keep on movin' so you won't catch a contact

All my dirty niggas showin' me where the love at

Drop the top, candy painted, haters eliminated

Take a photo for fanatics, I often demonstrate it

Rich nigga, dirty game, I'm talkin' Nick Saban

Rich reignin' every day, whiter than Dick Cheney

Dirty nigga, but my sneakers new

She can go and get the two-door in a week or two

Dirty nigga with a couple things I could treat her to

Or maybe send her to the jeweler just like Meek'd do

Real niggas that was born to kill

Dirty niggas touchin' 40 mil'

40 cars on the sporty wheels

Gold bars in my shorty wheels



Ooh

Got money, got women, got cash, I'ma spend it on you

Maybach all tinted, but you see how you're livin', ooh

It's a lifestyle, yeah (Lifestyle, yeah)

Hell of a lifestyle, yeah (Lifestyle, yeah)

Iced out, yeah

It's a rich nigga lifestyle



Ain't nothin' changed but the commas

They say the more money, more problems

But you don't really want these problems

So watch what you say to me

Shorty, come easily

You ain't who you claim to be

I'm just tryna keep it real

Ain't no fucks around here

'Cause we're self-made

This forever is the lifestyle



Ooh

Got money, got women, got cash, I'ma spend it on you

Maybach all tinted, but you see how you're livin', ooh

It's a lifestyle, yeah (Lifestyle, yeah)

I'm so iced out, yeah (Iced out, yeah)

That's the only question I got for you
Huh
Flowers on my grave, doves in the sky (Doves in the sky)
Rats in the sewer dance when I die (When I die)

Champagne in the shower, toast when I cry (When I cry)

I was born to kill, livin' is a crime (Is a crime)

Nikes in the box until the money fill it (Money fill it)

Ski mask in my pocket so don't make me peel it (Make me peel it)

Yayo in my blood, it's like I need a rush (Need a rush)

Head all in your system, pussies need a flush (Need a flush)



Choppers on the seat as I listen to Meek

Speakin' less to niggas as bodies increase

See me on your set, better check your circumference

Might end up on your back and not bein' responsive

I was forced to kill 'cause I want to live

And if you wanna buy a crib, they give you thirty years (Thirty years)

Me against the world, pistol in your clutch (In your clutch)

They like to call it freedom, it was never such (It was never such)

Niggas on the porch, weed in the blunts (In the blunts)

You go against the team, you ain't seen in months (Seen in months)

Bitch nigga died, bitch niggas die (Niggas die)

Flowers on his grave, doves in the sky (Doves in the sky)

Pocket full of money and I need the most

I tell 'bout what you are, you niggas' needle's low (Needle's low)

Bitches know you broke just lookin' at your hoes (At your hoes)

They need some newer purses than they shit they post (Shit they post)



Kilo in the mornin', skip the cappuccino (Cappuccino)

Bomb under my car like I was Al Pacino (Al Pacino)

Flowers for a king, flowers for a king (For a king)

I ain't playin' wit' 'em, no way, no how (No how)

Got the .40 in my 'Didas sweats right now (Boom)

Had to count up all the paper, took me three nights

Pray the Lord protect my soul, I'm just tryna make it (Make it)

Had to leave them niggas 'lone, they was thinkin' basic (Yeah)

So many hundreds in my pocket like some Hammer pants (Hammer pants)

Shit be funny 'til you ridin' in that ambulance (Woo)

Powers of position I'm addicted to

That's what sweepin' up the block just for a nickel do

I put down nickel rocks just in the nick of time

Now that S500 Benz just circle fifty times

Hundred shots, don't make me put that .50 down *gunshot*

When that bitch go off, I bet it make a nigga proud

Walk up on you and he make a piggy sound

Then I'm back to the strip club to blow a bitch allowance

We know them niggas tellin' but we hustle harder (Hustle harder)

I was born to kill, I pray I die a martyr (Die a martyr)

You should die today but I'ma try tomorrow (Try tomorrow)

I always end a threat that's followed by the flowers

I just got a phone call, that boy Bo Diddley home

I bet in thirty days that boy be fifty strong

Race to get a million just the way we think

Middle of the summer in a cheetah mink (Cheetah mink)

What good is all the wealth, shittin' on yourself? (M'-M'-M')

I'll give you back the money just to get my health

All the rifles on the block be fully automatic (M'-M'-M')

Kids dying in the projects while we living lavish

Welfare cheese and the pigeon P's

I'ma skip the lobster tails, I want the chicken wings (M'-M'-M')

I pray it come a day when everybody eat

Your president on Twitter while my people on the street

Half these niggas snakes, others wanna leech

Never cared what you make 'cause it's in my reach

Every day I wake up and I pray for Black Bo

Damn, I miss my nigga, that's what really matter most



All the diamonds in the Rollie, yeah, we prayed for that

Big yard full of foreigns, yeah, we prayed for that

Move mama out the ghetto, yeah, we prayed for that

I got the joke but disagreed on the shit that he said

What happened to the perfect picture? (M'-M'-M')

If it's fuck the other side, then that's what it is

After every murder, celebrating off in LIV

How you jealous of a nigga's swag?

When every bird I got fronted, I broke it in half? (M'-M'-M')

Every Sunday on my phone, watching TD Jakes

Readin' scriptures to my soul helped me see the snakes

Drop the top on the foreign when the feds out

Acting like FCI ain't givin' bids out

Just to think about my youngin, it just give me chills

Niggas jeopardize they weed just to drop a grill

Glorifyin' snitch niggas who be cuttin' deals

Let 'em go against the code for a dollar bill (M'-M'-M')

Got pilots and gunners, receivers, passers and punters

More raw 'til Hov cut the 'fro off



Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)

It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space (And you can still)

Oh, you can find me in my Maybach

Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)

Oh, ah, Maybach Music



Let's go for a ride to where your heart desire

I put your heart in drive, I'll let you borrow mine

My feet on top the clouds, I walk a thousand miles

She got them soft pussy lips, call it cotton mouth

And I'm on autopilot, got a larger closet

I'm at target practice, you at Target shoppin'

Second hand smoke got her vision partly cloudy

Her eyes get so watery, them bitches started drownin'

On the ride of a lifetime

Watch out for the rats, mice, cons and the pythons

No Triple H, my God, I'm so sky high

Comin' down from the night sky, like a lightening rod

Shine like some ice, nice vibes, like a kite flyin'

No strings attached, we replace it with a lifeline

Out of body feelin', out our clothes and our right minds

Baby, ride me like a bumpy road to the high rise, yeah, yeah



Glidin' through the city to my place (My place)

It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space (And you can still)

Oh, you can find me in my Maybach

Listening to shit from way back (Maybach Music)

Oh, ah, Maybach Music

She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?

You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different

Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision

You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it

I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit

I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious

All smiles, Kevin Durant trials

Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'

I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles

I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?

My depositions never surface

Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased

Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses

Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase

Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on

Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán

Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star

Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards

Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours

Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart

Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod

Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God

Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed

The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless

Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it

'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed

Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world

""I gotta get the most of everything"" is the axis on which it sit and twirls

Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world



Ayy, woah

You made me this way, yeah

Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah

Put some flowers in my face, won't you?

Let me know that I did okay, yeah

Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no

They love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late

This different right here, yo



I was nominated, never won a Grammy

But I understand, they'll never understand me

Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked

Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny

A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned

Love makin' love, but where will love land me?

Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us

But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers

Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us

Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?

Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell

And what I got for sale just sit on the scale

Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades

I really seen things give mothers the shakes

I really bought cars for women on face

I know it seem odd, but money amazin'

College loans really did fuck up her credit

Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it

While we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal

In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil

Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level

Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever

Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)

Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers

Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma

Coming to America, really the set

I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet

All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers

Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?

Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple

Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches

Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish

Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)

Ayy, woah

Put some flowers in my face, won't you?

Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight

True love in the projects is called paradise

All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right

But honesty itself a small sacrifice

My money bag heavy, got me packin' light

You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?

Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false

He own condos right over Carnegie Hall

Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked

Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark

You really are my type, that's not a facade

One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis

I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip

After further thought, better not knock 'em

Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'

Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (Stop talkin', stop talkin')

That's all I ever wanted, just to being something man
At that point what else can you ask for?
Tears running out of a nigga face

In a room full of failures I feel out of place

Still sleeping on the floor when you deserve better

Got you reeking through the cold even in warm weather

I told Meek I wouldn't trust Nicki, instead of beefing with your dog you just give him some distance

We all make mistakes, lets not be to specific

You rather be a killer than be statistic

An never fold no I never ran

On my soul I'll roll like an avalanche

I thank the lord I got some great friends

That's why every bottle I open I say amen

Just had seizure at the Super Bowl

Woke up in the third quarter looking for the smoke

If its more then a quarter million, Ill count it twice

Poochie broke my heart shit I call it life

An never will I call it rite

Not perfect but I'm the one you would call at night

Traveling the world, I'm just reppin' my city

But rarely do I hear that this nigga done did it

When niggas in fatigues will keep you intrigued

Cause the loss of lifes the only thing that niggas believe

So I pray you listen carefully

Then I become another muthafuckin' casualty



Always speak and say right

I just never ever walk on by

(never ever walk on by)

You even stop and put one in the sky

(the sky)

You do it for the love of you and I

(for the love of you and..)



Standin' on your block but you so out of place

Uncle on the couch, momma running out of space

Lights off so you never tend to speak much

Go your separate ways every time the lease up

A fat ugly nigga thought I'd never be nothing

Another tree stump, happy with his free lunch

Duckin' pigeons, I'm an eagle on a sunny day

Flap my wings once a week, pray I glide safe

I want fried chicken at my funeral

Rolls Royces, dope boys, Sway interviews

Everybody dying for the same things

Cop kill a nigga don't nobody gangbang

I'm happy Donald Trump became the president

Because we gotta destroy, before we elevate

Real shit, look at me inside the white house

With a pocket full of weed inside the white house

Dead presidents tattooed on a nigga chest

U.S. treasury addressing me, mad at my address

Own the biggest residential pool is the US

Drake and Kanye can invite every bitch they ever met

Finger fuckin' bitches in the holy water

Then I go an tell what happened to my only daughter

So her daddy told it to her firsthand

Never perfect but its not just bout them purses



Always speak and say right

I just never ever walk on by

(never ever walk on by)

You even stop and put one in the sky

(the sky)

You do it for the love of you and I

(yeah)



The streets could never teach me

All the things I got from you

I found myself in the wrong lane

And I ended up in pain (Pain)

I was strolling down a dark street

When this girl passed me by

She said you've always been a good friend

(Always been a good friend)

And you never never never let me down

I'll just fall back never turn back

Let it go let it go

I'll just fall back never turn back

Let it go let it go



Always speak and say right

I just never ever walk on by

But you hate me buying real estate in foreign land

Respect my genius, all my people Portishead

Room full of cloaks and they count votes

Million man march and I'm taking notes

Black Metaphor



I grew up on that Cash Money

Bling bling, was well known to flash money

Hit the liquor store, after my Vic authority

Quick to switch a bitch up, pick up me a thicker shorty

Pistol on me, nigga, ain't no pickin' on me

We veterans so it's better if you go get your army

A thug holiday is where your body lay

Me and Trick Daddy come from a common place

So us gettin' money, that's just a conversation

It's so hard stayin' rich and miss the confrontations

Cigars in the oval office, Ronald Reagan

Heard Barack Obama whisper asalaam alaikum

Live for the moment, die for the streets

Bible on the dash, kilos on the seat

I used to see you niggas on my TV screen

And wondered what was life like, was it all a dream?

And then I met you out on LiveNation dates

Came to the realization that your watch was fake

Damn... you nearly broke my heart

I really thought you niggas really owned them cars



I used to look up to you, nigga, uh



Hard to point a finger when you live a life of sin

I'ma bring my niggas with me if I lose or win

Bought a fleet of cars, let the bitches tag along

This little thing of ours, not the ones to tattle on

Omerta the code, Met Ball, parties with Vogue

Still blowin' thick smoke while you powder your nose

Such a head rush until the day the feds rush

That's when you niggas wish you put your bread up

Leased whips, bad blood, that shit'll sink ships

Fast money comin' slow, you better think quick

Rap game, so much fuck shit done

That's why this .45 in my Trukfit trunks

Fuck a skateboard, I went and got a Wraith, boy

Catholic record labels, niggas gettin' raped, boy

Birdman's a priest, moans in his synagogue

Publishin' is a sin, repent, forgive me, Lord

Shots fired, home invasion out on Palm Isle

Red beam detonators, who the bomb now?

Look you in your eyes, nigga, 'fore I say good night

And pray that Mannie Fresh'll get to see the light



Damn, Stunna, I loved you, nigga

Hate it came to this

Maybach Music



You stole them boys pub and bought a foreclosure

Scott Storch demons in it, which is more poison

I handed over records, never charged a coin

But could sense the sentiment, I'm talkin' all along

All Miami issues, Rozay handle for him

Same way Big Ducky do for me in California

Never slippin', got relationships with the trillest niggas

Tony Draper, J Prince and ever Jimmy Henchmen

Plenty killers and I know that Diddy with it

Tyga, chinchilla, really ain't no penny pinchin'

Knew that you would never visit BG

Turk came home, take that boy a three piece

Shootin' dope, usin' coke, movin' like you the Folks

Sacrificin' half our life for your new music cult

You would give us self esteem and motivate our drive

But was in our pockets by the time we count to five

I pray you find the kindness in your heart for Wayne

His entire life, he gave you what there was to gain

I watched this whole debacle so I'm part to blame

Last request, can all producers please get paid?



Can't believe this shit, homie

I still love you, nigga

How the fuck, nigga, you touch half a billion, nigga

And your team starvin', nigga

You on an island, nigga

You came to my city, nigga

I let you in my city, nigga

And what hurt me the most, nigga

Is how you did my brother Khaled, nigga

Khaled was loyal to you, nigga

The pain I seen in my brother's eye, nigga

FaceTimin' my nigga, nigga, he took that to the chin, nigga

That's why my nigga blessed

That's why my nigga Khaled blessed

You put my nigga in the hole, homie

I don't feel you for that, my nigga

That shit hurt me, you under-dig? Uh

It's painful what you see real niggas do when they get the paper

When they get the bag

You can't never forget 'bout lil bruh and them

I'll never forget 'bout lil bruh and them

Lil bruh and them, always remember

Lil bruh and them, this for lil bruh and them

Bust another check and I just bought a new machine

And like the Chargers I'm about to move the team

You bought a Charger, well Gucci bought a Lamborghin'

Baby girl do your thing in your Vera Wang

Ever dealt with a nigga still dealing cocaine

Never made it to the game before it's halftime

Ten stacks for the seats or you can have mine

Never seated by a snitch, they give me bad vibes

Pop a bottle every time you niggas flatline

Lot of bitches but I focus on my fab five

Made her count a half a ticket on the cab ride

Bitch ass nappy girl, you need that rich shit

It take real heart to wanna be a rich bitch

She was the youngest and her mama had six kids

Called her a dummy but she turned into a rich bitch

Run with a nigga with some money out in Memphis

She was posting pictures of the gifts that he would gift her

But the pussy goes to the richest nigga

And guess what? Rozay is that nigga!



She on my dick, she on my dick

She on my dick, she on my dick

She on my dick, she on my dick

I once got no allowance, now I got the crown

I said I was The Boss, nobody made a sound

Really had to see them things, this level story tellin'

Who else could flip a chorus into 40 million?

Out in Cannes with Leonardo DiCaprio

While out on bond, pray I go to trial rapido

8 felonies, tellin' me wanna give me life

Every nut I bust really, I gotta do it twice

Ricky Ronaldo, really when I'm in Portugal

I may name my daughter Hermes

Get Margiela to decorate the new birds nest

20 million up in Merrill Lynch

I met his chick, he haven't seen her since

Through the city, I'm still floatin' like a magic carpet

She stop me for a selfie, I just want the knowledge

Expressin' what you think'll send your kids to college

Or be a Geechi nigga just to keep the Bentley polished

Do it for the dear departed, fuck a Ben Carson

Empire rented, you made a nigga a target

Only one that's smokin' up in Goldman Sachs

When I'm the only one that's rollin' like a quarter back

And I never put it in my government

'Cause I never put on for the government

Pussy niggas lookin' for me, I'ma give it to 'em

Santorini, Greece, sex in the swimmin' pool

If her pussy dry, call her Beetle Juice

I'm baby makin' in the Malvides

Put up all the yachts, pulled out the jet skis

Khaled hit me on the FaceTime [It's Billy!]

I'm the fliest nigga on his baseline

She see the sneakers and she see the stones

Fat boy run the city, seated in the throne

Went to war, beaker scores, they continue to fall

Corner stores, wait up, hold all these wonderful laws

So much violence in the streets, ask the powers that be

Kiss my daughter on the cheek and I'm strapped as we speak

Dirty money get bloody, you still see the gun wounds

But what's funny are the ones that we put the guns to

Fuck 'em all, kill or be killed, it's still a thug rule

Back of class, high on grass, 'til I said ""fuck school!""

What's meant to be is meant to be, I rather you than me

Die with pride, forty shells on the murder scene

Rolls Royce leather stitching in the steering wheel

Ninth album, Ice Cube, nigga kill at will

Had to balance, Double M is the imperial

Niggas pay respect, they mail it in an envelope

Fucking centerfolds like I still be dealing dope

Probably would if you're talking like fifty or more

So creative, co-creator, family the motivator

Project buildings, lot of feeling, karma my codefendant

Pot to piss in, not a ribbon, never forgot a Christmas

Father figure not around, that's such a major difference

I would play with all my homies' gifts

I understood I didn't wanna trip

The lack of didn't tap my confidence

Matter fact that's how I mastered a couple things

Went from not having to sheer opulence

Maybach with the drapes like an apartment in it

Whole hood know it, only one that's white on white

Name ringing like DJ Clue on a Friday night

Just got some real estate out in Dubai

Nation of Islam, they say I might have a few ties

Talking tall brothers with the dark shades

Shed light, bringing niggas out the dark age

Sitting in the court with a sharp fade

Having sentimental thoughts about this Caucasian

Six million in the hole, still feeling short-changed

Reprimanded by someone who's snorting cocaine

Frank Hampton was an angel, may his name ring

Crackers wanna kill me for the same thing

Ain't no financial aid out in Notre Dame

Activist sipping Actavis, tryna pour away



Uh, yeah

Uh, yeah

Uh, yeah



You know how it is

New levels, new devils

The cheddar breed jealousy, at hella speed but it's whatever

Mercedes driver

85'er, enlightener, collapsable sun visor

The half moon identifies

The son of God, son of man

Son of Sam, young with the blam

Stick or get stuck, get killed to get buck

A blessing of luck

I love all, test me, trust not

Above all but young niggas address me as such

Like Hannibal Barker, running through Carthage

Pan of our watches, conquer the nonsense, conquering lion

Armée var, Son, God combined in one

Most prolific, you off point

Like the coke addicted lawyer, Klienfeldt's gun

Tell the waiter bring over that Moscow Mule

Tell them haters get over it, Nas still rules

To money makers and niggas who murk you out

And beat the death penalty on reversal trial

Niggas versatile



Uh, yeah

Uh, yeah

Uh, yeah

But when it's out of your control

Then it's the powers that be, be

Renovating the ghettoes, moving me elsewhere

Daddy didn't see pension they took his healthcare

Affordable housing and they fed us welfare

Showed us Tony Montana, teachers couldn't care less

A young prince in Miami, son of a pharaoh

This is deeper than raps, I can't run from the echoes

And I hear the screams

Under my mattress box springs, I still see the C.R.E.A.M

Mac 11 next to Grammy invitations

I'm never quiet, tell my niggas all my aspirations

No more beefing with rappers

It's just murder or nothing

New positions to master, I perfected the others

Niggas shoot for the Magic, never heard of Matumbo

These are lucrative assets, golden words that will mumble you



This the biggest...

Corner store was the stage, I needed management

In a mansion that I could squeeze another phantom in

Negative people just seem to fail first

I said I'm a genius, put in the legwork

You step to my niggas, suggest you stay alert

No, I've never been lenient, nor a man of mercy

I stick my dick in her tell her my net worth

Then we stare at each other and see who catch first

A pretty chick, she resembles Stacy Dash

If it was her, she had to kiss my feet and lick my ass

Pussy nigga want war, til' it's ""bonjour""

Those hitters sitting a bomb outside your mom door

Got your people alarmed cause we the armed force

Easy as leaking a song before I go on tour



Uh

Gang violence ongoing, let's fight our own wars

Chicago been out of hand, the city lost its soul

Funeral every weekend or either you cremated

Homie's son, he been murdered, he didn't seem faded

Holding guns on the gram, out of my league baby

Real killers and hitters would rather live nameless

I got a homie I know with a twenty body count

Maybe once or twice a month he leave the house

Older brother, type to get a curly perm

Pappy Mason type respect for holding thirty birds

Never was a gangster, I just wanted in

No longer could I deny that I wanted a Benz

Booby gave me blessings and a root for me to win

I showed him my ambition in two different fields

Also, said I was a rapper, Booby here it is

I'mma blow this forty on me, you can save the lectures

Watch your dog die as my gun bark

These helicopters rise for the one in charge

My pockets fat enough to catch a nigga if I fall

Love to see a pretty bitch rolling a wood leaf

Phone ringing, smiling like I got some gold teeth

I caught a bird, jet smarter on the Maltese

I left a chick in NBC out on the northeast

Such a feeling, niggas killing for my poetry

Tryna go back underground, that's once they notice me

I'm really not the one you wanna handle funny

At the Grammys, my lil' homie had the hammer on him

You niggas out of style with your wedding vows

I still be making rounds like I'm Kevin Liles

Time to set a date for trial, we never settle out

Them Lamborghini doors, you see me stepping out

Dreaming of things we can't afford

I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now

Get all the sneakers, not enough clothes

You can have the ex, I got enough hoes

You can have my next, once we a month old

Reptile black [?] handle

Now the trophy on the mantle, well I got a Phantom

Being down and out was inconceivable

When you find out the one you love is just misleading you

Tryna make a living, remain spiritual

Egotistical ways I embraced back in middle school

If the chick was game, we would run a train

Send her home on a bus, then forget her name

But now the bitches be the realest ones

I done cried on the shoulder when I'm feeling numb

See the man getting life and never shed a tear

But his daughter in the night never pierced her ears

Time will come when all that nice shit disappears

Why you think I'm on the night shift with the [?]

Mind frame of that boy that was found (?)

[?] you can tell I been around 'cane

Double R, Ricky Ross, bitch we been the game

Bottom of the black market, tryna rise the game



[Verse 2: Rick Ross] 

My inner Andre 3000

So many false allegations , is my image tainted

3 weeks in the hole, as if a nigga heinous

As I'm pacing in the cell all this pictures painted

All i wanted was some Bel Air [?]

[?] just because I'm famous

Or is it cause' I'm rich and I know what pain is?

Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman

Now accept these words as they came from Eminem

Democratic party sentenced to the pendulum

Killing them, I voted for Andre Benjamin

Head of black music do you know what rhythm is?

Stick your head in the basket, it gets venomous

Straight clear my chicks finish my sentences

Time to squash to beef, I kill a nemesis

Show up at the wedding in my Timberlands

And for the record, know my best man will kill a bitch



[Chorus: John Legend] 

So if I die before I wake, say I, I lived my way

Never said I would be perfect

Never said that I deserved it

Never said I wouldn't lie

Never said I wouldn't make my mum cry

But if I'm gon' die, I believe it's alright

It was so amazing, so amazing

It was so amazing, so amazing

I wouldn't change a thing, no no no

It was so amazing, so amazing

It was so amazing, so amazing

I wouldn't change a thing"

Here I go
I went unconscious, I woke up to see my mama smile
She told me no more promethazine, that'll make her proud
Think about it, damn I had to think about it

Gimme a second, mama, lemme think about it

I went unconscious, I woke up to see my mama smile

She told me no more promethazine, that'll make her proud

Think about it, damn I had to think about it

Gimme a second, mama, lemme think about it

Never had the chance to tell my dad I was a Yankee fan

True love is unconditional, money don't make a man

First time me in a batting cage, I knew I had a gift

Which I had to skip, I'm at the car wash trying to make a tip

Positivity is all I got to give

When we was kids, it was still now it's time to live

That's why I throw a pinkie ring up when I post a pic

It's for my niggas on they dick, look what this nigga did

Think about it, think about it

40 M's in my timbs, still ridin' rims

Word on the streets, they say that nigga get a lot of cake

I take the time, I kiss both cheeks on my mamas face



Smile!

The world had to make me a man, but I'll always be your child!

Mama just smile!

Most importantly, I want you to be proud! Mama just smile!



No I never really mind that we caught the bus

Or that we always stand in line, I'm talkin all of us

It made me stronger, it made me quicker on my feet

All the gain she gave me the love that she would teach

Turn me onto real estate we bought us 50 homes

Who really gonna be your shoulder when your kid is gone

Who really gonna be your rider when the Bentleys gone?

Or when they singin like a choir in a Christmas song?

Mama! Always depend on my mama

Just bought another Benz for my mama

I always keep it real with my mama

She harder than a rock

Throw her parties on the block for my mama

I just wanna see my mama smile



I am a love

Your flesh and your blood

Unconditional love inside of me

And we're all that we got, father or not

I make sure that you smile because of me

Smile for me mama



Makes me happy just to see a smile on her face

Perfect mother and I love you, tell you every day

You always was a black queen, mama

You showed me all the best things, mama



Just smile!

The world had to make me a man, but I'll always be your child!

Mama just smile!

Just smile!

Most importantly, I want you to be proud! Mama just smile!

I am a love. Your flesh and your blood. Unconditional love inside of me

Mama just smile!!

Mama just smile!!"

Mess around and die before 21 out here
Mamas stressing, seen them ratchets in the dresser
She not asking questions
She seen the vests and seen other kids in the casket resting
Weed so loud they got surround sound

Smoking good shit cause they tryna take me back to some hood shit

Any club, any fly fair

If they start shooting all they remember is Nas was there

Some homies of yours bangin' affiliation on their personal time

Conflict with business can hurt down the line

It's something that you ain't have nothing to do with

Your man conversation end up getting you hit

Learn how to draw the line from when we hang with the shooters

Strippers, dealers and killers, leaches and opportunists

Where I come from it's ruthless, air you out from the Ubers

Tutored by coke movers, put holes through ya'

You wouldn't get that from me though, you'd overlook me

Looking like I just get to that money and stay in some pussy

Got a pretty real dope life

Fly nigga from the other side, hecklers, PKs, 9's and .45's

7.62's, deer-hunting rifle shells, life is hell

Pussy sweeter than wine tasting

But we won't self-indict ourselves

Be our own prosecutor, won't 25-to-life ourselves

We bout that moolah, rich shooters



You getting money, got a body then you one of us

Trust

You getting money, got a body then you one of us



Calculating, touching money, these niggas masturbating

Tailored clothes, fashion magazines, they fascinated

Double-M umbrella, the feds call it tax shelter

Hit a million, they conspire to send the rats at you

Cha-cha-cha-cha, slide, catch me on that other side

Foreign cars, private jets, high rate of homicide

Marc Jacobs chocolate diamonds, they for my white bitch

Atheist, but her pussy could be so righteous

Follow the rules, never let a man take your jewels

And if he do, double back make sure he make the news

It ain't arrest, they ain't a pussy til it's time to bust

You gettin' money, got a body then you one of us



You gettin' money, got a body then you one of us

Trust

You gettin' money, got a body then you one of us



Dice game, head crackers, time to get it back

Only one in the studio that could get a pack

Raw deal, rob a nigga like it's on my appeal

Closest friends do us best, regardless how I feel

Went to the line and got em bitches on the same day

Straight to the jeweler, and did the watches the same way

Young sav on face time, talking cake time

Next crib I build got to cross state lines

Niggas hate how I wear my heart on my sleeve

And half the team, got the choppers with the shoulder slings

It ain't a rust, stay in the trap til you a hundred up

You gettin' money, got a body then you one of us



You gettin' money, got a body then you one of us

They say I always left a paper trail
Duffle bag in the attack now how that paper smell (wooh)
And I musta left it there for several years

In case of emergencies go get a set of wheels

Burning tobacco with my ancestors

Learning on my transgressions

Accepting that street niggas we live by different rules

Pill poppin' everyday I'm in a different mood

They scream our names since we walk the halls (Boss)

With everything to gain only fear allah

Full metal jacket still the wardrobe

Never waist a prayer for peace in a warzone

Pray to keep the lights on your porch on

Even better pray I get to see my boy grow

Before Instagram we did it up in the ozone



Let's go deep into my cold mind

First one I got it on I got it on the goal line

Fully automatic weapons for my O line

Wanna buy the team they say I need a cosign

I got a beacon jumping out the gym

My new freak she Puerto Rican trying to real me in

Hit the homey from the hood I told him fill me in

On top of that he said he good I told him bring me 10

Gentrification across the barland

I thought the goal was get rich be a married man

Never question my vision I seen atrocities

But I also see profit on selling properties

Still rising enterprising young entrepreneur

Ostentatious globe-trotting out with Lira Galore (Young Coco)

Six mill I'm born I told them they can keep the change

Pick me up in that new rrari swerving lane to lane



Nigga close but it's no cigar

So it better be that Ghost or that double R

My alma mater is serving fed time

See the streets before god cut off his deadline

Damaged yard so tomorrow grows the prominence

Bastard case you can see that was some common sense

I entertain niggas under poverty lines

So paint these pretty pictures as part of my rhymes

Crack spots block to block I've been a benefactor

I don't think you understand the type of chips I'm after

Corporation but they run them like their small time

We never see eye to eye if you have a soft side

I told you pussy niggas let the lions in

I told these pussy niggas let the lions in

Your record labels left with rigor mortis

I just closed another deal worth another 40

Diamonds all through the watch and you should see the band

Got her selling pussy for the love of the money

Indictments coming and I really think they coming for me

In the box Chevy pussy nigga gunning for me

Catch a flight to Paris time to get some other money

Get it down even if a nigga momma know me

Put it down quarter key in every category

If you real all we kill for is color money

Fuck where you from cuz all we deal with is color money

Or get another double R to cut the top with

Or hit the booty club to go and get some pussy whip

I might buy a bitch a Benz if he pussy whip

Only nigga that you know with two NASCAR's

Sell a lot of record but I make a brick jump

We back to back and down to whack a nigga unborn

Miami niggas got them changing all the gun laws

So run Forrest got some shooters and they dying too

Survive who call this a color money conversation

A hundred stacks will cover everything I'm contemplating

Full confrontation home invasion for the quarter key

You wanna see?

The red ring nigga looking like a fair case

Fuck all these rappers real talk cuz I ain't fucking with em

Since I came in the game, you niggas philosophies changed
Chasing money, Geto Boys and Underground Kingz
Wrote the rules on how to ball without a bodyguard
Learn to move or get hit with the John Gotti charge

I pray you niggas never lose a minute to a cell

Or lose your manhood in a yard, painted nails

Fairy tales of pretty bitches livin' prosperous

Your text is quoted, dead bodies never bothered us

At the park was a thing, but we skipped the swing

Very place I first seen my first triple beam

Dirty game, pillow talkin' witcha mayne

Giver her dope dick and all the things that she would say

She the one that put me up on Netflix

At the concerts I keep her on the guest list

Freaky things, sex scenes, a bowl of ice cream

My advice to her is time to trade to my team

No shots, but I write all of my raps

Post means I got the toaster and the beam on yah

Broken holes the size of a token and the barrels to smoke yah

Know it's home invasion cause his front door is still open

I'm the big homie on these missions, little niggas listen

Survived the drive by but they gave you the shakes

Know you tellin', nigga, they played us the tapes

Screamin' Maybach but I came in the Wraith

Put you in the casket, now stay in your place

Where I'm from gangbang is a thing of the past

Only thing matter if you black, you getting some cash

If the groupie fuckin', then give her a pass

When she lookin' for instructions, I give her a class

Get Rich or Die Tryin', yeah that was 50 plan

Filed the chapter 11, guess the nigga kidneys failed

Bitch so bad, she in a bidding war

If she needed bone marrow, I woulda did it for her

Went from slice and dice pineapple and ice pear

Addicted to this way of life, never have any care

Took my Rolex and gave me an ankle monitor

Fascinated allegation kilo grams of that coke

Roll with 25 and never knew his social number

Mac-11 for that Gucci belt to go up under

Black man's pride, see it in my eyes

Fayette county prosecutor want to take a nigga house

So much disdain for the police

Clan rally niggas swing from them old trees

Wood wheel in the Wraith and the skinny ties

Crocodile python seats and the carbon fiber

Hot boy, stash box. and the gas tank

Man of leisure to the top I took the staircase

[Hook: Jeremih]

Hey girl, lemme tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fucking

Hey girl, lemme tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fucking

Lay you on your back, got your legs in the air like a peace sign

Lay you on your back, got your legs wide open like a peace sign

We can make it nasty, shake your head like Cassie

I be counting this money

You can get freaky while I'm rolling my Cali"

Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody



[Verse 1: Rick Ross]

The swag non-stop, the paper won't quit

Yet it's fly nigga, how she wanna skate on my dick

The all black drapes, hollow wall full of safes

My gas on fleek, jet fuel for the weak

These niggas wanna tweet, my niggas wanna eat

Down south dope boy, D-boy, nigga eat

All red Yeezy's, women who be on TV

(?) on the marble, only down

Tellin' jokes, blowin' smoke, defining (?) are the chokes

Fine dishes, pretty bitches on our ghost (?)

I'm tipping through on my shorty, eyes look Tiffany blue

Methodous flows killing these niggas, christians approved

Very wild, no photos, these niggas rarely smile

Only problem is staying low on the paper (?)

Scared to come to town, really?

How you niggas sound

I get my bitch to come pick you up, just to gun you down



[Hook: Mary J. Blige]

You only get one life

That's enough if you do it right

Opinions don't phase me

Your hate ain't gonna change me, no

But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody



[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

Fame is a flaw, I give the game to you raw

Number one in the south, she can see that from afar

She can tell by the car, double R on the plate

Rolls Royce over those black market bumping in the rave

Bitch nigga with poor taste, starve while y'all ate

I put my niggas on, they got 20 more on the weight

We all gotta die so that's double M to the day

I know the devil try so I get on my knees and pray

Jesus still walks, we marchin' in a parade

Black and white holding hands

While letting that thing blaze

Pistol on my waist, I can feel a police chase

Homie cutting crack like home made cheese cake

I get right, I get it right, I double back, I get it right

We make mistakes, but baby now is the time to get it right

I see you on that Jeep, but really what you living like



[Hook: Mary J. Blige]

You only get one life

That's enough if you do it right

Opinions don't phase me

Your hate ain't gonna change me, no

But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody



[Verse 3: Rick Ross]

My heart nickle plated, these haters they all hating

Hate to see me smile, hate to know I made it

Hate to see me toast with my niggas, I'm motivated

Hate to see me with these women at these publications

I still get it poppin', let me get them keys

I still do the proper, do the BET's

I still roll it proper, let my niggas feast

Still in that 'rarri blowing hella breeze



[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]

I'm doing big things, I got big dreams

Move out of my way, if you ain't for me

Feel like a winter, I put in work

So many years, man I deserve to be celebrated on every level

If you can't take it, that's your problem

I'm gonna thrive, I'm gonna shine

I'm gonna live my life

But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just running my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake
I tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises

Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex

I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit



Sorry, don't turn back the clock

Baby I took advantage cause I knew you

Wouldn't believe it, so I used you

I'm sorry, oh I'm sorry don't make it right, I know



We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist

Conversation, she lick every tattoo that's on my face

Like a thug, I just wanna fuck on it, that's every day

Temporary separations, confessing my mistakes

She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt

You knew shit, but she can't tell me that it's real first

A lot of lies apologised, the thirst real

When she hit this thinking to herself, ""Damn this verse real""

Read about it Vegas, I made this with Merc

Send the bottles to her table then made love on the jet

Temporary thrills, all these women you think I told you

My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs

I been a boss before I ever recorded Meek song

Mill and Cash on the gram, they trending meat chong

In the D in my G and he throwing that peace on

Every picture that you post we comment for this one



I'm just a typical ordinary nigga

But I know that I can't change for you

All this time I blamed you cause I know what I'm doing

Stabbing on your heart again, relationship ruined

I tried to change but I'm always out, fucking around in the club

Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up

My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up

I feel like shit, know I ain't shit but I'm



Sorry, don't turn back the clock

Baby I took advantage cause I knew you

Wouldn't believe it, so I used you

I'm sorry, oh I'm sorry don't make it right, I know



Like Jordan, baby girl you deserve a winner

Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger

Hustle from my heart so every night I can deliver

Saying sorry, lean up, way up in your liver

Boss, the red bottom's got you walking funny

Get you an agent, she balling and all she talk is money

Take you shopping, baby boy ain't no salary caps

She get it popping so you better bring battery packs

Perfect time to relax

Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match

They all watch me cause the moves I make out they budget

Diamond digits, six figures on my shorty nugget



I tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed

Gave you my word but they were just broken promises

Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex

I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit"

Sometimes, being in the position I am, with no malicious intent, my nigga, you can take it how you want it. I see it from both sides, I feel a nigga pain
Learn to walk a tightrope
Ever seen a rich nigga go broke?
They putting liens on a nigga's things
Publicize your demise, and by all means

Your family fortune is forever what you stood on

Sold dreams, fantasies that put the hood on

You reap what you sow, and they speaking repossessions

To the culture itself, these are powerful lessons

These niggas always smiled when I came around

They let you know my reputation when you in my town

A real nigga, you gonna know that by the contract

Bottom line blood, show me where them one's at

That paper it get funny when publishing is involved

Mechanicals never mattered because that was your dog

Now you hands-on, but things don't ever seem right

You make a call to give your lawyer the green-light

He look into it then hit you up with the bad news

It's so familiar, he did the same with the last dudes

Mafioso, baby girl, cash rules

Every dollar accounted for, double M the crew



Death Row, fast life

Foreclosed on my past life

The white man call us stupid niggas

We spend it all, nothing for our children

Had it all, now it's repossessed

Can't feed the clique cutting bad checks

Time to learn boy, that cash rules

Success is a precious jewel



Planting poison in a nigga mind

Chilling with your boys when it's time to grind

We both come from those humble beginnings

Still can't believe we never followed each other on Twitter

Funny thing is the animosity money brings

Real niggas out of style we may be one in three

Back against the wall outnumbered by fuckboys

One bullet, one target, one choice

You can take an L or take the shell

It's still double M still making mills

Made niggas respect my hustle on both coasts

I put the word out to see who hit back with the lowest

I need a hit handled, put me in touch with the closest

You still digging through ashtrays killing the roaches

And I never took an L back when Meek fell

Just drove the numbers all the way back up at retail



Death Row, fast life

Foreclosed on my past life

The white man call us stupid niggas

We spend it all, nothing for our children

Had it all, now it's repossessed

Can't feed the clique cutting bad checks

Time to learn boy, that cash rules

Success is a precious jewel



Can't be writing checks with your eyes closed

While you living out of homes in different time zones

Mind blown finna strip you out your rhinestones

Pistol to your ear, this that level I'm on

I apologize woadie but this all I got

Everybody in this office we could die tonight

I never met an artist who fully recouped

These the deals the deal dealers wanna deal to you

Young niggas, time to act your wage

Buying belts you seen on other niggas waists

Hoes fucking for follows, they wanna post online

Whole time, shorty knowing I'm the gold mine

Put it on all he needed was a co sign

Black minks and gloves, nigga, the whole nine

TV on the Rolls, shit, I had to hold mine

You'll foreclose or fold just for soul signs



Death Row, fast life

Foreclosed on my past life

The white man call us stupid niggas

We spend it all, nothing for our children

Had it all, now it's repossessed

Enchanted by women who speak nasty

Tip toeing to court, went there for the past week

Leaning on my lawyer pinky looking glassy

Charges dropped, these plaintiffs just wanna tax me

Secret service wanna see me driving taxis

Hug my attorney and then we do the money dance

Whitey Bulge' your horse, soldier leaving Vietnam

Pledge allegiance to the flag

Where we keep it 100 and get your money back

Pull a plug, brain dead, dope game nigga

Knew the rolls was fake and so we brought the real with us

Repertoire hustle such a tenacity

High roller, bet us another masterpiece

More Rakim then maybe Master P

Crazy nigga paid in full I'm tryna buy the beach



Caution, I'll approach you with a business mind

Slight two step as I check the time

Rub my hands when my palms itch

Two private Jets what this nigga's worth

No whip under a hundred grand

Propellers out the window over our lands

Top floors, cop rooms on reservations

Gold in my grave, half a ticket in my coupe

Ex cheerleader flipping now this nigga truth

Money piles have got me out on Sunny Ave

Black with me everywhere I go he'll gun you down

Full clips, magazines yeah the Forbes list

If it's off a nickel recount it, it's boss shit

But when they right we do the money dance

Fly nigga my nigga Randall Cunningham

When she hear the slang then she know the name

Italian coupes for the suits I spend it on the chain

Pool so long we should take a swim

I like that ass fat, I can spread it thin

I wanna see your friends come do the money dance

Uh, I feel wonderful, how about yourself?

You rolling with the real niggas you know we got it



As the world turn and the weed twist

Flew a hundred niggas to Veil on a ski trip

Put away the dope we can see the slopes

We built this shit together why it mean the most

Head on collision somehow I walk away

Give you music for free recouping with the yay

You're rocking with the bowtie Don

In god we trust, I bust and post bond

In the hood we the Run-DMCs

Best quotes and ropes we don't need

Death Row on foul like Cool C

Big flossy the bitches like ""who's he?""

The corvette was a beast I had to lease

Six months then we're free to holler, ""peace""

Dead wrong my nigga, Miami river cops

Leave you floating, hope you getting them ten a pop

Atlanta, Miami, Rosé

We're like 2Pac and Vante

They sent my nigga on house arrest

I'm coming through niggas they ain't stopping this

I bring the beach to the front door

All bitches out the pool we need to park the boat

Turn South Georgia to Florida

And turn the rest over to the lawyers

Cause we ain't tryna hurt nobody

Just tryna bring life to the party

If I ain't change you mind think whatever

One thing you can't change is I changed the weather

And this my Roc-A-Fella flow

And you just on hella dope, I'm hella dope

This for real niggas with Maybachs

All debts forgiven this is the payback

60 thousand in nickle rocks outside the silver fox

Duval County to Virginia , my pockets 'bout to pop

My lil hitta doing 4 he caught a gun charge

Rolling bumpkin backwoods they outta bush park

Position yourself, it's timing that's coming to the end

Caught him slippin', at Simons he tried to get a fit'

It's either

Or baby boy, you can meet the lord

I pray we meet again, maybe we be on one accord

Walking through the flea market

Bouncing like I hit a lick

Going open, the record label just to go legit

Had to car cash on 27th was a pastime

Pay for 60 keys, all at once just like the last time

The jubilation, the euphoria

Pushing a foreign in the morning

Pick your daughter up

Drop your seed off, let the weed up

Slow motion, fast forward till we speed up

Grinding till my new account is fully at ease

Beefing with broke niggas really like pulling my teeth

Get away from me, you looking so suspicious

Light pocket, heavy hearted, you simple minded niggas

Don't be jealous of me, I keep enough foes

Get all the sneakers, not enough clothes

You can have the ex, I got enough hoes

You can have my next, once we a month old

Reptile black [?] handle

Now the trophy on the mantle, well I got a Phantom

Being down and out was inconceivable

When you find out the one you love is just misleading you

Tryna make a living, remain spiritual

Egotistical ways I embraced back in middle school

If the chick was game, we would run a train

Send her home on a bus, then forget her name

But now the bitches be the realest ones

I done cried on the shoulder when I'm feeling numb

See the man getting life and never shed a tear

But his daughter in the night never pierced her ears

Time will come when all that nice shit disappears

Why you think I'm on the night shift with the [?]

Mind frame of that boy that was found (?)

Bottom of the black market, tryna rise the game

My inner Andre 3000

So many false allegations , is my image tainted

3 weeks in the hole, as if a nigga heinous

As I'm pacing in the cell all this pictures painted

All i wanted was some Bel Air [?]

[?] just because I'm famous

Or is it cause' I'm rich and I know what pain is?

Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman

Now accept these words as they came from Eminem

Democratic party sentenced to the pendulum

Killing them, I voted for Andre Benjamin

Head of black music do you know what rhythm is?

Stick your head in the basket, it gets venomous

Straight clear my chicks finish my sentences

Time to squash to beef, I kill a nemesis

Show up at the wedding in my Timberlands

And for the record, know my best man will kill a bitch



[Chorus: John Legend] 

So if I die before I wake, say I, I lived my way

Never said I would be perfect

Never said that I deserved it

Never said I wouldn't lie

Never said I wouldn't make my mum cry

But if I'm gon' die, I believe it's alright

It was so amazing, so amazing

It was so amazing, so amazing

I wouldn't change a thing, no no no

It was so amazing, so amazing

It was so amazing, so amazing

I wouldn't change a thing"

Which I had to skip, I'm at the car wash trying to make a tip

Positivity is all I got to give

No I never really mind that we caught the bus

Or that we always stand in line, I'm talkin all of us

It made me stronger, it made me quicker on my feet

All the gain she gave me the love that she would teach

Turn me onto real estate we bought us 50 homes

Who really gonna be your shoulder when your kid is gone

Who really gonna be your rider when the Bentleys gone?

Or when they singin like a choir in a Christmas song?

Mama! Always depend on my mama

Just bought another Benz for my mama

I always keep it real with my mama

She harder than a rock

Throw her parties on the block for my mama

I just wanna see my mama smile



I am a love

Your flesh and your blood

Unconditional love inside of me

And we're all that we got, father or not

I make sure that you smile because of me

Smile for me mama



Makes me happy just to see a smile on her face

Perfect mother and I love you, tell you every day

You always was a black queen, mama

You showed me all the best things, mama



Just smile!

The world had to make me a man, but I'll always be your child!

Mama just smile!

Just smile!

Most importantly, I want you to be proud! Mama just smile!

Raw deal, rob a nigga like it's on my appeal

Closest friends do us best, regardless how I feel

Went to the line and got em bitches on the same day

Straight to the jeweler, and did the watches the same way

Young sav on face time, talking cake time

Next crib I build got to cross state lines

Niggas hate how I wear my heart on my sleeve

And half the team, got the choppers with the shoulder slings

It ain't a rust, stay in the trap til you a hundred up

Burning tobacco with my ancestors

Learning on my transgressions

Accepting that street niggas we live by different rules

Pill poppin' everyday I'm in a different mood

They scream our names since we walk the halls (Boss)

With everything to gain only fear allah

Never waist a prayer for peace in a warzone

Pray to keep the lights on your porch on

Fully automatic weapons for my O line

Wanna buy the team they say I need a cosign

I thought the goal was get rich be a married man

Never question my vision I seen atrocities

But I also see profit on selling properties

Still rising enterprising young entrepreneur

Ostentatious globe-trotting out with Lira Galore (Young Coco)

Six mill I'm born I told them they can keep the change

Pick me up in that new rrari swerving lane to lane



Nigga close but it's no cigar

So it better be that Ghost or that double R

My alma mater is serving fed time

See the streets before god cut off his deadline

Damaged yard so tomorrow grows the prominence

Bastard case you can see that was some common sense

I entertain niggas under poverty lines

So paint these pretty pictures as part of my rhymes

Crack spots block to block I've been a benefactor

I don't think you understand the type of chips I'm after

Corporation but they run them like their small time

We never see eye to eye if you have a soft side

I told you pussy niggas let the lions in

I told these pussy niggas let the lions in

Your record labels left with rigor mortis

I just closed another deal worth another 40

Trappin for the color money

You know what it is



If you wanna get a block then you should see the man

Diamonds all through the watch and you should see the band

Bottle in the club got me screaming color money

Got her selling pussy for the love of the money

Indictments coming and I really think they coming for me

In the box Chevy pussy nigga gunning for me

Catch a flight to Paris time to get some other money

You still alive cuz you niggas still running from me

Get it down even if a nigga momma know me

Put it down quarter key in every category

If you real all we kill for is color money

Fuck where you from cuz all we deal with is color money

I got a duffle bag that I wanna shop with

Or get another double R to cut the top with

Or hit the booty club to go and get some pussy whip

I might buy a bitch a Benz if he pussy whip



Color money

Color money



Blackjack Black Bottles with the Black Cards

Only nigga that you know with two NASCAR's

Sell a lot of record but I make a brick jump

Make her sign a prenup just to get my dick sucked

Color money got your bitch out on a world tour

My lil homie made a million on his girl tour

We back to back and down to whack a nigga unborn

Miami niggas got them changing all the gun laws

So run Forrest got some shooters and they dying too

I got more money than that pussy that you're signed to

Survive who call this a color money conversation

A hundred stacks will cover everything I'm contemplating

Full confrontation home invasion for the quarter key

Them cheap ass condos ain't the safest place you want to be

Call him a C.O. but you better not go call police

So when I see you I'ma give you what you wanna see

You wanna see?



Color money

Color money



Rob a nigga close to me you better bring it back

Until the day we even steven tell you bring it back

Red rubies on they can't believe a nigga rap

Color money still feed niggas in the trap

You got the Rolie with the red face

The red ring nigga looking like a fair case

Fuck all these rappers real talk cuz I ain't fucking with em

Double M we balling way harder than Puff and em

It ain't no love loss I only see one boss

You looking at him when they got the guns going off

And all the bitches on the staff and they get a check

So bust it open never test a nigga intellect

She addicted to that dope dick. I got her hooked, got her locked, talkin' 'bout Rolls Royces nigga, what else woe? Dope dick, back seat, front seat
Since I came in the game, you niggas philosophies changed
Chasing money, Geto Boys and Underground Kingz
Wrote the rules on how to ball without a bodyguard
Learn to move or get hit with the John Gotti charge

I pray you niggas never lose a minute to a cell

Or lose your manhood in a yard, painted nails

Fairy tales of pretty bitches livin' prosperous

Your text is quoted, dead bodies never bothered us

At the park was a thing, but we skipped the swing

Very place I first seen my first triple beam

Dirty game, pillow talkin' witcha mayne

Giver her dope dick and all the things that she would say

She the one that put me up on Netflix

At the concerts I keep her on the guest list

Freaky things, sex scenes, a bowl of ice cream

My advice to her is time to trade to my team



Dope boy, dope car, I got the dope dick

Dope dick, the bitches love me for the dope dick

Dope dick, I fuck her slow with the dope dick

Slow dick, dope dick, I got the dope dick

Tell her friends she wanna watch you get the dope dick

Black bottles, late night givin' you dope dick



100 room mansions, I paid all of the tax

No shots, but I write all of my raps

3 pointer, Harold Miner when I lean on yah

Post means I got the toaster and the beam on yah

Broken holes the size of a token and the barrels to smoke yah

Know it's home invasion cause his front door is still open

When I give you game, niggas better pay attention

I'm the big homie on these missions, little niggas listen

Survived the drive by but they gave you the shakes

Know you tellin', nigga, they played us the tapes

Screamin' Maybach but I came in the Wraith

Put you in the casket, now stay in your place

Where I'm from gangbang is a thing of the past

Only thing matter if you black, you getting some cash

If the groupie fuckin', then give her a pass

When she lookin' for instructions, I give her a class



Dope boy, dope car, I got the dope dick

Dope dick, the bitches love me for the dope dick

Dope dick, I fuck her slow with the dope dick

Slow dick, dope dick, I got the dope dick

Tell her friends she wanna watch you get the dope dick

Black bottles, late night givin' you dope dick



Out in Philly I got Courtney off in the Bentley with me

Niggas hatin' on her [?] I hear other opinions

Well educated and she got the strap

On the road to riches, bitch I can rewrite the map

Still stuffin' money in a minivan

200 acres, goofy I just built the Disneyland

Get Rich or Die Tryin', yeah that was 50 plan

Filed the chapter 11, guess the nigga kidneys failed

Bitch so bad, she in a bidding war

If she needed bone marrow, I woulda did it for her

Went from slice and dice pineapple and ice pear

Addicted to this way of life, never have any care



Dope boy, dope car, I got the dope dick

Dope dick, the bitches love me for the dope dick

Dope dick, I fuck her slow with the dope dick

Slow dick, dope dick, I got the dope dick

Is it jealousy or am I cursed by the gods
My son's mother don't know when or where to start
All the years that I known her, trick never had a job
Unemployed that'll get a bitch depressed
But unlike them other, boys she watched me kill 'em with finesse

I took a turn pussy boy, pick up a book and learn

Have your ass in a church before I end the verse

Rims on the whip got it looking hypnotic

Stuffing money in my pockets as you niggas watching

Crocodile python, all my ice on

And ain't nobody fucking with me while the mics on

She so ecstatic when I fuck her with the lights on

I feel the same when my niggas send the kites home



Damn, why they want to stick me for my paper?

They want the deeds to my fruit of labor

Every time I turn around

Lawsuits put a lean on a king crown

Ten million was the last check

Devil on the deal, the nigga death in debt

They want to own every thing I own

They sends drones to survey my home

Suits designed to protect my wealth

Bloody Glock 40 to protect myself



Cubans on my neck looking like a python

On the couches I'm the one they got their eyes on

Skip your name, now they want to know your tax bracket

Tell 'em that you with me and the pussy's automatic

I paid dues in these streets

I gave so much I got nothing to lose in these streets

Family asked me am I in Illuminati

Beat twenty cases like John Gotti

White man fear a nigga with a free mind

And if you disagree tell him that he can free mine

Took my Rolex and gave me an ankle monitor

So many angles these haters'll start popping up

Renounced my citizen and move to Singapore

Couple tax breaks all accounts offshore



Damn, why they want to stick me for my paper?

They want the deeds to my fruit of labor

Every time I turn around

Lawsuits put a lean on a king crown

Ten million was the last check

Devil on the deal, the nigga death in debt

They want to own every thing I own

They sends drones to survey my home

Suits designed to protect my wealth

Bloody Glock 40 to protect myself



She fell in love with the flow, such a beautiful stroke

Fascinated allegation kilo grams of that coke

Roll with 25 and never knew his social number

Mac-11 for that Gucci belt to go up under

Black man's pride, see it in my eyes

Fayette county prosecutor want to take a nigga house

So much disdain for the police

Clan rally niggas swing from them old trees

Wood wheel in the Wraith and the skinny ties

Crocodile python seats and the carbon fiber

Hot boy, stash box. and the gas tank

Man of leisure to the top I took the staircase



Damn, why they want to stick me for my paper?

They want the deeds to my fruit of labor

Every time I turn around

Lawsuits put a lean on a king crown

Ghost writer blunt lighter
Write a rappers song then go buy a home
Lyrics they recite these are words I own

Every album that I made I made it on my own

Melodies that I would barter any label the starter

Any nigga with cheddar I bet I can make it better

Wanna live the life so they gotta pay the fee

Last ten years everybody came to me

Polations propositions bottom bitches washing dishes

No auditions for these bitches many scriptures weve written

Came from the mud I use to piss in the tub

Never felt loved and I considered you blood

Thousand for the verse and ill throw in the chorus

Slip-N-Slide fucked me friendship was aborted

Publishing was something I would have to earn back

So I wrote so many songs I would deserve that

In return I wrote them things that were aww to the world

Cuz they were some names many names that's my word to confirm

Fell in love with the travel carry ons and what have you

If a nigga came at you then he was trying to pat you

Ghost writer put a check on a niggas head

You never knew all at the table cuz he hid his hand

Remember receiving words of wisdom from Jimmy Henchman

I lit a blunt in his honor when he received his sentence

So many successful entertainers with tax problems

DMX went homeless and heard he back robbing

Rosay won't be a old nigga with back problems

In the back of the Maybach with black Tanya

When it comes to the anthems I done penned me a few

LMAFO been my style they about to get sued

My egos intact my pen is unique

Any pressure we come with sticks like they do at Philippe's

God gave me a gift therefor I shared it with them

Ghostwriter publisher such a beautiful friend

We give them the slang we lease them the swag

Tell them where they can hang tell them what they should claim

Cheers to hustlers bitches who wanna fuck us

Ghostwriter never knowing when they are coming to touch us

My team in fatigues diamonds drip to my knees

Mike Caren a leach you'll all be deceased

Culture is mine these words I define

If you need you a hit I could give you some lines

I could pick you the beat I should write you the hook

You just sit back and smoke all royalties took

Did you ever have the tools to really honor me

Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match

They all watch me cause the moves I make out they budget

Had tears in my eyes as you took your oath

Sweaty palms have on niggas who be touchin' dope

Open the doors, smell the Pyrex in the air

I'm dealin' raw, D-boys so debonair

Told the bitches we was brothers, shared the same people

Introduce you to my mother, made sure you eatin'

Fuck interest as long as you pull it off the lock

Hoes on the fuck, haters wanna hate

Certified sack boy, black Ronald Reagan

Double M no longer that Buick Regal money

Nickel rock niggas so don't make me put a kilo on it

Negotiating for it or either we take it

Niggas even shooting choppers in a fuckin' cadence

Fell out with some people that I still love

I guess that's how it goes when it's real blood

I remember counting cash standing in the trap

I turned my hat to the back, had a hundred stacks

60 m's later and 300 tax

Still losing weight with the south on my back, nigga

Taken for granted, love is null and void

No longer one and few, young Langston Hughes

Jewish intuition, I'm followin' cues

Niggas own Versace, don't know Nikki Giovanni

Obligated, surrounded, when you are often hated

Left a bag of that dope when they flew off to Vegas

It was written, Mr. Jones, a different picture

Strong as bones like Corleones, the realest figuers

Speakin' in native tongues, me, myself and I

Through Michael Rapaport eyes, it's just a lost trial

Mama's trying to save me

But she don't know I'm trying to save her

Man, them niggas tried to play me

Man, 'til I got this paper

You're nobody 'till somebody kills you



""Blast for me"" -- the last words from my nigga

On the pavement, born killers, body shivers

Drug money, dollar figures

Hustlers moving out of rentals

All the war is mental

Having sushi down in Nobu

Strapped like an Afghan soldier

Nowhere to go to so it's bang

No survivors, only riders on my rider

Murder rate rises, stalking niggas on their IG's

Never IB, still solo, underarm is still Polo

No wire, on fire

My desire for fine things made me a liar

A shooter, getting high feeling like it's voodoo

Nine lives, SK with the cooler

Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E

I pray you smoke with me

Go to bed with a kilo like a c-note

Janet Reno, we all we got the creed to Nino

Pretty cars in the driveway

If you cut it then you sideways

Double up, crime pays



Mama's trying to save me

But she don't know I'm trying to save her

Man, them niggas tried to play me

You're nobody 'till somebody kills you



You fucking wanna walk around with these niggas?

What the fuck is their culture?

Where the fuck is their souls at?

What defines you?

These niggas with these fucking silly looks on their faces

You wanna walk around with them or you wanna walk with God, nigga?

Make up your got damn mind



I'm from where the streets test you

Niggas mix business and pleasure

Where the cocaine measure

The narcotics is our product

The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it

New Mercedes as it peels off

Nothing penetrates the steel doors

Gang signs, see 'em all

I said my prayer as I'm counting sheep

Never really athletic, but I play for keeps

Do you feel me?

The mortician, the morgue filling with more snitches

We kill 'em and taking their bitches, R.I.P

Chinchillas on a winter night

Black bottles when the feeling like you wanna know what winter's like

And I'm never on that tour bus

Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's, there's two of us

Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy

My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, make me filthy

Touch mine until you receive and kill

Like I'm knowing every heathen will

Closed the deal with Steven Hill

We Magic City of the networks

Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net works



Mama's trying to save me

But she don't know I'm trying to save her

Man, them niggas tried to play me

Man, 'til I got this paper

You're nobody 'till somebody kills you



Fuck you wanna talk about?

Fucking jewelries and Bentley's and Hublot's

And fucking art that niggas ain't got on their fucking walls

And fucking mansions niggas ain't got

Niggas can't even pay the IRS, let alone their fucking staff, nigga

You gotta tell the truth, man

The truth'll set you free, son

The truth will set you free"

Five shots to the stomach, 2Pac gift pack

It's death row, conspiracy theories

Concealed indictments handed to the grand jury

Get some money now, you hated by your own kind

The home invasion done by niggas in your bloodline

GABOS, game ain't based on sympathy

So he put a hit on his cousin in 18th

A sweet potato pie, oh me, oh my

Showing no remorse watching the others cry

Heroin sales, detectives'll sell

A lot of yellow tape, where that Obama care?

This the mob, bitch, silk underwear

Yeezy concerts, Kim Instagrams

Niggas hating, though they studied my moves

I'm like Farrakhan, in view of hundreds of Jews

Two attempts on my life, they threatened venues

Can't you see what I am? The hustle continue

I bought more jewels, I ordered the Wraith

I got a new style of shoes, match the watch in the face

Bill Belichick, coaching and calling the shots

Throw a yellow flag, pussy nigga body drops

Then we celebrate, black bottles pop

Time to elevate, we re-open shop

Wale a genius, Meek Mill a superstar

My new crib in Phoenix, ten car garage

Patek Philippe, platinum Audemars

Ain't no tags needed, nigga, I own them cars

I know them bitches, we met them broads

Never loved one, fucked them all

I'm a fucking dog, Ricky fucking Ross

Nigga, Birkin bags just for my runner-ups

But my main bitch she get the main dish

Not the old range, that was a lame bitch

Brazilian weave, she say I came quick

I let her see a hundred ki's, a gift from St. Nick

Moving bricks like it's Black Friday

She gotta fuck me or call me a fat crybaby

Looking over my shoulder, I can't trust a soul

Bought a spot in Anguilla just for me and my ho

Glock .40, even when I shower

Chrome .22 in my swimming towel

Mob ties and I pray the music set me free

May the powers that be better let me be

I can have you and your team finalized

All your kids screaming at Mount Sinai

Holy Ghost, the divine spirit

My heart pure, he a real nigga

She let me fuck early so she trustworthy

Her pussy sacred so she getting all the purses

In his name I'm Supreme Lord

The Book of Leviticus is the springboard

Jesus Christ, look at this nigga's ice

Better yet, look at this nigga's life

I'm walking on air



You already know, I give and go and I get that dope

Nigga with that O, I move that shit like tic-tac-toe

And these be niggas hating like ''Meek Mill, how you get that ho?''

Cause I get that dough, and I switch that flow

Just check my style, look at that Ro', on my wrist

On some shit, make a call, ""Who is this?""

Think it's Benji on the line and he called, tried to flip

What I do? Make a call, call Papi for a brick

And papi call José, cause José got fish

Now I'm 30,000 feet up with my feet up, rollin' weed up

Pussy niggas couldn't bluff us, couldn't beat us

Throwing curveballs in the field get you hit like Derek Jeter

Double M, yeah that's the team, I know they see us, yeah



Wait a minute, wait a minute

Wait a minute, wait a minute

Wait a minute, wait a minute



I'm talking big, bitch, I'm talking big

We do it big, bitch, we do it big



Fuck a tutor, better get a shooter

Teach your ass a lesson when they running to ya

Fiends lining up like we having communions

This my daily bread and you niggas consumers

All I ever wanted was to make scrilla

Have a recording session with J Dilla

Selassie, Exodus

Corinthians, Leviticus

I'm on the books, I study well

Getting money, bitches know me well

Wake up in the world and I'm just another nigga

Call it public housing when you next door to the killers

On them corners it gets better as you go

Grind that motherfucker 'till it's yellow brick road

Free as a bird, spoken word in my verse

On my knees praying, niggas shooting in the church

Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat

I lived on Billboard, where the fuck to go next?

Go against the odds, youngin' go and get a job

Another country boy they want back on the farm

So far from my goals but I'm close to my kids

Get a bad bitch that posts up like comments

They don't know what I been through, don't know what I'm going through

As long as I get through that's what I look forward to

Richer than a bitch but still I can't afford to

Let these niggas play with me need to be remorseful

I swear I got that silencer on that Mac 9 and I kill these niggas with silence

My head stay in the clouds, I really feel like a giant

Can't trust none of these niggas, I murk one of these niggas

Then bury one of these niggas, still got dirt under my fingers, that

Ain't a threat that's fact cause they coming at my neck like the best a man can get

To make a long story short I need a shoulder because the devil on one

The other one I'm looking over

Ciroc in my cup, quick pic for a fan

Money over bitch, first nigga [?]

Cause them niggas getting raped

Go get the yellow tape, it's well orchestrated

200 acres estates, a young nigga made it

I'll never fall for what I stand for. This year Fernando. We could live today, blood, and die tonight, cuz





Box Chevy hit the block, run the whole 50 shots

You just poppin' 'til you know you can't pop 'em no more

We done came through the block and sold many color drops

And these mothafuckas think you can't drop 'em no more

All right, a nigga put some change on your head

Damn right, fuck around, clear my safe out

I got a few digi scales and a couple Denzels

And you mothafuckin' right, this a safe house

Give me the K and a shovel, I'll bury that nigga

Be his pallbearer, so I can carry that nigga

What you gonna hit him with, the Glock or the chop?

Look I wouldn't give a fuck if they were sharin' that nigga

You mothafuckas out here always talkin'

'Bout what another mothafucka said

Yeah I got that F&H when that mothafucka [?] hostin'

I ain't out here to mothafuckin' play

Why these fuck niggas always cryin' 'bout somethin'?

Either you're livin' like a ho or you're dyin' 'bout somethin'

Try to let that Rollie breathe but it's hidin' in my sleeve

Like that motherfucker timid or shy about somethin'

Tomorrow ain't promised, nigga roll up that weed

Gotta stay strapped to live the life I lead

Start your own alphabet with all them G's

Open up a hundred doors with all them keys

Yeah we live for them coupes but we dyin' by the gun

Missed his court date, now my nigga on the run

Big shit poppin' in his pocket like a lighter

Shit bag leave a grown nigga in a diaper

Hangin' out the Rolls, on your mark, get set

Let it go, yeah hold that bitch steady

When [?] get to wrestlin' and them drums get to bussin'

Yeah I hope you pussy niggas war ready

Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a nigga

Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga

Beamer on the Boulevard, everybody know it's me

Bordeaux Polo, smoke a ton of weed

No room for nonsense, you under new ownership

Pulling niggas' cards, giving shooters bonuses

Fuck the rumors, now I'm standing in a room with ya

Face, gut, buck 50, got two pistols

We the Knights of the Templar

Born dopeboy, oh, I should've been stopped

Def Jam see me as a threat now

Hundred mill, any less is a let down



This is it, boy

Stacking bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan

When my dogs getting high getting rich, haaaan

Snatch a nigga chain just to post it on the blog

Assassinate a name, nigga spraying in the dark

Hate you with a passion, but he asking for a job

Shame on a nigga that tried to run game on a nigga

Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga

Getting money while them other boys bitter

I'm an artist and my niggas are the realest

What a shame pussy niggas wear glitter

Put to sleep by the pillowcase killer

Black Benz, black weed, black bottle, nigga

I got eight car notes and just lost me a pack

On the beach, I'm up and down, women jockin' my ride

300 horses in this bitch, need a jockey inside

False floors for firearms is how you should ride

Tried to murder me while in mine so that's how I survived

My new deal with Def Jam just set me for life

Wanted to chapel the BM, man, I'm just rollin' the dice

Big numbers, I'm John Wall, I'm ballin' tonight

Just joking, my sense of humor is like one of a kind

MMde a killin' on Martin Luther James you're a shooter

Caught them slippin', gave them a pass throwin' pistols at survivin' gang

Next time boss gotta turn his back on 'em

Lettin' young boys *brrrrat* on 'em

Clean Maybach, but I'm filthy as shit

The partition is for the women, how busy we get

From the scotch, the large mop, bet the linking feel

It's all a dream and never wake me up until it's real

Duffle bags, that's for the homie when he comin' home

He never told and he never used the telephone

He on swole and that nigga need a telephone

In a Range Rover and a real nigga got it for him

Tell me it's real, I wanna know

How does it feel to be so real

I give her game and she give it back

All my dogs who used to sell Glocks

They say the niggas in the jail talk

How your homies commissary fell off, what make it worse he get an elbows

'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish

Great weed, nice homes, bread proper

Tech nine, one chamber, top shotta

Twenty stack seats at the Heat game

And I'm still strapped with the heat man

And we steppin' on a n*gga feet man

Cousin was a Crip, said it was a C thing

Brown bag money in a duffle bag

F*ck 'em all, wet 'em and we gotta double back

The homie whippin' chickens in his momma kitchen

On the mission, said he get it for his son tuition

Real n*gga's dreams comin' to fruition

Stumble, but I never fall, leanin' on my pistol

I'm just tryin' to be a billionaire

Come and suck a d*ck for a millionaire

N*ggas couldn't f*ck with my daughter's room

N*ggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks

Banksy b*tches, Basquiat

I ran through that buck fifty Live Nation fronted me

They workin' on another deal, they talkin' two hundred fifty

I'm holdin' out for three

Two seventy five and I just might agree

Ex-D-boy, used to park my beamer

Now look at me, I can park in my own arena

I only love her if her weave new

I'm still a hood n*gga, what you want me to do?

Been hoppin' out the BM with your BM

Takin' her places you can't go with your per diem

Screamin' carpe diem until I'm a dead poet

Robin Williams sh*t, I deserve a golden globe b*tch!

I take a Ace in the meanwhile

You ain't gotta keep this Khaled, it's just a freestyle

F*ck rap money, I've made more off crates

F*ck show money, I spent that on drapes

Close the curtains, f*ck boy, out my face

I whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case

Murder was the case that they gave me

I killed the Hermes store, somebody save me

Stuntin' to the max like wavy

Oh sh*t!

Oh, stuntin' to the max, I'm so wavy

Used to shop at TJ Maxx back in '83

I don't even know if it was open then

I ain't know Oprah then

Have the XL 80 bike

Loud motor, they be like, ""Damn!"" when I'm comin' through, rrraaanngg

Had the grill in '88, y'all n*ggas is late

You got all that, right?

I love this sh*t like my own daughter

Let's spray these n*ggas, baby, just like daddy taught ya

Young, this is just different"

Got on my darkest shades, this man is made
Inherit no riches, Jehovah's my witness
Physical fitness, home economics
In the kitchen digital scales producing the product
Cut the noose off my neck, black runaway slave

In the coupe with the tec, it's the home of the brave

They wanna know names, they toting on thangs

Never wanted the fame, just wanted the range

I needed some change, mama needed a raise

She stayed in a rage, hated minimum wage

I'm feeling the same, all these criminals paid

Wearing Bally's and gold, I'm selling dope shameless to say

And maybe one day I could put this pain away

Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

I'm ashamed to say

Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

(Honey, it's shameless

Shameless, what you've done)

Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

[Verse 2]

Before I was a fetus, had the genes of a leader

I mean look at my features, educated my teachers

I was calling them plays, you were still in the bleaches

Booby gave me the game, change to give me some sneakers

Now I'm roaming the block, car missing the top

Meaning missing a roof, hope you listening y'all

I was dealt a few blows, I felt a few lows

Even shed a few tears, I traveled that road

Went from walking on gravel, now I'm riding on vogues

50M's in the bank, I get me 200, I'm gone

Still so close to the hood, I'm ashamed to say

All the money in the world can't take this pain away

It's just another story at the campfire

Court side seats with the franchise

I think about my niggas doing 25

Shining bright, who am I for you to criticize?



[Hook x2]



[Verse 3]

I'm smoking psychedelics, I hustle like a felon

Hottest record label, but still in all I'm chilling

Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poise

First I stack some money, then go to war with them boys

Anybody can get it, hand his man some tissues

Better ring the alarm, cause we bringing them pistols

Heaven singing them songs, speaking on sensitive issues

These emotional niggas, and most of them killas

They moving in silence, but they follow your Twitters

These the games that they play, they study your Instagram pictures

See I live by the code, that the mafia wrote

When he ran his mouth, me I ran the smoke

I'd rather listen, he had the ?

I had to make a way, I had to act commission

Until this day am slanging, the commission remains

Now I'm worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say

Yea, such a breath of fresh air
Get a blow job, have a seizure on a Lear
Or get a new car, I could lease it for a year

Or bring it back tomorrow, that's a lease that disappear

Count new money, peeling out a venue

New Maybach after it was discontinued

Never question mine, my mind is so inventive

Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives

Maybach IV the allure that I adore

All money game, we got ones in the floor

See me on the wood, nigga, pause at the game

Two mil, the jewels, no flaws, ask them lames

Bow to the boss in the presence of a don

Started on the corner nigga, didn't have a coin

Playing my position for a club that I can join

Never in the draft, but that boy know he going

Throw me a bone, get me a brick

That's on the Quran I'mma go and get the chips

Go and get a rental, I got a cute bitch

She's showing some potential, so we taking trips

Nigga, assets last while memories fade

I'ma, [pass?] that ass I don't get paid

I'm a Mike Tyson type of, typewriter sniper

Double M life 'til a nigga pay the piper

I love when the beat dip

Same way I love to see a key flip

Go and pay your mama house off

Get sucked off, shorty wipe your mouth off

I'm alive, you could never write the South off

South paw, box a nigga off like a outlaw

Quick thinker, big better shut your mouth, wha?

Black chips, gold bottles ship it out raw

Pulling up slow, look at that boy

Young B.I.G., Lil Kim on tour

Lil Cease with me, all the cheese with me

All the g's with me, Maybach Eazy-E



[Interlude]

The good times don't last long

Just rewind the last song

We all shared some great times

As I read some great rhymes



[Ne-Yo]

What we does, is what dreams are made of

Come and get your love, all of this love



[Verse 2]

500 for the car that I got on the strip

That's another 100, what I got on my wrist

800 for the jar that I'm about to twist

It's a female strand, you know life's a bitch

As I get high, move my curtains to the side

Age like fine wine, ambitions they never die

Niggas get abused like boys at Penn State

Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate



[Ne-Yo]

Dreams, everything that we are

The life that we're living, baby it's ours

Dreams, money, homes, and cars

Baby that's a given, I'm talking about every fantasy

Be good real with me, still don't mean something, ooohhh, oh

Baby come with me and live the dream



[Outro]

It's a whole nother different element

It's Maybach roman numeral four

You couldn't fathom this, you couldn't imagine this

You can't produce this, you won't reproduce this



I'll be dreaming of you

I'll be dreaming of you

You'll be making it come true

I'll be dreaming of you

I'll be dreaming of you

I'll be dreaming of you

You'll be making it come true

When 16 ain't enough..
It's funny niggas, it's been on my mind lately
Having a dope beat, dope idea..
16 bars ain't enough!

How the fuck can I squeeze my whole life into a 16 bar verse?

You know, so many different levels, to living your life

Depicting with your wordplay, exactly what life means to you

16 ain't enough



I know y'all gonna feel me on this one

You gotta feel me on this one



[Verse 1: Ross]

It's funny how things change, funny how time fly

More than my feet travel, the more that I feel fly

More that I make now, the more that the chicks smile

She call me a local nigga, I opened a Swiss account

Eisenhower status Etta James on the dash

John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac

Seville - feel my life on the real

We the Last Poetss so this is a world premiere

Rolling like Mick Jagger, the women just getting badder

All I see is the money, cream, Eric Clapton

And all I wanted was one 16 ain't enough

Talking that fast money 15 every month

When your people labelled poor, that motivated me more

Everything I ever wore was once worn before

Roll with the punches now it's box office numbers

Dressed like Sammy Davis, steamin' my marijuana

Double MGs, double M fees

We in every hood, nigga: government cheese

Yachts and Yacht Masters, Old Dirty Bastard

Floor seat for the Heat paper that I'm stackin

Better put away a penny for the rainy days

Pick and roll, give and go, fuck a fade away

Livin' like Scottie Pippen, dribble riddles for vittles

Started off with a scribble, now I'm flowing a river

She say my heart cold I'm naming my son December

Whitney died night before the Grammys - damn, what a memory

Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed

Born broke had to use a nigga's instincts

Now I get a hundred racks for the 16

Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen

Niggas hating, I'm just watchin' on the big screen

3 stacks on the beat and the kicks mean



[Interlude: Andre 3k]

[You know how sometimes you got so much to say but

They on- they only give you 16, heh..

Man it's like.. I mean I got so much to say

The world has said so much to me, I just wanna give right back to her

But.. I only get 16, that's like a cage you know

I really can't say what I wanna say, you know it's just a glimpse

That's all, just one uh, one little single glimpse

Just a page

But I guess I'm defeating the purpose of doing all this talking



[Verse 2: Andre 3K]

Summer '88, or was it '89

Or was it winter-time, ah, nevermind

I'm in my room, boomin

Drawin LL Cool J album covers with crayolas on construction paper

I'm trying to fuck my neighbor, I'm tryna hook my waves up

I'm tryna pull my grades up, to get them saddle lace ups

Before Le marc was Jacob, before them girls wore makeup

Before my voice would break up, before we'd tour them shake clubs

Before my mama wake up, before my palms would cake up

Before they told me they love me and we'll never breakup

Before the time she makes love, to someone that I thought was, my homeboy

But boy, was I wrong, now

I don't budge, don't want much, just a roof and porch

And a Porsche, and a horse and unfor-tunately

But of course an assort-ment of tor-ches that scor-ches the skin, when they enter

Intru-ders, whose tutors did a lousy job

How's he god if he let's lucifer let loose on us

That noose on us won't loosen up but loose enough to juice us up

Make us think we do so much and do it big

Like they don't let us win, I can't pretend

But I admit it, it feel good when the hood pseudo-celebrate

Hence why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches

Then go grab the finest wine and drink it like we know which grape and which region it came from

As if we can name em, hint hint, it ain't um Welch's

Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler

Ya'll can't measure my worth

But when you try, you'll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods

Because the odds have always been stacked against me when back's against the wall

I feel right at home, y'all sitting right at home

All Kelly green with envy while I'm jelly beans descending

Into the palm of a child, looks up at mama and smiles

With such a devilish grin, Like ""where the hell have you been""

She yelling that selling's a sin, well so is telling young men

That selling is a sin, if you don't offer new ways to win

A dolphin gone shake his fin, regardless if he gets in

Or out of water, most important thing for him is to swim

And flipper didn't hold his nose, so why shall I hold my tongue?

(I miss the days that Ov and Market Hole had scowl on his arm?)

And I set off these alarms, when camera's snap snap snap snap

Return fire, pa-pa-pa, pa, pa-pa, pa, pa, pa

They'll learn why, near privacy, so essential

They won't make no laws, I break their laws till they see out our window

I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle

Forsake them all, I hate them all, don't like em don't pretend to

Yea something tells me, we ain't in Kansas anymore

All that shit that used to be cool ain't cool anymore

All the women you been pursuing, now they want more

And they deserve it all, don't settle for what ain't yours



[Breakdown]

Does your mama know you see me, does she know you're freaky?

Does she ever wonder if it's 'bout ya I am speaking?

Do you ever ponder where I'm at when you get sleepy?

How the hell I'm gonna tell the youth don't be me?

Yea



Does your daddy think you perfect, does he know for certain?

Does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains?

Do he think I'm 2Pac cause I'm black and put the works in?

Does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman?"

Bright lights and dark corners, it's night embark on us

Refugees running wild Wyclef with a Sig Sauer

Nothing to lose, I was starving from the start

Now the same cat drive in Jaguars

Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper

The club that I'm a member, they'll be gone by November

Keys to the city got killers who slither with me

Lamborghini, middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty

Billionaire bid, wrists on chill

Standing in the field of dreams tryna see a hundred mil

These boys going blind they just happy being free

In a world of so many I just wanted me a key

Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece

Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all decease

These boys snort lines I'm fine just sipping wine

Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind



[Hook]

I'm Barry Gordy to the streets

With a kilo ?

I wanna be there when each one of my kids born

Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on

Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased

Even then I pray I'm living through the beats

Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks

Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf



[Verse 2]

Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick

Always running late, quick to show up with your bitch

The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish

All stainless steel, quick to match it with my tool and

Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit

Red or blue, do you, as long as you're getting rich

Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange

Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change

These niggas acting like they want a war!

When it come to whacking niggas I done won awards

Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?

I'm riding in some shit only I can afford

Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a report

Amsterdam state of mind: I just gave you a tour

I'm laughing at the people who label me poor

Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn



[Hook]



[Outro]

I'm speaking on unwritten laws -- the code of the streets

I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him

And do what the fuck you want to do

Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie!

And that could take a long time!

In that time, I'mma handle my muthafuckin business..

Ruugh! Ruugh!



It's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam

Wherever the fuck I'm at

It's a no go

I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars

Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads

Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling

Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling

Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me gap

Lyor like how I move, want her right in my lap

Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit

Not a chance, whips got her talking foolish

We all dream of royalty

But that's who we are baby

All I ever need is girls and weed



Her shoe game remarkable

I feel solely responsible

I feel solely responsible

She fell in love with a dope boy
Black diamonds on the neck of that dope boy
Big by the Benz for that dope boy
Love every tattoo on that dope boy
She shares tears for that dope boy

Shit, it is what it is for that dope boy

Handle minor biz for that dope boy

But the reward is major, so on and so forth

She can tell you by the grayhound

She can show you how to stay down

I can tell you 'bout to break down

VS1's all in my bitch, watch face now?

Straight G's for your low esteem

8 P's for the whole team

As I run away from my obituary

Walking in the shit, that'll get you buried

Miami's mine like I'm Pat Riley

Baselines shoot at niggas, act wisely

Get the picture, niggas getting richer now

Living next to bitches, out on Fisher Isle

Down from Oprah, Don King, and Sosa

Come to the coca, calle de la boca

They let shit slide when my nigga won't

Remember God forgives and them triggers don't



[Hook: Omarion]

Aw baby it's just how it goes

Can't feel it but I know you know

Cause I keep it on the outside ?

Cause I keep it on the outside ?

And I reap just what I sew

My heart's beating but ?

And ya'll waiting on the inside ?

And ya'll waiting on the inside ?

?



[Verse 2]

She fell in love with the lifestyle

Paper tag now her life all iced out

Lear jets to the fights now

Belagio crap table with the dice out

Floor seats at the Heat game

Her bag 20 grand, nigga, peep game

South beach making love on the rooftop

Fucking to the rhythm, got her singing like she Jill Scott

I'm just a nigga with a attitude

Earning revenue through different avenues

One of my soldiers died in Attica

Anything other than a ride is out of character

Top down and it feels right

I could tell you what a dope boy feels like

I could tell you that he never sleeps

He may smile but it's never sweet

Swisha burning at his fingertips

Tears on the inside but they never drip

God forgives and the courts don't

Sneaking in a ? when the courts won't

Conversations on the phone until the break of dawn

Combination to her home, I gotta make her moan

Mean hustle got me chasing all this fast money

Well all the sneakers, now she touching cash money

So sexy in them all black and sepy heels

50 stacks in her bag so she know it's real

Top of the ferrari now we thugged out

Smoking on that callie bumping 2pac

It's me against the world now what's your phone number

Jumping in that range rover and I'm coming over

Bounce, love it how she always make it bounce

Rose petals on her bed, I walk in unannounced

I love it when she speak a different language

Pink champagne for my dame piece

In the sheets you know I flip her like a 9 piece

In the streets you know I'm eating like a lion feast

Lick a nipple tryna tickle all the finer things

Keys to the crib, keep it treal, time to handle bizz

Big dreamer, new beamer, just the realest

Cover of the source, owner of the Porsche

Killing all haters, showing no remorse

Knocking at the door, she recognize the voice

I'm not them other boys, she know I shine the most

She modeling a lot I know she on the go

Another bottle of siroc, baby let's have a toast

tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
And I ain't no connoisseur but I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
But before the sun graze ya
I'm tryin to see how deep you are

And believe me shorty I ain't talking about no intimate conversation

I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable

When I peek into your nature

And I promise you my goals well exceed any physical pleasure

I wanna, give you whats better than better

The better my effort, the wetter her treasure

The more these mere moments seem like heavens or temporary forevers

Shorty get it together

Diced pineapple

May your love come down so my mind might have you

You designed my imagination

Let me redefine foreplay so you need five and

Tell me shorty you got it baby

If its not it baby, hope its progress baby

Let it all drip baby

If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby, no more talking baby



Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh

Diced pineapples that my baby tastes the best

I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test

Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex

Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check

Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex

Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess

I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uhh

Sex all night couple shots of ciroc

Crib on the water got LeBron up the block

Money ain't the thing baby welcome to the Mark

Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar

Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sign her

Uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team

Double MG them other niggas fell off, baby girl I just wanna see you well off



Call me crazy shit at least you call me

Feels better when you let it out don't it girl

Know its easy to get caught up in the moment

When you say its cuz you mad then you take it all back

Then we fuck all night til things get right

Then we fuck all night til things get right



Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh

Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set

I know my lifestyle wild I just do it for the set

She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex

Pop bottles, make love, thug passion, red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion

Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated. Bal main rich denim, out Vegas

French Riviera baby girl lets take a trip

Im'a trip go to Cannes France to catch a flick

Baby listen, this position is a blessing and with your permission hopefully you'll learn a lesson

I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk. She so fine she ain't even gotta talk

Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar

She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star



Call me crazy shit at least you call me

Feels better when you let it out don't it girl

Know its easy to get caught up in the moment

When you say its cuz you mad then you take it all back

Then we fuck all night til things get right

Then we fuck all night til things get right



Something about her probably can't live without her

Roll up some sour, let me kiss on a fountain

Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate

And I won't ever rescue me the peak of your mountain

Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you

And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you

Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil

To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia

Hol' up, showing off some Asian provocateur

Rushing you out your draws

Though patiently get you off

Hate when they get too anxious though

Hate when they be too dull

Like too get too deep

But I hate to get too deeply involved

How sweet is you

Let me see some proof

Fuck making pussy talk

I like to make it sing a tune

All we need is weed

We don't need no room

Right now I'm trying eat

We don't need a spoon"

God forgives, He's so honorable
But living amongst thieves and niggas like myself
You will not have that luxury
[Verse 1: Rick Ross]

I wake up excited, I made it through the night

Things I did in the dark, will it ever see the light?

My nurse should be a wreck, I got a bad chick

She keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs

I think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fucking feature

I do at least three a week, roll up the fucking reefer

Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas

Ten chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer

Niggas claim that they thugging when they dick-riding

My niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbing

On the block in my all white sneakers

Lord knows that my ten Jesus pieces

Pray for me cause you know a nigga doing wrong

My homie in the cell, so I had to write a poem

Count mills for the times that we had it hard

Asking for a hundred mill as I pray to God



[Hook: Rick Ross]

I do this for my niggas facing hard times

Empty on them corners if you hustling part time

Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties

Rakim flows, coming from the far side

Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid

Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives

I pray for every soul that this music reaches

Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces



[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

Young nigga coming up, they wanna gun you down

Drinking vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn (I miss you Peanut)

Riding real slow on them all golds (we had them nigga)

Shopping for them Os when the mall close

Repping for your homies when they all gone

Get empowered then you put your dog on (Real shit)

All black tees, ten gold chains

At the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game

Ten years strong in the same trap

Ten years blowing on that strong pack

Lord knows that I wanna live right

But Lord knows what that Club Liv like (right)

Forty dollar tab meaning forty grand

Lord ? got it rolled up in a rubber band

Holding on the forty in his other hand

Ten chains on, smoking in the motherland



[Hook]



[Verse 3: Rick Ross]

I'm his poltergeist, niggas know I'm more than nice

All these jewels on, all ?

I could see it in the sparkle cause it lackluster

Black card maxed out, damn black brother

White collar, black minded

Chrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket

Eight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta

Screaming your affiliations, but that don't matter

I'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither

Never blackmail them, motherfucking killer

On trial and they wanna execute me

It's really sad, just the fact they never knew me

True G to the core, feel my texture

A true G keeps it raw in his lecture

Keep it simple, white tee, new sneakers

Dope boy style, ten Jesus pieces



[Hook]



[Verse 4: Stalley]

Versace shirt, Jesus laying on the chest

Man I swear Big did it the best, I mean

Nas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean

Ye did it fresh, but man Big did it the best

And I was so impressed that I went and got ten

Now I'm stunting on these niggas cause I couldn't back in

Rose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum

And I wear them all at once, I ain't trying to match them

I remember bumping Mac 10 and that deuce in the corner

Scraping up for a sandwich and a soda

Now my strength is up and I'm dangling chains off my shoulders

But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed

For the reason that I rhyme

And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine

Or even put it in a rhyme

It's better things I could talk about or put my money towards

But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss



[Hook]

It's time to take you to the other side
The side you gotta watch your A&E cable television for homie
But we live this shit
I'm not a star, well that's a lie
I seen a man raise his hand on the stand he testified

Spoke on a homicide amongst other things

Even share my triple beam dreams



[Verse 1: Nas]

A project minded individual, criminal tactics

Us black kids born with birth defects, we hyperactive

Mentally sex-crazed, dysfunctional they describe us

They liars, the end of the day, we fuckin survivors

I remember watching Scarface the first time

Look at that big house, that Porsche paid for by crime

How could I sell this poison to my people's in my mind?

They dumb and destroy themselves is how I rationalize

In a bastardized nation, magnum.45 carrying

Where I'm from ain't far from Washington Heights to cop Aryan

A rookie boy, the cookie didn't make no profit

A stranger to the block, I damn her had to make them cop it

It only took a fiend to taste it once to say it's garbage

I brought it back to papi, ain't trying to take no losses

He focuses on my emotionless young dealer face then pauses

He gives me powder, he has faith in Nas' ambitions to distribute coke

Had addictions to gold chains, Mercedes Benz hopes, but I'm again broke

This shit ain't cut for me, other dealers, they up their orders

Barely at 62s, they already up the quotas

Y'all out there every day, true hustlers for you

I'm at it half way, none of my customers are loyal

Picturing piping out the seats of a Pathfinder

Powerful pursuit for pussy, cash to flash diamonds

My junior high school class, wish I stayed there

Illegal entrepreneur, I got my grades there

Blaming society, mad, it wasn't made fair

I would be Ivy League if America played fair

Poor excuse, and so I was

Throwing rocks at the pen just for the love

Before the evil, the secret life of G's

You seeing my blurry, triple beam dreams



[Hook: Rick Ross]

Pocket full of money, parking lot full of them haters

Triple beam dreaming, crib with 2 elevators

20 flat screens and got cameras every angle

Dope been coming so you know the income major

Rule number 1: I can't do business with a stranger

Contract killers coming when I feel in danger

Early 90s reminiscing when I had a pager

Triple beam dreams: now Pat Riley my neighbor



[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

Fuck boy talking out of turn nigga

In the court room, spreading like a germ nigga

25 on the line, them niggas dropping dimes

Whole operation got them rednecks dropping time

Khaki suits and some niggas go to acting cute

We was all cool, stacking in Acura coupes

More accurately, we acted as is if jacking was cool

Snatching niggas out they shoes then wear jackets to school

Fuck boy you caught up in my dream

Countin cream on the cover of a magazine

I'm the source, got the plug with the uncut

Jay-Z Blue Magic nigga, what what

Brand new S Class with a meal ticket

Nigga cocaine white as Tommy Hilfiger

Ralph Lauren Blue Label as I'm gettin high

Triple deam dreamin as the cream multiples

Fuck boy talkin out of turn nigga

'Fore you sell dope, it's shit you gotta learn nigga

Home invasions, duct tape

Fornicating, counting money with a fuck face

Fucking bitches that be giving up your whereabouts

Slow leaks, gotta air em out

Kill em all, Rolls Royce, ghost nigga, ball

Phantom drop head, shit I had to get em all

Niggas hate but they know they never get involved

Food on the plate, fuck em all like a [?]

Triple beam dreams, the ghetto's my reality

I'm from where your hustle determines your salary

Six figure family member, nigga forget about it

Low income housing, nigga trying to get up out it

I got a plan little nigga, just believe in me

Triple beam dreamin with this thing in me

That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever

I remember being blind to it

'Til the day I put my mind to it

Pen and pad on the dresser for me to fine tune it

I sat in the corner, made up my mind, do it

Def Jam on my heels, should I sign to it?

Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent

Every day I'm hustlin' on every corner boomin'

Back of the phantom couldn't fathom I was such a student

Grandfather deal for the godfather

Lucian Grainge from the ghetto, I follow God's orders

And he told me I was rich forever

And he showed me I was rich forever

They call me Mr. Roberts when I'm in the bank

Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks

Flossin' out in Compton like I got a cape

RoseMo tried to fight it, but barely niggas fade

White sheet, yellow tape, where your dogs at

Count a million cash, can you blog that?

Me and my niggas your type never exchange numbers

Want to conversate and steal game from us

See the watch, now you want to know the name of it

Never playin' so I went and got the frame flooded

Cartier, Hublot, I could name a dozen

Your shit pushed back cause it ain't buzzin'

Now these thugs actors all of a sudden

Niggas hustle backwards all of a sudden

Can't talk snow, where the soft at

Your man got murked, but you squashed that

Hope you know what we call that

I think you know just what we call that

All you pussy boys fall back

Big face Rolly, Rolls Gold cost 40

Platinum twenty-one, it's time to go and spoil shorty

You only live once I'm screaming YOLO in the VI

Time flies fast balling with my nigga T.I

Ciroc, no glass, smiling women in my presence

Tall supermodels always fall in my possession

Atlanta housewives taking pictures in my section

But I only got a thing for young bitches with aggression

Show me that affection that a D-Boy craves

Rich forever in my D-Boy ways

Sold dope, blue jeans, new J's

Sold dope by any means all day

Got 100 women, gotta deal with it, love

Worth 40m's is he still dealing drugs

Cigarettes, speedboats, but he's still with the thugs

Club Liv, Louis shots on a Sunday

Grinding, even be legit one day

Order some more bottles because I'm on one

She wanna cum, maybe come over

G5s to 64s, Dre got 'em

Great weed, nice homes, bread proper

Tech nine, one chamber, top shotta

Bentley coupe, new yacht, my helicopter

Born broke, real n*gga straight out of Compton

The f*ck you magazine n*ggas want from me?

I rewrote the game, n*gga, now talk money

All black on my Al Capone sh*t

I came a long way from the weed game

Twenty stack seats at the Heat game

And I'm still strapped with the heat man

And we steppin' on a n*gga feet man

80 pair of sneakers came from the D game

Cousin was a Crip, said it was a C thing

Brown bag money in a duffle bag

F*ck 'em all, wet 'em and we gotta double back

The homie whippin' chickens in his momma kitchen

On the mission, said he get it for his son tuition

Real n*gga's dreams comin' to fruition

Stumble, but I never fall, leanin' on my pistol

I'm just tryin' to be a billionaire

Come and suck a d*ck for a millionaire

Play this sh*t while you play around with my crown

They workin' on another deal, they talkin' two hundred fifty

I'm holdin' out for three

Two seventy five and I just might agree

Ex-D-boy, used to park my beamer

Now look at me, I can park in my own arena

I only love her if her weave new

I'm still a hood n*gga, what you want me to do?

Been hoppin' out the BM with your BM

Takin' her places you can't go with your per diem

Screamin' carpe diem until I'm a dead poet

Robin Williams sh*t, I deserve a golden globe b*tch!

I take a Ace in the meanwhile

You ain't gotta keep this Khaled, it's just a freestyle

F*ck rap money, I've made more off crates

F*ck show money, I spent that on drapes

Close the curtains, f*ck boy, out my face

I whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case

Murder was the case that they gave me

I killed the Hermes store, somebody save me

Stuntin' to the max like wavy

Oh sh*t!

Oh, stuntin' to the max, I'm so wavy

Used to shop at TJ Maxx back in '83

I don't even know if it was open then

I ain't know Oprah then

Have the XL 80 bike

Loud motor, they be like, ""Damn!"" when I'm comin' through, rrraaanngg

Had the grill in '88, y'all n*ggas is late

Got on my darkest shades, this man is made
Inherit no riches, Jehovah's my witness
Physical fitness, home economics
In the kitchen digital scales producing the product
Cut the noose off my neck, black runaway slave

In the coupe with the tec, it's the home of the brave

They wanna know names, they toting on thangs

Never wanted the fame, just wanted the range

I needed some change, mama needed a raise

She stayed in a rage, hated minimum wage

I'm feeling the same, all these criminals paid

Wearing Bally's and gold, I'm selling dope shameless to say

And maybe one day I could put this pain away

Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

I'm ashamed to say

Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say



[Hook x2]

(Honey, it's shameless

Shameless, what you've done)

Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say



[Verse 2]

Before I was a fetus, had the genes of a leader

I mean look at my features, educated my teachers

I was calling them plays, you were still in the bleaches

Booby gave me the game, change to give me some sneakers

Now I'm roaming the block, car missing the top

Meaning missing a roof, hope you listening y'all

I was dealt a few blows, I felt a few lows

Even shed a few tears, I traveled that road

Went from walking on gravel, now I'm riding on vogues

50M's in the bank, I get me 200, I'm gone

Still so close to the hood, I'm ashamed to say

All the money in the world can't take this pain away

It's just another story at the campfire

Court side seats with the franchise

I think about my niggas doing 25

Shining bright, who am I for you to criticize?



[Hook x2]



[Verse 3]

I'm smoking psychedelics, I hustle like a felon

Hottest record label, but still in all I'm chilling

Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poise

First I stack some money, then go to war with them boys

Anybody can get it, hand his man some tissues

Better ring the alarm, cause we bringing them pistols

Heaven singing them songs, speaking on sensitive issues

These emotional niggas, and most of them killas

They moving in silence, but they follow your Twitters

These the games that they play, they study your Instagram pictures

See I live by the code, that the mafia wrote

When he ran his mouth, me I ran the smoke

I'd rather listen, he had the ?

I had to make a way, I had to act commission

Until this day am slanging, the commission remains

Now I'm worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say

[Verse 1]
Yea, such a breath of fresh air
Get a blow job, have a seizure on a Lear
Or get a new car, I could lease it for a year

Or bring it back tomorrow, that's a lease that disappear

Count new money, peeling out a venue

New Maybach after it was discontinued

Never question mine, my mind is so inventive

Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives

Maybach IV the allure that I adore

All money game, we got ones in the floor

See me on the wood, nigga, pause at the game

Two mil, the jewels, no flaws, ask them lames

Bow to the boss in the presence of a don

Started on the corner nigga, didn't have a coin

Playing my position for a club that I can join

Never in the draft, but that boy know he going

Throw me a bone, get me a brick

That's on the Quran I'mma go and get the chips

Go and get a rental, I got a cute bitch

She's showing some potential, so we taking trips

Nigga, assets last while memories fade

I'ma, [pass?] that ass I don't get paid

I'm a Mike Tyson type of, typewriter sniper

Double M life 'til a nigga pay the piper

I love when the beat dip

Same way I love to see a key flip

Go and pay your mama house off

Get sucked off, shorty wipe your mouth off

I'm alive, you could never write the South off

South paw, box a nigga off like a outlaw

Quick thinker, big better shut your mouth, wha?

Black chips, gold bottles ship it out raw

Pulling up slow, look at that boy

Young B.I.G., Lil Kim on tour

Lil Cease with me, all the cheese with me

All the g's with me, Maybach Eazy-E



[Interlude]

The good times don't last long

Just rewind the last song

We all shared some great times

As I read some great rhymes



[Ne-Yo]

What we does, is what dreams are made of

Come and get your love, all of this love



[Verse 2]

500 for the car that I got on the strip

That's another 100, what I got on my wrist

800 for the jar that I'm about to twist

It's a female strand, you know life's a bitch

As I get high, move my curtains to the side

Age like fine wine, ambitions they never die

Niggas get abused like boys at Penn State

Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate



[Ne-Yo]

Dreams, everything that we are

The life that we're living, baby it's ours

Dreams, money, homes, and cars

Baby that's a given, I'm talking about every fantasy

Be good real with me, still don't mean something, ooohhh, oh

Baby come with me and live the dream



[Outro]

It's a whole nother different element

It's Maybach roman numeral four

You couldn't fathom this, you couldn't imagine this

You can't produce this, you won't reproduce this



I'll be dreaming of you

I'll be dreaming of you

You'll be making it come true

I'll be dreaming of you

I'll be dreaming of you

I'll be dreaming of you

You'll be making it come true

I'll be dreaming of you

When 16 ain't enough..
It's funny niggas, it's been on my mind lately
Having a dope beat, dope idea..
16 bars ain't enough!

How the fuck can I squeeze my whole life into a 16 bar verse?

You know, so many different levels, to living your life

Depicting with your wordplay, exactly what life means to you

16 ain't enough



I know y'all gonna feel me on this one

You gotta feel me on this one



[Verse 1: Ross]

It's funny how things change, funny how time fly

More than my feet travel, the more that I feel fly

More that I make now, the more that the chicks smile

She call me a local nigga, I opened a Swiss account

Eisenhower status Etta James on the dash

John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac

Seville - feel my life on the real

We the Last Poetss so this is a world premiere

Rolling like Mick Jagger, the women just getting badder

All I see is the money, cream, Eric Clapton

And all I wanted was one 16 ain't enough

Talking that fast money 15 every month

When your people labelled poor, that motivated me more

Everything I ever wore was once worn before

Roll with the punches now it's box office numbers

Dressed like Sammy Davis, steamin' my marijuana

Double MGs, double M fees

We in every hood, nigga: government cheese

Yachts and Yacht Masters, Old Dirty Bastard

Floor seat for the Heat paper that I'm stackin

Better put away a penny for the rainy days

Pick and roll, give and go, fuck a fade away

Livin' like Scottie Pippen, dribble riddles for vittles

Started off with a scribble, now I'm flowing a river

She say my heart cold I'm naming my son December

Whitney died night before the Grammys - damn, what a memory

Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed

Born broke had to use a nigga's instincts

Now I get a hundred racks for the 16

Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen

Niggas hating, I'm just watchin' on the big screen

3 stacks on the beat and the kicks mean



[Interlude: Andre 3k]

[You know how sometimes you got so much to say but

They on- they only give you 16, heh..

Man it's like.. I mean I got so much to say

The world has said so much to me, I just wanna give right back to her

But.. I only get 16, that's like a cage you know

I really can't say what I wanna say, you know it's just a glimpse

That's all, just one uh, one little single glimpse

Just a page

But I guess I'm defeating the purpose of doing all this talking



[Verse 2: Andre 3K]

Summer '88, or was it '89

Or was it winter-time, ah, nevermind

I'm in my room, boomin

Drawin LL Cool J album covers with crayolas on construction paper

I'm trying to fuck my neighbor, I'm tryna hook my waves up

I'm tryna pull my grades up, to get them saddle lace ups

Before Le marc was Jacob, before them girls wore makeup

Before my voice would break up, before we'd tour them shake clubs

Before my mama wake up, before my palms would cake up

Before they told me they love me and we'll never breakup

Before the time she makes love, to someone that I thought was, my homeboy

But boy, was I wrong, now

I don't budge, don't want much, just a roof and porch

And a Porsche, and a horse and unfor-tunately

But of course an assort-ment of tor-ches that scor-ches the skin, when they enter

Intru-ders, whose tutors did a lousy job

How's he god if he let's lucifer let loose on us

That noose on us won't loosen up but loose enough to juice us up

Make us think we do so much and do it big

Like they don't let us win, I can't pretend

But I admit it, it feel good when the hood pseudo-celebrate

Hence why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches

Then go grab the finest wine and drink it like we know which grape and which region it came from

As if we can name em, hint hint, it ain't um Welch's

Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler

Ya'll can't measure my worth

But when you try, you'll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods

Because the odds have always been stacked against me when back's against the wall

I feel right at home, y'all sitting right at home

All Kelly green with envy while I'm jelly beans descending

Into the palm of a child, looks up at mama and smiles

With such a devilish grin, Like ""where the hell have you been""

She yelling that selling's a sin, well so is telling young men

That selling is a sin, if you don't offer new ways to win

A dolphin gone shake his fin, regardless if he gets in

Or out of water, most important thing for him is to swim

And flipper didn't hold his nose, so why shall I hold my tongue?

(I miss the days that Ov and Market Hole had scowl on his arm?)

And I set off these alarms, when camera's snap snap snap snap

Return fire, pa-pa-pa, pa, pa-pa, pa, pa, pa

They'll learn why, near privacy, so essential

They won't make no laws, I break their laws till they see out our window

I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle

Forsake them all, I hate them all, don't like em don't pretend to

Yea something tells me, we ain't in Kansas anymore

All that shit that used to be cool ain't cool anymore

All the women you been pursuing, now they want more

And they deserve it all, don't settle for what ain't yours



[Breakdown]

Does your mama know you see me, does she know you're freaky?

Does she ever wonder if it's 'bout ya I am speaking?

Do you ever ponder where I'm at when you get sleepy?

How the hell I'm gonna tell the youth don't be me?

Yea



Does your daddy think you perfect, does he know for certain?

Does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains?

Do he think I'm 2Pac cause I'm black and put the works in?

Does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman?"

We get ghost, you already know what it is
Money stuffed in my bag

Bright lights and dark corners, it's night embark on us

Refugees running wild Wyclef with a Sig Sauer

Nothing to lose, I was starving from the start

Now the same cat drive in Jaguars

Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper

The club that I'm a member, they'll be gone by November

Keys to the city got killers who slither with me

Lamborghini, middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty

Billionaire bid, wrists on chill

Standing in the field of dreams tryna see a hundred mil

These boys going blind they just happy being free

In a world of so many I just wanted me a key

Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece

Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all decease

These boys snort lines I'm fine just sipping wine

Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind



[Hook]

I'm Barry Gordy to the streets

With a kilo ?

I wanna be there when each one of my kids born

Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on

Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased

Even then I pray I'm living through the beats

Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks

Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf



[Verse 2]

Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick

Always running late, quick to show up with your bitch

The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish

All stainless steel, quick to match it with my tool and

Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit

Red or blue, do you, as long as you're getting rich

Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange

Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change

These niggas acting like they want a war!

When it come to whacking niggas I done won awards

Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?

I'm riding in some shit only I can afford

Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a report

Amsterdam state of mind: I just gave you a tour

I'm laughing at the people who label me poor

Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn



[Hook]



[Outro]

I'm speaking on unwritten laws -- the code of the streets

I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him

And do what the fuck you want to do

Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie!

And that could take a long time!

In that time, I'mma handle my muthafuckin business..

Ruugh! Ruugh!



It's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam

Wherever the fuck I'm at

It's a no go

I call up my slime, I need a kilo tonight

Everything whipped well, I'm eatin' steak, no more soup

Then I parked the Caprice, I went and bought me a coupe

Fornicate in my fortress, 40k still my mortgage

24k my toilet, all my taxes reported

All my exes deported, shout-out Texas, New Orleans

All these niggas influenced by a hustler's endurance

I just bought me the purest, but I need some insurance

Niggas breakin' the rules, niggas facin' suspension

Momma workin' three jobs 'til I told her to quit

How we rose from the sewers, funny now I'm the shit

Niggas ain't gettin' money, but they got an opinion

Had this tech makin' racket, serve you like you were tennis

Killers ride for that paycheck, AK okay, check

Bitch nigga let's play chess, yo bitch next, no latex

Whip 'em right and then come right back

Whip-whip-whip 'em right and then come right back

I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars

Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads

Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling

Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling

Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me gap

Lyor like how I move, want her right in my lap

I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek

I ain't missing nothing, got her sipping something

Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship

I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip

Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch

Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit

Not a chance, whips got her talking foolish

I was skipping the classes, but I got me a master

I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest

Fishscale made me major profit margins

I never been in love until I heard a beat

She never met a G until she heard of me

Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do

And ya'll waiting on the inside ?

And ya'll waiting on the inside ?

?



[Verse 2]

She fell in love with the lifestyle

Paper tag now her life all iced out

Lear jets to the fights now

Belagio crap table with the dice out

Floor seats at the Heat game

Her bag 20 grand, nigga, peep game

South beach making love on the rooftop

Fucking to the rhythm, got her singing like she Jill Scott

I'm just a nigga with a attitude

Earning revenue through different avenues

One of my soldiers died in Attica

Anything other than a ride is out of character

Top down and it feels right

I could tell you what a dope boy feels like

I could tell you that he never sleeps

He may smile but it's never sweet

Swisha burning at his fingertips

Tears on the inside but they never drip

God forgives and the courts don't

Sneaking in a ? when the courts won't

Right now, is about that time

Touch'n you, touch'n you

Let me show you something  baby

You say it's on, seeing is believing,

Turn the lights on

Rick Ross

She kissing on me, biting on my bottom lip

In the gallery all I get is buy me this

Conversations on the phone until the break of dawn

Combination to her home, I gotta make her moan

Mean hustle got me chasing all this fast money

Well all the sneakers, now she touching cash money

So sexy in them all black and sepy heels

50 stacks in her bag so she know it's real

Top of the ferrari now we thugged out

Smoking on that callie bumping 2pac

It's me against the world now what's your phone number

Jumping in that range rover and I'm coming over

Been thinking bout you all day

Touch'n you, touch'n you

Still can't get my mind off your body

I'm day dreaming bout you sure turn me on baby

And every time you let me

Nobody compare to your body, yeah

Touch'n you, touch'n you



Rick Ross

I think I wanna put a ring on it

I think I wanna tat her name on me

I had a lot of sexy women, but this is not the same for me

Bounce, love it how she always make it bounce

Rose petals on her bed, I walk in unannounced

I love it when she speak a different language

I touch her in so many different 

Born stunna and my baby so stunnin

Wanna, but she find them so funny

I'm getting money, living like the most wanted

She all I ever needed, now I think I

Rick Ross

Pink champagne for my dame piece

In the sheets you know I flip her like a 9 piece

In the streets you know I'm eating like a lion feast

Lick a nipple tryna tickle all the finer things

Keys to the crib, keep it treal, time to handle bizz

Big dreamer, new beamer, just the realest

Cover of the source, owner of the Porsche

Killing all haters, showing no remorse

Knocking at the door, she recognize the voice

I'm not them other boys, she know I shine the most

She modeling a lot I know she on the go

Another bottle of siroc, baby let's have a toast



Usher

Touch'n you, touch'n you

Been thinking bout you all day

tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
And I ain't no connoisseur but I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
But before the sun graze ya
I'm tryin to see how deep you are

And believe me shorty I ain't talking about no intimate conversation

I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable

When I peek into your nature

And I promise you my goals well exceed any physical pleasure

I wanna, give you whats better than better

The better my effort, the wetter her treasure

The more these mere moments seem like heavens or temporary forevers

Shorty get it together

Diced pineapple

May your love come down so my mind might have you

You designed my imagination

Let me redefine foreplay so you need five and

Tell me shorty you got it baby

If its not it baby, hope its progress baby

Let it all drip baby

If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby, no more talking baby



Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh

Diced pineapples that my baby tastes the best

I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test

Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex

Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check

Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex

Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess

I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uhh

Sex all night couple shots of ciroc

Crib on the water got LeBron up the block

Money ain't the thing baby welcome to the Mark

Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar

Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sign her

Uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team

Double MG them other niggas fell off, baby girl I just wanna see you well off



Call me crazy shit at least you call me

Feels better when you let it out don't it girl

Know its easy to get caught up in the moment

When you say its cuz you mad then you take it all back

Then we fuck all night til things get right

Then we fuck all night til things get right



Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh

Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set

I know my lifestyle wild I just do it for the set

She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex

Pop bottles, make love, thug passion, red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion

Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated. Bal main rich denim, out Vegas

French Riviera baby girl lets take a trip

Im'a trip go to Cannes France to catch a flick

Baby listen, this position is a blessing and with your permission hopefully you'll learn a lesson

I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk. She so fine she ain't even gotta talk

Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar

She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star



Call me crazy shit at least you call me

Feels better when you let it out don't it girl

Know its easy to get caught up in the moment

When you say its cuz you mad then you take it all back

Then we fuck all night til things get right

Then we fuck all night til things get right



Something about her probably can't live without her

Roll up some sour, let me kiss on a fountain

Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate

And I won't ever rescue me the peak of your mountain

Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you

And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you

Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil

To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia

Hol' up, showing off some Asian provocateur

Rushing you out your draws

Though patiently get you off

Hate when they get too anxious though

Hate when they be too dull

Like too get too deep

But I hate to get too deeply involved

How sweet is you

Let me see some proof

Fuck making pussy talk

I like to make it sing a tune

All we need is weed

We don't need no room

Right now I'm trying eat

We don't need a spoon"

God forgives, He's so honorable
But living amongst thieves and niggas like myself
You will not have that luxury
[Verse 1: Rick Ross]

I wake up excited, I made it through the night

Things I did in the dark, will it ever see the light?

My nurse should be a wreck, I got a bad chick

She keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs

I think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fucking feature

I do at least three a week, roll up the fucking reefer

Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas

Ten chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer

Niggas claim that they thugging when they dick-riding

My niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbing

On the block in my all white sneakers

Lord knows that my ten Jesus pieces

Pray for me cause you know a nigga doing wrong

My homie in the cell, so I had to write a poem

Count mills for the times that we had it hard

Asking for a hundred mill as I pray to God



[Hook: Rick Ross]

I do this for my niggas facing hard times

Empty on them corners if you hustling part time

Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties

Rakim flows, coming from the far side

Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid

Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives

I pray for every soul that this music reaches

Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces



[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

Young nigga coming up, they wanna gun you down

Drinking vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn (I miss you Peanut)

Riding real slow on them all golds (we had them nigga)

Shopping for them Os when the mall close

Repping for your homies when they all gone

Get empowered then you put your dog on (Real shit)

All black tees, ten gold chains

At the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game

Ten years strong in the same trap

Ten years blowing on that strong pack

Lord knows that I wanna live right

But Lord knows what that Club Liv like (right)

Forty dollar tab meaning forty grand

Lord ? got it rolled up in a rubber band

Holding on the forty in his other hand

Ten chains on, smoking in the motherland



[Hook]



[Verse 3: Rick Ross]

I'm his poltergeist, niggas know I'm more than nice

All these jewels on, all ?

I could see it in the sparkle cause it lackluster

Black card maxed out, damn black brother

White collar, black minded

Chrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket

Eight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta

Screaming your affiliations, but that don't matter

I'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither

Never blackmail them, motherfucking killer

On trial and they wanna execute me

It's really sad, just the fact they never knew me

True G to the core, feel my texture

A true G keeps it raw in his lecture

Keep it simple, white tee, new sneakers

Dope boy style, ten Jesus pieces



[Hook]



[Verse 4: Stalley]

Versace shirt, Jesus laying on the chest

Man I swear Big did it the best, I mean

Nas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean

Ye did it fresh, but man Big did it the best

And I was so impressed that I went and got ten

Now I'm stunting on these niggas cause I couldn't back in

Rose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum

And I wear them all at once, I ain't trying to match them

I remember bumping Mac 10 and that deuce in the corner

Scraping up for a sandwich and a soda

Now my strength is up and I'm dangling chains off my shoulders

But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed

For the reason that I rhyme

And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine

Or even put it in a rhyme

It's better things I could talk about or put my money towards

But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss



[Hook]

We untouchable

I'm not a star, somebody lied, I got a pistol in the car, a 45
If I'd die today, remember me like john lennon
Bury the louis, I'm talkin all brown linen
Make all of my bitches tattoo my logo on they titty
Put a statue of a nigga in the middle of the city

Load up the choppers like it's december thirty first

Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts

Told em my partnah and help them faggots give em thirty

I told em I got it, therefore I gotta do ya dirty

Back on my benz, been in these bitches 830

Scoot me a dime, now man get off at 1030

Goin on 12, go home and tell that man I'm lyin'

I got a bake sale, bitches stunnin for the pie

9 for the slice, dummy that's a dan marino

Talkin quarterbacks mean ya talkin quarter kilos

Niggas feel my pain, I aint even gotta say it

Where I come from if they be hopin thatcha payin

How I can save when all my niggas in the can

And by my brothers people, motherfucker take my hand



Pull up to the club I got a kilo in the car

Black card for the niggas spending c-notes at the bar

I'm not a star [x4]



All black Lamborghini, smokin on the sticky

Got a couple dollars, now this nigga think he ricky



Pull up to the club I got a kilo in the car

I'm not a star [x4]



I'm not a star, somebody lied, I spent a milly on the car

It come alive, never feed it after dark, gotta treat it like gremlin

It's a multi-million dollar motherfucker in it

And I'm quick to blow a milli in a minute

I know them people wanna stick me with the senates

I'm a player catchin bitches like I'm TO

Trunk full of work, yea this nigga think he neno

Three dice yea, grab a nigga for a kilo

Pink ring a hundred grand but keep that on the d-low

Diddy negotiates and the paperwork the TO

My niggas never sing if I need em I go to neo

Fuck a famous bitch then I treat her just like a ski-oh

Not even worth a shower, just grab me a stick of deo

Monday for monages and tuesday I get a trio

And the bitch that get a gift on the scriff, she was a PO



Pull up to the club I got a kilo in the car

This is for the soldiers the see the sun
At midnight, ya dig
Let me slow down (it's so incredible)

[Rick Ross Verse]

I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga

Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas

We the lost symbols, speak in cryptic codes

Ancient wisdom, valuable like gifts of gold

I embark on life, my path is all math

I understand the codes these hackers can't crack

I understand that folks expect me to fold

Community control to violate parole

I won't fail, but a lot of men will

I'm iconic in the field, like Solomon's Seal

Uh, it's just an intro

Allow my flow time to sink into the temple

Free Mason, freelancer, free agents, we faster

Big contracts, big contractors

Built pyramids, period we masters

No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas

A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors

All white mansion, I'm the child of God

All black diamonds, times were hard

New Rolls Royce

Guess you made it, nigga

All white neighborhoods, you they favorite nigga

My top back like J.F.K.

They wanna push my top back like J.F.K.

So, so I J.F.K.

Join Forces with the kings and we ate all day

Right now I could rewrite history

I stopped writin so fuck it, I'll do it mentally



[Rick Ross & John Legend Chorus (x2)]

I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga

Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas

Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide

Multiplying and I pray to God we never die



[Jay-Z Verse]

Niggas couldn't do nothing with me they put the devil on me

I would have preferred if niggas would squeeze the metal on me

Rumors of Lucifer, I don't know who to trust

Whole world want my demise, turn my music up

Here me clearly

If y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me

Fuck all these fairy tales, go to hell this is God engineering

This is a Hail Mary pass, y'all interfering

He without sin shall cast the first stone

So y'all check in the mirror, double check your appearance

Bitch I said I was amazing

Not that I'm a Mason

It's amazing that I made it through the maze that I was in

Lord forgive me I never would've made it without sin

Holy Water, my face in the basin

Diamonds in my rosary shows he forgave him

Bitch I'm red hot, I'm on my third six but the devil, I'm not

My Jesus piece flooded but thou shall not covet

Keep your eyes off my cupboard

I'm a bad motherfucker, it's Hov just say you love it



[Chorus]



If I ever die, never let it be said I didn't win

Never, never say

Never say Legend didn't go in (Imma go in)

I just wanna die on top of the world

Makin' love to my favorite girl

Makin' beautiful music, we makin' a movie

We knew we was born to do it"

Smokin' a fat spliff in a brand new Benz
No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin
Looking in the mirror but I don't see much

Still running the streets so I don't sleep much

Watching the snakes so they don't creep up, but the way

I'm gettin this money niggas can't keep up, you niggas can't keep up

Niggas got beef but it can't be much

I'm still walking through the crowds like I can't be touched

Top back all black Gretzky puck

Ice skater lil' later might let me fuck, damn she might let me fuck

Last night I cried tears of joy

What did I do to deserve this?

Vacheron on my wrist a year ago

I didn't even know the bitch exist

Quarter milli for the mothafucka

No insurance on the mothafucka

Ain't life a bitch, but you gotta keep her wet

Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set

Everybody know that I'm a lotta people's threat

Biggie Smalls in the flesh livin' life after my death

Yesterday I read my horoscope

Tell me Lord will I be poor and broke

Tell me Lord will I be dealing dope

I wanna take my momma to the Poconos, but only the Lord knows



To all the loved ones I leave behind

At least they can't see me cry

And I ask, when someone wants to be me why

Thought having everything would ease my mind

If you could read my mind

My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy



Last night I cried tears of joy

What did I do to deserve this?

Young rich motherfucker still uneducated

But dammit a nigga made it, goddamn a nigga made it

Crib bigger than a church, Lord know I'm blessed

Five different lawyers, Lord know I'm stressed

A punch in the face get you 300K, ask Vlad

Now he back to making minimum wage, another victim of my criminal ways

I wanna walk in the image of Christ

But that bitch Vivica nice

And I'm still swimming in ice

I'm just living my life, I'm just living my life

Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate

Life is just a pussy race

Snatch a bitch take her back to your place

Next morning I can tell you how the pussy taste, I got expensive taste



To all the loved ones I leave behind

At least they can't see me cry

And I ask, when someone wants to be me why

Thought having everything would ease my mind

If you could read my mind

My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy



Last night I cried tears of joy

What did we do to deserve this?

Not to dwell on the the past but to keep it real

I gotta represent for Emmett Till, all the dead souls in the field

Lookin at my Rollie it's about that time

White man had a problem with mine

And we suppose to be shy?

The revolutions televised, Bobby still on the rise



To all the loved ones I leave behind

At least they can't see me cry

And I ask, when someone wants to be me why

Thought having everything would ease my mind

If you could read my mind

My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy"

My garage is flawless, under a hundred thou' ain't allowed

Maybach triple white like I'm riding in a cloud

No denim on my seats, baby you gon' need a towel

Ride sexy through the city, see me you will be aroused

My bankroll so well endowed, pull bitches from M-I-A to A-T-L in style

And in crowds catch me in town, on the strip in Vegas

chilling, filling bitches' faces with babies

Bitch bite your tongue, this just ain't a Mercedes

Tell the A.T.F. I'm riding with another .380

That's my car cost, y'all thought I would fall off

That was just a small loss, we can have a ball off

Fly to N.Y., meet me at the Waldorf

The story and architecture Victorian

Riding in the past like you're driving a DeLorean

Hard times, never heard of those in the 'Bach

My feet kicked up, get my dick sucked with the curtains closed

And for the record kid, my final question is

how your bitch gon' feel in that when you two pull up next to this?

Hahahahah, Maybach Music nigga!

Yo, piff that I'm blowing on is fucking up the ozone

Plus I keep a dope line similar to Cold Stone's

Ice cream, pipe dreams

is what they have when I pull up in that light thing

I put a hurting on, I got the curtains drawn

Whoever ain't getting shitted on, I'm squirting on

I'm in the six-deuce, fifty-sevens for the health

Chopper in the trunk, .45 for the belt

Bunch of wax dummies, all you guys gonna melt

Live for your kids, die for yourself

Bottles in the sky if you ride for the wealth

Peas on the block, pies on the shelf

If I ain't in the back of the 'Bach, I ain't in nothing else

Haha, I'm something else

Uh, cigar please

I came alive like a moth in the summer time

Japanese wheel blades all samurai

Shine brighter than them bitches on the other side

Time to make a blind motherfucker recognize

Ammunition got the competition nonexistent

Had to bubble crack but didn't have a pot to piss it

I'll double that, how dare you try to knock a nigga?

Street scholar, graduated no father figure

Still tote chrome, check my chromosomes

Meet me halfway with things and a mobile home

Money machines, yeah they RING like a mobile phone

I'm a seven-up, I need a coca-cola loan

I'm in the hood like I'm James Evans

Cashmere hand-made sweater

Me and money got a vendetta

MAYBACH MUSIC.. COLOR CUT CLARIY



My gun dirty, my brick clean

Im ridding dirty, my dick clean

She talk dirty but her mouth clean

Bitch I'm MC hammer.. I'm about cream

I got 30 cars, hole lot of dancers

I take them everywhere.. I'm MC Hammer

Started selling dough, I'm too legit to quit

When its hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick



Im at the car lot, I'm going broke

I pay for 5, they find a couple more

I take them home, like I do my hoes

I dress them up, I buy them clothes

Glass slippers, I gas's hoes

Now she's acting brand new on you assholes

Limousines, I did that, two door coops boy I live that

My top back, I'm circumcised

I pull it back, just to go inside

She thinking folic, I'm thinking wings stop

Feening lemon pepper, I got my thing cocked

Black bat mobile, its only new Ferrari

Its called scaglietti one button like a Atari

Im just advising, my profit is rising

Niggas buying stocks any nigga like a verizon



My gun dirty, my brick clean

Im ridding dirty, my dick clean

She talk dirty but her mouth clean

Bitch I'm MC hammer.. I'm about cream

I got 30 cars, hole lot of dancers

I take them everywhere.. I'm MC Hammer

Started selling dough, I'm too legit to quit

When its hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick



I got the porche, I was so ecstatic

100 grand a day my operation is so elaborate

Credit card sqeems, that was for the faggots

Mother fuck window shopping boy I gotta have it

Now my shit be booming all across the atlas

Puchi puchi money long now we call him alex

Hade to move from daisy cuz that shit went local

Pick up the mansion and I sat that bitch back down in bocal

My badest bitch is latin but they call me loco

Till I fuck them in the ass out in Acapulco

Im thinkin money every moment thinkin money

I bust a nut then I'm back to thinkin money

My wrist froze my mind blow I'm off slow my eyes closed

You gotta judge a man by his principles

Teflon don, I am invincible



My gun dirty, my brick clean

Im ridding dirty, my dick clean

She talk dirty but her mouth clean

Bitch I'm MC Hammer.. I'm about cream

I got 30 cars, hole lot of dancers

I take them everywhere.. I'm MC Hammer

Started selling dough, I'm too legit to quit

When its hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick"

Let's pull the 2-seater out baby
It's where ever you wanna go!
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride

Just me and my boss, no worries at all

Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music



Would've came back for you

I just needed time to do what I had to do

Caught in the life I can't it let it go

Whether that's right I will never know

But here goes nothing



When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall

Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?

My down, bitch, one who live by the code

Put this music shit aside get it in on the road

A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose

Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold

Following fundamentals and following in the rental

I love a nasty girl whose swallow is on the menu

That money triple up when ya get it out of state

I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space

Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space

In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take



Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night

Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride

Just me and my boss, no worries at all

Listening to the, Aston Martin Music, Music



Would've came back for you

I just needed time to do what I had to do

Caught in the life I can't it let it go

Whether that's right I will never know

But here goes nothing



Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box

Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch

Living fast where it's all about that money bag

Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back

Top down right here is where she wanna be

As my goals unfold right in front of me

Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me

Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me

That thing keep calling

Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!

Pink bottles keep coming

James Bond coupe pop clutch 100



Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night

Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride

Just me and my boss, no worries at all

Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music



Would've came back for you

I just needed time, to do what I had to do

Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know

Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong

Tried to be patient, waited too long

But I would've came back, but I would've came back

Would've came back, would've came back

Would've came -



I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta

Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what's up witcha?

I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it

I took some sense and made a nickel of it

I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers

With those lips that all that lipstick covers

You're never too grown up to miss and hug her

And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers

I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers

This ain't the life that I'm used to

Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to

Did you forget me?

Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me

And fear that I won't remember

I wish you could still accept me for me

I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad

The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have

I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags

Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd

In one nigga, amazing shit

I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit

I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit

And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit

Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?

The seats for these Heat games?

I really think you stare at yourself and you see things

La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed

To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit

Fuck is up?

Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices

23 and goin' through a midlife crisis

But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife

And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it

Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach

To be far from hood, but to understand the streets

I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech

Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach

Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it

Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment

And, baby, I'll never forget none of that

Girl, I told you I was coming back

You know Get Money?
Becoming the young Chamillionaire.
Good sight of the things that is important to him.
OLYMPICKS

I'd never trade my old girl for all the money in the world.

I'd never trade my daughter Toya for all the money in the world.

I'd never trade my only boy for all the money in the world.

I put my last name first!

I can hear my Daddy saying, ?Lil' nigga go get 'em!?

Passed in '99 cancer all up in his liver.

Shit- difference is now (his?) son's a lil richer.

I'd never rap again if I could tell him that I miss him.

Why the fuck I own the world when I can't share it with him?

Bust his ass, so I just want to break bread with him.

Crying in my mansion as I'm holdin on his picture.

It's a golden moment world, I'm flyin' solo on you niggas.

Being the only boy = definition of a man.

All the money is the world still not a big enough as his.

Still all the money in the world still not big enough as his.

For me to turn my back on me being the man that I am.

Turn off the lights (Turn on the lights),

Take a ride with me. (Take a ride with me.)

I wanna see you smile (I wanna see you smile),

It's a fantasy (It's a fantasy).

La La LaLa Laa (La La LaLa Laa),

La La LaLa (La La LaLa)

La La LaLa Laa (La La LaLa Laa),

La La LaLa (La La LaLa)

Momma gettin older feelin pains in her shoulder.

I gotta stay focused and remain a little soldier.

Brace a few wishfuls and the streets begin the whisper.

Praying for you niggas still stocking up my pistols.

Lil nigga getting murdered and buried in all white.

8th grade school you all thinking it's alright.

Trying to figure out where I'm going with my life.

As I'm stepping on the brake and hangin' a sharp right.

Did my thing in the streets, seen in the streets see me at the park on the swing with my niece.

Watch chipped up, still won't switch up.

First damn thing, and so you gotta turn that bitch up.

Turn off the lights (Turn on the lights),

Take a ride with me. (Take a ride with me.)

I wanna see you smile (I wanna see you smile),

Oh Man- When I close my eyes I can see you about a million times.

Its true over and over (over and over).

Yea- I did it again, it kinda makes me laugh cause you're the one that put me on this map.

I guess I gotta keep moving strong.

I feel like I can't go wrong.

(Because I can hear you talking with me.

I can hear you talking to me.

I know you hear them saying LaLa La La Laa -

La La LaLa Laa (La La LaLa Laa),

Come and take a ride with me.

I really wanna take a walk wit' you.

It'd be cool to have a drink with you, think with you... take a ride with meee.

There's so much to say, old memories wont go away...go away... go away... go away...

(yea yea yea yea)

Old memories won't go away not never never like it was yesterday...

that time never felt so good, never forget about you never never would.

Old memories won't go away not never never like it was yesterday...

that time never felt so good, never forget about you never never would.

Old memories won't go away not never never like it was yesterday...

that time never felt so good, never forget about you never never would.

Say you never never would (Say you never would).

Just can't forget about you, No No no no.

You know I never would and I never could and don't think that I can never ever could and don't think I can..

Look up at da stars, she like ""Honey where da roof?""
Pull up in a Dawes ?, canaries ? dey go on roof,
Even once had a job pourin tar up on da roof.
Dat boy had it hard, no facade it's da truth,
So now when I menage and get massaged it's da proof.

Proof's in da pudding and dat bakin soda taken,

Paper dat I'm makin, gotta take dem photos naked.

Listenin to niggas like whistlin dat Wendy Williams,

I flip my middle finga, I'm chillin on twenty million.

Da rumors turn me on I'm masterbatin at da top,

These hoes so excited so dey catchin every drop.

I'm dodgin debacles like pot holes in Jamaica,

We cut down the weed, bury the paper on dem acres.

Martin had a dream, Bob got high,

I still do both but somehow I got by.



Preflo prayed, Mike Vick payed,

Bobby Brown strayed, Whitney lost weight.

Kimbo Slice on da pad when I write,

Dat may why the money lookin funny in the light.

But who really cares? You just throw it in the air,

Celebratin wealth, pourin Mo«t in her hair-

Excuse me, her weeve- the bluest of weed,

Trunk full of white, car smell like bleu cheese.

Dat boy get salad ?, beef bout movements,

BM dubs on dem big thangs lookin foolish.

Shawty sittin low, big thangs poppin,

Tip on da glock from a trip up in Compton.

Shootin at da cops- fuck one time.

I gave her to da block, I fucked one time.

We boys in da hood and nigga you Lil' Trey,

Suppress ya appetite, we takin ya lil' tray.

Love my handgun but my choppa still da shit,

Banned in 1994 but I'm too legit to quit.

1996, kilos was the shit,

But dat were better den roofin dat shit be bad for ya skin.

Niggas was ruthless, lord knows dat I sinned,

But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin.

Walked out on a gig and I turned to da streets,

Kept my name low key, I ain't heard from in weeks.

I came up with a strategy to come up mathematically,

I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me.

Mothafuck em all, they sweat from my balls,

If I drop anotha album I did dat fo my dawgs.

10 Maybachs, everybody ridin big,

I just sit back like: Look what I did.

Den I bow my head and beg for forgiveness,

Once I said my prayer, everybody back to business.



Smokin on a blunt in my own restaurant,

People lookin from a distance think I'm Big Daddy Kunk,

Reincarnated, spirit of a G.

Beef? I'll make you dinner, take a seat so we could eat.

A Farrakhan aura, paws on the Port,

You eat from da bowl while ya dog need a fork.

Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered in dey coil,

I'm laughin at you cuz, kill you niggas when I'm bored.



We steppin on ya crew til the mothafuckas crushed,

And makin sweet love to every women dat ya lust.

I love to pay her bills, can't wait to pay her rent,

Curtis Jackson baby mama ain't askin for a cent.

Burn the house down, we gotta buy another,

Don't forget the gas can, jealous, stupid muthafucka.

To anotha chapter, paper dat I captured,

Caught up in da rapture of gunshots and laughter.

Homicide is human and nigga you lookin funny,

Women love to stare cause dey know dey see da money.

I open up a mind by openin bank accounts,

Deposit a 100 stacks, break up or take it out.

Baby dats a gift, maybe you could live,

I knew it wouldn't work, but I just like to give.

Used to run da street- young nigga, bare feet,

Now I'm in da suites and I'm eatin crab meats.

Ice so right, otha rappers envy,

Dey callin all my jewelers up askin wat he spendin.

Thinkin bout Boss, not thinkin bout dem,

This a letter to my enemies, one I won't send."

It's Da Boss.
It gets no better than this...



Maybach Music!



[Chorus - John Legend:]

Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin',

Gold Emblem with 2 M's in it, this living is so magnificent, stop dreaming it, I'm living it

(Oh I), I can show you, show you better that I can tell you, I can show you, Oh I



[Verse 1 - Rick Ross:]

I'm tha magnificient with tha sensational style, far from bein' shallow cause she caught me wit a smile,

try to figure out my style, baby that will take a minute but if all we got is time,

you can't be actin' timid, so we back to playin tennis, we been goin' back and forth,

she the one that I adore, so I tried it in aurar,

conscience intervened concentrating on my cream, I'm tha king, make a move, pawns all tha way to queens,

I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a g, I'm a CEO which means that I profit off of me (Yea!).

All white T's still rockin' my Nike Airs, fresh outta flight school, cause I'm fly right? (Yea!)

Ain't nothin free, I'm chargin'to breathe air, if it's not a Maybach, really who da hell cares?

My money long, my nigga my money strong, if you ain't gettin' money dat mean you done somethin' wrong (Boss!)



[Chorus]



[Verse 2 - Rick Ross:]

I'm tha magnificient with tha sensational style,

down to all of my automobiles wit no miles, yellow corvettes, black rally stripes, and I never phone ahead,

all she do is hear the pipes, project bitches, upscale kittens, fuck her for a minute then now we countin' digits,

Maybach money so I always had a vision, I would always tell ma niggas but... ain't nobody listened.

Words work magic, haters wreak havoc, there ain't nothin'on my back but the delicates of fabrics.

I made a transition from the thieves, to the biggest executive Def Jam's ever seen.

Only yours dream, Sean John suit and a S. Dot ring, Sean Don for my crew, bad hoes in pursuit,

Masspike on a two, Gunplay he a glue goon wit a attitude (Holla!)



[Chorus]



[Verse 3 - Rick Ross:]

I'm tha magnificient with tha sensational style, when I decorate a home, marble flooring like Da Nile,

nigga you a clown, here's the number you should dial, ye start wit 305 but we end at 4 pounds.

Stop at ... old pound, for life is a ??, all them Carol City killers, feel liking you broke down,

money is a must tommy guns on a bus, Allan Zamren on the case, so you know what you can suck,

wear red all the time but really I'm colour blind, wanna catch my attention nigga, throw up a dollar sign.

One time for tha Crips, young g's buyin cribs and I smoke wit Vice Lords when I visit Mississip.

The game never change, money still a focal, but its time to rape tha game like Puffy did Total,

like Rev Run in the tub still smokin', in memory of Shakir, Boss gotta shout Oakland!

And still my talent is yet to be challenged,

Had new jet with my own pilot,

No blastin off, but flexin, Dj Khaled,

My mom stressin college,

But my crude sense of logic, did a lude to my empty wallet,

Try spittiin on a green tinted accord,

Which could mean a sentence up north,

Where the homie was, but back then doe was like a hoard, it goldie love, it didn't exist,

And office foley cuffs, was after my wrists,

Was not beverly hills where we chilled,

Imagine this, the nas n rith,

Had to get from rags to rich,

I used to stand on rooftops, with 2 glocks,

Figurin, how do I turn my timbalands to clocks,

Now reptiles was left out about a watch,

What is you thinkin? Murk u, plus the muscle that you bringin is nothin to me,

If you thuggin, a fake and shaked on cuban,

Shout out my ricans,

Down with all of you gangstas, to the roughest jamiacans.

Doin a 150 miles and runnin,

Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin,

Throwin money cause I can and I love it,

[Rick Ross:]

If you ballin physics, nigga money never flow,

Meanin every day I'm livin, tryna stay on flow,

Coming from a BOSS, I can predict a double cross,

Handlers managin money, they never come across.

I spend in Africa, Magnamers, numbers involved,

AK47s, Singin win or by sum or you fall?

I dealt with brawls, and those willin to sell they soul,

Over cars and clothes, man am talkin petty hoes,

Ask ma feddi grow,

Fuck a feet of spaghetti-o's.

I'm club poppin in cali shout out to ariel,

Somebody dim the lights,

Triple black tuts,

Caz associated and the flesh is tryna catch up,

I roam with niggas who destined to get a life sentence,

Get they baby mama a lexus for them nice visits,

Ma nigga got a dub an love to do the push ups,

I got a million cash, tryna get the kush up.

Guns in the attic, mama help me put 'em up

She'll put'em down, tell you quick to hit'em up

Load a hundred round, bring it back, she'll fill it up

Be sure you got a rider beside you to hold you down

I'll hold you down, I'm on my way
My mama told me (you are) be sure you got a rider beside you
Even if you ain't have all the money, fame and the power

So I found her, fly shit, I jump up out her

I pick her low valley, she rock with me, it don't matter



There goes my baby

Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air

Hold this ready and I'm round

You hold me down, I'mma hold you down

(Now)



I'mma get money, nigga, smell it on my gear

Black bottle, boy, baller hood billionaire

Boots in the mud, now it's marble floors

Staircases to the roof look like it's heaven's door

Said a prayer for my woes who be dead and gone

How could I let you down if you never hit the phone?

Then they gave him all his money, make you go insane

We fucked the game, she said she knew that I would never change

Trap star, two bricks in the match box

Gold D's, fat boy, peanut butter top

I wanna spend a night with Jessica White

But is a dope boy really Jessica type?

Hold this ready and I'm round

You hold me down, I'mma hold you down

I'm on my way (We the best yeah, we the best at holding it down) to hold you down



She said he don't hold her down right

Some day she'll be done with him

I say there's 7 days in the week, some day ain't one of 'em

You gotta know your work, baby, don't give 'em no discount

All of mine are dime, you see a nine, it was a miscount

And I'm the one to tell a bitch to bounce

I'm the one who getting this amount

I'm the one with this foreign shit

Name still getting mispronounced

Hold up, who you held down? When you ever put bail down?

I'mma keep picking money up like the motherfucker fell down

It's an us versus y'all thing, we a small gang

Just the two of us, baby, but we all bang

Bang, bang bang like what set you claim

And when they asked me that baby, you know I said your name



There goes my baby

Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air

Hold this ready and I'm round

You hold me down, I'mma hold you down

(Now)



I'm on my way (To hold you down)



Keys to the whip, key to the mansion

I fuck you while counting money, I'm just that romantic

See we be Bonnie and Clyde and I keep that heat like Adonis

And if it ever go down I know you won't snitch to your honor

That's why you draped in designer, Chanel and all kind of shit

She with the realest and all 'em lames are too counterfeit

It's been a long time and she's still holding me down

Never mind the hoes I've been fucking with that's out of town (let's ride)

I done been through hell, had ups and downs

But in the long run she's still here

I apologize for when I be talking that freak shit in the air

She still moaning, I know you want it, I go to switching that gear

On everything, she never changed for real

That's why



There goes my baby

Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race



I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress



I'm the leading man

And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate

I'm the leading man

And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate



I wrote the gospel on giving up (and looking pretty sinking)

But the real bombshells have already sunk (primadonnas of the gutter)

At night we're painting your trash gold, while you sleep

Crashing not like hips or cars but more like p-p-p-parties



This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race



Bandwagon's full, please catch another



I'm the leading man

And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate

I'm the leading man

And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate



All the boys who the dancefloor didn't love, and all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough, sing, until your lungs give out



This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

Put her on the payroll 'cause flat out she get's down

And her mouth get wet as a bottle of Crystal

Niggas lookin at me, pa but I'm packin a pistol

Fuck kicked out, bitch I'm tearin this shit down

Watch that dick standin up, girl it's hard to get down

Cause it's just another day in the life of the goddamn boss



[Rick Ross]

I don't make love, baby we make magic

Come home with a thug, let's get shit crackin

Always wear a (plastic), baby cause shit happens

She leaked the back seat, just a freak and a Magnum

Hopped out the Magnum, hopped in the Tre'

Just to let the top back and thank God for the day (hey!)

Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say?

I made a couple million dollars last year dealin weight (geah)

Still in the streets, strapped with them thangs

She in love with the G, so she tatted my name (Ross!)

I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far

Ten black Maybachs back to back in a lane

I'ma make it rain (rain), and I'ma make it back (back)

You are just a lame lil' homie, that's a fact

Workin wit the police, actin like you know me

Fresh out of jail, already in yo' ho cheeks

Cause it's just another day in the life of the goddamn boss



[Rick Ross]

I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far (Ross!)

Got the biggest cars, Spanish broads, no bra

Bottle after bottle and I'm sure you'll count 'em all

Then we off to that Chevy - (Fired up!) and takin off

Baby, slow it down cause you movin too fast

Ass too fine to be movin too fast (hol' up!)

Back to the thuggin, now I'm sippin sizzurp

All my niggaz love it, baby that's my wizzerd

Stack for the jeans, five {?} for the shizzerts

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]

Every dollar that I count can't grow in my account,

My account can't count up all my money in an hour,

'Cause it's comin too fast and I'm scared it won't last,

Look that white girl in her face,

Told her this was her last dance, goddamn (damn),

Speed got my heart racin',

See I don't have the nominations,

You can blame it on my occupation,

Caesar salad, Caesar's Palace,

You not a boss lil' nigga cause your cheese is average,

In the Benz AK ridin' shotgun,

It's a Benz cause your broke 'till you got one,

It ain't nothing do a 100 in the maybach,

Throwin' money out the roof muthafuckin' brake pads.



[Chorus: R. Kelly]

Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs,

See people came lookin' for me shit I got ghosts,

Read between the lines or yo' ass like Fantasia,

Get hit between the eyes he died they can't save him,

I'm a mosh I'm weavin', no no but I'm Speedin',

Staring at the skyline I got a million on my mind (I'm the best),

See these pussy niggas running out of time (Ricky Ross),

I'm the chill quarter mill for the time piece,

Yeah I bought a wheels like deals for the dime beats



[Chorus: R. Kelly]



[Verse 3: R. Kelly]

Sittin' in the living room watching the Grammy's,

Wishing that was me that was on the Grammy's,

All I needed was someone to get behind me (money rain on me),

I was a determined hill nigga, dirty shoes of hillfiger,

Homie help me out cause this boy's a drug dealer,

Nap time cause my gift grew wings,

And now I'm flying down like the cool crew winds,

Kells and Ross on the Hollywood scene,

Red carpet and it's smellin' like green,

Now foss cause I got paid off Calabra was the hit poppin' on R&B boss



[Chorus: R. Kelly]

With the house on the water hit the beach whenever

She's from the north and still can't believe there whether Boss

And you can tell him I said it

He was talking a lot at first,

But you can see that dead it

You can see I ain't sweat it,

Hell I'll even call him my self

And tell him I dead it naw

Please don't confuse me miss

I'm tryina see if I could put you

On my Christmas list

I hope you ain't offended by this

But I think your xxx fine as xxxx and

That's straight up real talk, all bullshit

Aside she replied

""I Like To Do The Wild Thang""

Action took place at my place

Now my place is her place



[Chorus:]

I got a bunch of dollars

I can spend them on her

Cause she can be my lady,

She can be my lover

Call me on the late night,

Get right he ain't acting right

Every super woman needs a super man

Here I am



[Verse 3:]

Mo better mo cheddar not the man

Off your clothes last sweater (what)

Hoe getter gorilla xxxx chuffers,

I rock with Niggas like Fabolous cause

He tell the truth baby like Fabolous

But you make it look glamorous

Here's spaghetti strapped heals not for amateurs

Risk quite rocky, talk like foxy, job like roxy,

Spark that broccoli walk quite aky

Let me sexy I will save you if you let me.

Fly with me, get high as me

[Chorus:]

I got a bunch of dollars

I can spend them on her

Cause she can be my lady,

She can be my lover

Call me on the late night,

Get right he ain't acting right

What is this? (Maybach music)
I like this Maybach music

[Both Girls:]

Sweeeeeeeeeeet!

Ha-ha-ha!



[Sample:]

Come and take a ride

Come and take a ride



[Rick Ross:]

Billionaire

Yayo

JUSTICE LEAGUE



[Rick Ross:]

57 years, yes!

Blood for a D-Boy

Hand my mack 11 to the engineer to record

Got the baddest women in the world for me to feed on

Double deck yacht, docked Boss, blowing weed up

Revenue incredible, it put me on a pedestal

Columbia to Mexico, I figure there was a better rule

Look at me, a model now

Models and bottles 'round

A Blood holla', ballin'

But the boys in blue, shot 'em down

Gang-affiliated, colors prosecutors painted

'Cause the niggas I employed, name synonymous with Mi-Yayo

Instrumental that are mental, Maybach kind of mental

400 off the lot, the block is monumental

Some things money can't buy

Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride

In the rear, so many instruments I hear

Tucked behind curtain, no signs to fear (ROSS!)

I'm higher than a leer / Aaliyah

This Maybach music, designer shit I wear

May cause you to lose it

Close your eyes and inhale the smoke

It's Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote, nigga!

5 ounces, take a toke

Of this Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote

BOSS!



[Jay-Z:]

YOUNG!

Fuck it then!



[Jay-Z:]

Black Maybach, white seas, black piping

Remind me of Paul McCartney and Mike fighting

You know, ""The Girl Is Mine""

""Life's A Bitch"", so ""The Whole World Is Mine""

The six-deuce long, the curtains are drawn

Perfectly like a Picasso, Rembrandts and Rocco's

I'm a major player, 40-40's in Vegas at the Palazzo

They said it was not so

Certain things that money can't buy

Like being this fly

'Til then, I'm just gonna' ride!

I'm like G-Rap with better transportation

On the road to the riches, reach my ""Final Destination""

And the lair, closer to a leer / Aaliyah

Say a ""Prayer"", hope I get ta' see her

When I disappear from here - baby, yeah!

But I don't see the ending through these millionaire lenses

Just the Two M's on the emblem

The partition roof, translucent and Humador

Where refrigerators, where Ace of Spades - two I store!

True story, my closet is like two stories

Cut to the happy ending, 'cause I don't do stories

Shawn Corey, real rap

The Maybach is bananas, peel back!

You feel that?

YOUNG! C'mon!



[Jay-Z:]

Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach

8-track episodes, been doing this since way back

Since way back, since way back

8-track episodes, been doing this since way back!

Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach

8-track episodes, been doing this since way back

Since way back, since way back

8-track episodes, been doing this since way back!



[Rick Ross:]

BOSS!

Can't be stopped now

We got too much cake



[Rick Ross:]

They pinching pennies, while I'm muscling for meals

And the muscle be that muzzle, when I stuff it in your grill

Stuffed shells - thanks to crack, I crack

Crab and lobsters, not all mobsters

Imposters - got cha!

Boy, I got an eagle view, slanted on my balcony

Can only stay a week or two, so many people out for me

I bulletproofed the Maybach

Got a killer's intuition

Holding on that mack 11, Makaveli premonition

Waiting on my Suge Knight

One nation under God, since I chose a thug's life

Guess I gotta' play my part

Never will I die, my name symbolize

The hustle for young killers coming from the other side

Some things your money can't buy

Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride

I'm large, my black car

Menagin' black broads, massage for frauds

I'm livin' large, sellin' fat rocks

In the ""Killin' Field"" of hip-hop

Runnin' up on the car, you get popped, mopped and dropped!

I'm The Boss!"

[Verse 1:]

Niggas want to kidnap (kidnap), leave me in the trunk, walk away with big stacks (big stacks)

They jealous of the fortune, the glitz and the fame my cocaine mortgage,

In the game like tony parker, snow white range and my partner pocket,

I'm back on them thangs that's my only problem, homie I put that only mamma.

Still rollin' with the 4 5th now that I'm rich got these broke niggas so sick,

And my daughters college pre paid, she straight - say thanks to the d game!, in that phantom on that tupac, ridin' through the ghetto like I'm lookin' for a new spot, nawwt. but I'm well established, I f**k with heroin cause it sells the fastest.



[Chorus:]

I'm a ride bout mine, and I wouldn't tell a lie,

Take it out of town go and get my money right.

And if it ain't bout cash, I don't really care

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

If it ain't 'bout cash I don't really care,

[Verse 2:]

Uh, boss

A bitch try to stick me,

Just cause you f**k me don't mean you can kiss me,

Naww

On the run [? ] nigga four keys

I.d.'s, passports it was so sweet (they lookin' baby!)

Front yard still a carshow, blue gotti, the gotti and my rocko

I won't let the roof up, kingdom come, prince is a?

To be loved, to be loved, oh what a feeling for me to be loved

Haters want to murder me and I can smell a hit,

So it's music to my ears everytime I feel a clip,

I'm a card shark up in a hard rock, 20 grand a hand baby jam in the ipod?



[Chorus:]

I'm a ride 'bout mine, and I wouldn't tell a lie,

Take it out of town go and get my money right.

And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

If it ain't 'bout cash I don't really care,

I'm straight 'bout cash,

I'm a hood billionaire.



[Verse 3:]

Boss

Hit a hundred grand in a day damn

Whip that white girl just like k-fed

Got me a white girl, I f**k til her face red,

Yeah her food tastes bad, but she givin great head,

Please let me say that, I really love a fat ass

Take her to the dealer ship, and shecan she can get that

My heart in the ghetto, I'm married to the projects

I ride with AR, incase a nigga start shit



[Chorus:]

I'm a ride bout mine, and I wouldn't tell a lie,

Take it out of town go and get my money right.

I think we got a problem
Yeahh...

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Big money in this bitch if you didn't knew.

Big business minus the business suit.

Even I look in the mirror like is it you,

And I say I must be the hottest if it isnt you.

Stay fresh from my top to my tennis shoes.

New coop, no top, big tennis shoes.

Never slipped, not even on the side of a swimming pool.

We don't get rid of Q,

We get rid of fools.

They said I couldn't play football I was too small.

Yhey say I could'ntplay basketball I wasn't tall.

They say I could'ntplay baseball at all.

And now everyday of my life I ball.

And they say it ain't raining until someone assassinate,

And I feel like MLK

Yeah... I have a dream to be your worst nightmare,

And now meet the boss of the cartel.



[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

I'm a seven-nine satan, sitting on Lorenzzes.

And I seem really patient, picture the equation.

People taking pictures and they really getting fragrant.

Flags down my spaceship, sergeant searching for a fragrance.

Yayo, Yayo, he wanna sniff the yayo, flying saucer on the hasa

In the casa just to lay-low.

Make more (money man) that the model for the mob,

Need a blowjob my model, get a model for the job.

Go hard, no job, hustler, no prob, poster,

Nigga what finger fuck you whole squad.

Forty around spending doe, flipping for my kin 'fo

Let you raid tax on them packs if you didn't know

Bought a new crib, niggas feeling like I hid.

3.2 but I just did it for the kids.

More guns than a pawn shop,

Got my whole arm rocked.

Keep the 760 double parked in the wrong spot.



Still huustling...

BOSSS



[Chorus: Lil Wayne]

Yeah... You gotta pay for this,

I remember when I used to pray for this.

This, this is classic,

So this shit you might never see again.

And we taxin, you don't want it nigga leave it then,

And we taxin, you don't want it nigga leave it then.

And we ain't trying to see the pen,

Like a needle in a hay stack we ain't trying to see the pen.

This is a luxury tax.



[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]

(I don't ask them baby I just tax em baby)

(Let's go)

Yeah imagine this,

No imagine that.

Gave me my sack like, goodluck getting back.

(Yeah...)

I'm like how the fuck I'm gonna get outta there.

And if I'm not careful,

Leave em the same place they find him there.

And I'm a winner if I make it cross the finshline,

Putting food on the table like it's dinner time.

And this is what you call sterotyping about?

Can you tell me my your dog keep sniffing my car?

Huh? Got the audacity to call me a liar.

So what you got in your trunk?

Oh, just a spare tire.

You niggas talked blow,

While I sold mine.

Like a bad crape, it's locking up in no time.

More time in the kitchen then I spent in the studio,

Case paradise and I ain't talking about Coolio.

Can't lie, still addicted to the odor

Got a ice cold Pepsi,

But still thinking Coke-Cola.



Hahaha...



[Chorus: Lil Wayne]



[Verse 4: Trick Daddy]

I'm up early in the morning, and I'm dressed in black.

Hold on, every morning I get dressed in black.

While your half ass looking at my pants sagging,

I'm getting money, and my swaging and black flagging.

Million dollor status, fully automatic.

Heavy on the? and even harder on the women.

If it wasn't for reverend,

I probably would pimpin and shit.

Pops, my papai, has already hear me.

Tied trapping, shit sent me to prison,

Got mad and went to savage so homocide came to visit.

I smell gun powder,

So you got one hour to come up with every damn dollar,

Or your dun-dolla.

It cost a ball dogg,

Especially when the players on your team,

Consider you as the ball hog.

You treat me like Shaq,

And you Kobe but I didn't say you owe me nigga.

But act like you know me nigga.

Hundred thousand in jewels

Standin in his bloody boots 

Yea I'm fresh outta boot camp

Ain't gotta food stamp 

Counterfeit bills will get you killed 

Now where the goons at

It's poppin in Opalocka, floppin dem candy paints 

Chrome Daytons, 12 pack of 12s in the seven trey 

Still hustle everyday, Dade County be the place 

Get murdered for a burger with a nickle-plated burner

But I fuck her like I love her Boss...

Rep my city every night

Just to see my daddy wavin' at a football game

Just to see my daddy standin' when they say my name

Walk me to the locker room and say, ""Son, good game! "" (For real!)

You make a tackle, but nobody there to clap

Made me think back, when I was baggin' up a bong

Young D-Boys always bragging about the run

I was on my third Rolley - now, I guess we're the bomb!

Now it's deep cuts in the club for the watch

Might let two dimes just f**k while I'll watch!

If you ever cross that line

And we all for that paper

Comin' from a life of crime

Tryna be on my best behavior

You see my rep's gettin' bigger but still that same nigga bustin' shots at them haters

But only if you cross that line

(Hold up, Hold up)



[Verse 1: Rick Ross]

I was birthed in the crackhouse

But what made it worse every first is a ??

Little brother knowin' life illegal

No toys just playin' wit pipes and needles

I'm gon' find knights and regals

$5000 on the paint just so life will see ya

Green cards for the free lunch

Now his green cards scream larger than seats crush

Big guns for the other side

Nigga try me I'ma teach his momma homicide

I wanna see his momma eyes

I done cried 20 years now I'm runnin' dry

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

When I'm low on funds, I'ma load up guns

Slap ya in the head I'ma open one

African in bed, she just hope I'm done

See the voodoo priest then the coke gon' come

Open up a drum, I'm eatin' Oprah crumbs

Got poor credit, got whore debit

Walk in the 40-40 I'ma score, bet it

Four tennis chains hoe, I'm progetic

But the 4 pellets will getcha prosthetics

If you don't get it, just don't let it

A life setence is a life sentence

All my homies got 'em, they just like business

The last minute of your last breath

I'm the last entrance right before your last step

[chorus:]
All I need is bakin soda some pots and pans
Little ice up what i can
Chick at home sayin I'm no good

Fuck that I'm gettin out the hood



[Verse 1:]

What started as a nickel rock

Took 22 months now I'm tryna get a block

Fuck football I'm goin down another path

Couldn't past the test

To tell the truht I couldn't fuck with math

I did get a shcolarship but I blew that

Got high, got a ticket and I flew back

To the hell zone most straps stand 20 shell toes

Get life on yo cell phone

Quarter key box of soda Ross whip that

Career criminal fa' sho' Ross with that

Had to pull my pants up 

Boy get them brands up

Daddy got some cancer I never had the chance to

Tell him all my plans to let em' fuck a danca

Smokin weed and AmsterDam with his grandson

(Damn) Why he passed on me(on me) 

My last homie(homie)

I went and bought a bird 

Fuck I want some cash homie



[chorus]



[Verse 2:]

I never wrote a nigga coat tail

Made her took a dope sell 

Fuck it nigga oh wells

Smokin on that classified

Rollin in that lac' of mine

Know my mind stay numb to the world half the time

Thinkin bout land rover damn near was fucked up

Found him in the trunk with another dude fucked up

The world fucked up that's why I'm fucked up

Don't get fucked up fuck with me ya fucked up

Bitch I'ma ride, bitch I'ma die

When I holla 305 bitch that's on my life

Got a 40 in the car a choppa in the crib

The grenades down the street you gotta get it how you live

I know niggas turn 1 into 2 and they do what they do

And boy them thangs move

Fishscale get the big mail 

In the room full of work

In case they came when they inhale



[chorus]



[Verse 3:]

It's time for me to cash in laughin

Like Martin in an Aston Martin

When I park it I can see ya bitch heartbeat

So roll out the red carpet roll up the purple shit

Black navigator flew 

Gotta shut ya fuckin mouth don't ever take the smooth

Thinkin of a greater way to build a greater flow

I hope she got some great head that's how I grade a hoe

White beamer in the hood shining like a star

Look this half a key go to the club and I'ma buy the bar

Do it twice a week fuckin bitches on the other nights

Promise E class we'll never miss another fight

Hundred in the bag 5 birds I'ma grab

Turn em' into 8 keep me a clean half

Bakin soda in the work, works wonderful

Ya see ya dream come true cuz I'm the truth

[Intro: Lyfe Jennings (Rick Ross talking)]
It's my time (Rick Ross)
It's my time (Finna' lay back on this shit man)
(Dade County dope boy)



[Verse 1:]

I'm not a slim thug, I'm a fat mack

I don't give a fuck, I'll push ya hat back

Still sellin dubs, nigga, that's fact

You can hit me on the cell pimp, that's that

I had to pawn my chain and grab a half ounce

Ten years later time for me to cash out

You dealin wit a dope dealin dictator

Fuck trafficking nigga, I get this shit catered

See the clip tailored, only the Coogi shit

I fucks wit Damon, I'm in the movies kid

My mom reminisce on the late nights

When I used to reel 'em in with the straight white

'96, Seventeen with a lil' Beamer

First foreign car far from a lil' dreamer

Daddy severed his relationships

I think momma quit him 'cause he wasn't makin shit

Who ever thought that I'd make it rich?

The bottom of the barrel, with a bucket of Crys'

I'm tellin you man... Life a funny thing

You ain't a dope by 'til yo ass got a gun and chain



[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings (ad-libbing)]

It's my time (It's my time, yeah, oh)

It's my time (I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine)

It's my time



[Verse 2:]

Ain't rappin I'm talkin, ain't talkin I'm scrappin

Ain't scrappin, I'm shootin, they just askin what happened

Ain't shoot then I'm shot, ain't shot then I'm shootin

I ain't caught by the cops, fuck the cops I'm eluding

Ain't hearin the sirens, but I'm seeing the sirens

Ain't seeing the sirens, why am I being so violent?

Thats in the nature of being a nigga

Being beat down, then able to get up

Being let down, then able to sit up

Be the false charge, a nigga acquit it

I ain't hating on ya, dog I pray for ya

Be safe, I heard they got a case for ya

Be straight, stay away from them fake lawyers

You'll be working for the state like you they laywers

Stay loyal, your time will come...

For you to be free and shine like the sun

I'm so blessed, to be in this position

Holdin on my .45 listenin to every whisper...

I'm so blessed, to be in this position

Holdin on my .45 listenin to every whisper...



[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings (ad-libbing)]

It's my time (It's my time, yeah, oh)

It's my time (I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine)

It's my time



[Verse 3:]

Other niggaz sleep, I'm on my job

Soon as cats get 'laxed, I'm going hard

Thats the rules of the game for the underdog

Every wonder dog, long as I been going off (Ross!)

I left it in Gods hands...

Block told me once, ""Ross, this is God's plan""

I'm like ""aw, man"", a man run a label like ""Amen""

Sign a Ray Charles, I could see it all

A lot of undercover agents wanna see me fall

See me fell, in the hell of shells

Expired, no liar, I live the tale

I look forward to working with all the real niggaz

I look forward to looking back on drug dealing

I look forward to making my momma smile once

Look forward, just know I'm smoking them loud blunts

Eight-hundred an ounce, while you running ya mouth

I'm loading the guns... Who running the South?

I'm on ya porch, knocking at ya front door

I got my money right nigga, and I want war



[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings (ad-libbing)]

It's my time (It's my time, yeah, oh)

It's my time (I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine)

It's my time (Yeah... yeah... yeaaah)

It's my time (There'll be no stopping me!)

(There'll be no stopping me now)"

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose

Street life , nothin' but the street life

They love they way I shine

This world is mine, all mine



[Verse 1: Rick Ross]

Up early in the morning, got gold in my eye

Got a 4-5 that'll leave a hole in the sky

Sittin at this table, why, to take this {?}

Music and the street life that's a whole 'nother side (riiiight)

Hoes used to call me small time

My clothes ain't know what to call mine

No logos or no tags in it

No polos 'til I started bag-gin' it

Way before my first key

My nigga E showed me

How to parlay a Z (good lookin' nigga)

I know my mama pullin' overtime

Pocket full of dimes

So I'm out here pullin' mine



[Chorus]



[Verse 2: Rick Ross]

You can't close shop, not on my block

I'm 24/7 like IHOP

Came from the bottom to the skybox

Now a penthouse, you can call me Hi-Top

Hop up in the 40-40, got 'bout forty on me

Fifty grand in a band, I'ma roll it homie

Brick layin' cost 'bout another dub

Ten grand for a pound of the bubble bud

Twenty birds in a room down in Atlanta

I caught a bird, but the birds can't buy a camper

Just an example, by an ex-trapper

Dress the coupe in the shoes, now that's dapper



[Chorus]



[Verse 3: Rick Ross]

Street life, sellin' dope, fuckin' hoes

Big E, smoke comin' outta nigga nose

Candy paintin' on the corner, sellin' everything

I'm on the move, I ain't called mama in a couple days

This life and nothin' will ever change that

I love the game and we'll never give the game back

We lost a lotta good niggaz in the game

But in the game, all the good niggaz get a name

I got a name, everybody don't die the same

Like all dope don't fly the same

M-I-Yayo, boy I buy them thangs

It's like the people want me to come fly the plane

Hold up

Who you haters think you talkin' to, I'm the fuckin' boss

White on white, G4, hater get lost

I'm in the air I don't hear niggaz corny raps

Yeah nigga Hov is back, that nigga Hov is back

I got a honey bun, no not a chick

I got a honey bun, millions nigga I got couple hundred 'em

Ninety-nine problems prick, don't become the hundreth one

'Less you got a hundred lives murder bout a hundred, uh

We don't resort to violence, we on resorts and islands

With linen shorts and shades, case they thought you was lyin'

My Louis slippers, Polo top

Linen shorts so my balls don't get hot, ha ha

Yeah I balls a lot, nah I owns the team

Ricky Ross, Roc-A-Fella, I owns the scene

Stop playin' with me lames y'all not my equal

It ain't no coincidence that my age is a kilo

Which means that I'm pordo, which means that I'm gordo

Which means that I use a G4, like in auto

I'm a walkin' memorial

I'm legendary for whippin' whippin' that boss

So nigga just let that cause go

[Verse 2 - Young Jeezy]

Hey, let's go

Snowman bitch, I don't even wear the same draws

Flat screens on my walls, flows look like bowling balls

I know Big Meeks, the real Big Meeks

It's over for you clowns soon as my nigga hit them streets

I see you ridin' homie, but that ain't hard enough

You know me I might pull up in an armored truck

I stack big faces, I stack small faces

I stack all faces, swear it's white as pillow cases

I got a dirty mouth but my kitchen's clean

Them folks ridin' hid the pots and the triple beams

Hit the Dodge spot I must've copped six Magnums

Marriott suite, I must've used six magnums

Feds on my tail, you know them boys'll six flag ya

Testarossa ride, like I'm on a coaster ride

Sheet mix, remix still talkin' white bricks

Two million records sold and I'm still talkin' white shit



[Hook]



[Bridge]



[Verse 3 - Rick Ross]

I'm the fuckin' future nigga, what you can't see the facts

Ya want them pretty things, I'm the one ya need to ask

They come cross the border, I'm fulfillin' ya order

But the second ya bought her, Fed charges get brought up

I'm whippin' the case, like I'm whippin' the base

Look at daddy in face now tell me how good does it taste

Willie Fal-con, I'm the Dow Jones

Down South where them D-Boys ground zones

We never steal cars, what I'm puttin' miles on

Thirty feet, it cost a couple hundred thousand

My shit bigger than your's, at the biddin' wars

I'm the one they biddin' for, dog I'm just the biggest drought

I'm in the distribution, I'm like Def Jam

Release fish scales, scales on my desk man

Handle my problem, that's the way it is
Always talkin' like a bitch but that's the way he is
After the ride, nobody'll know where he is, Triple C!
When you serve a cat a couple of times

Knowin' he serve in a couple of towns

Polaco, Pensacola, down to Duval

It put you in the midn of a pimp like Too $hort

Classy nigga walkin' 'round with stacks

But I'm gettin' word that he talkin' behind my back

Now is the time to listen, you gotta pay attention

He may pay a henchman, put him up on where you livin

Tell him all your cars, makes and models

Tell him how you on steaks and bottles

Opium Sunday, Oxygen Tuesday

How you go to the boxing gym tryin' to lose weight

He done told a nigga all your routes

And now you got a lowlife tryin' to figure you out

Catch you in the driveway, trigger you out

That's what killers about, that's what niggaz allow remember



Nigga please! You ain't a cap peeler

Save that for your bathroom mirror

No platoon dealer; you niggaz baboons

Half gorilla, a camp of scrillers

Triple C stamp the trillest

I got B's I'ma spend it, I don't care what the bill is

Them hoes stay at the billets

And when they ask what year I tell 'em two thousand two million

A rider without a motor, you got it right I'm a solider

Long as it's loaded I'ma tote it

I told ya, flow so cold, below frozen

like ice water over the Pro Tools

But that's old news, update the topic

What makes the prophet cut cake in projects

I'ma show him how cupcake his squad is

Duct tape embalmers for makin' them comments



Nigga I'm fresh out

Beef it really ain't a problem, one call, half of your boys X'd out

Jail ain't rehabilitate shit!

Killers and dealers all I affiliate with

Retaliate and I squeeze mags, you hit you went stiff

and we ain't playin' freeze tag, you better dip

Chop soundin' like a speed bag, that's it, set a date money I'm hungry

So I'm robbin' moms for that wake money

It's Torch, you get a bomb from me, you wan' play?

I survived more athletes than Barry Bonds trainin'

Name 'em, ain't a problem 'til I say it is

Miss a payment I'll be waitin' there, takin' all your favorite shit

Earrings, rings, watches, bracelets

Chains and the flat screen, shawty that 'llac mean

Meanin' it's comin' too, nigga what you wanna do?

I send G to kill you, lay your daddy down in front of you nigga



Y'all niggaz know who this is

Nigga this is the homey nigga

Y'all niggaz don't want no problems nigga

Y'all niggaz see us in the club

Y'all be havin y'all gorillas nigga

But y'all niggaz already know nigga
