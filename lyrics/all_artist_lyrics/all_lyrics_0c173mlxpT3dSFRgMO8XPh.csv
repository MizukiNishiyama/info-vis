Aye, nigga, where you been at, bro?
Always in the studio but ain't never with your son
Come on, baby
Ayo, the city fuckin' with you right now, bruh
Niggas talkin' crazy about you in the hood, bro

Niggas say you ain't even been in it

We speaking two totally different languages

(Shit)

You need to figure your shit out

The city need you, dog, come on man

Them niggas saying you ain't been to the city in over a year, nigga

I just seen yo' daddy drive a Uber, dog, what's good?

(Oh, God)

You need one of them anthems, nigga

You need to figure yo' shit out

You need to diss someone

You should just disappear

We need you, dog

You should just diss a nigga, man, drop a diss track

You don't miss me, bitch"

Straight to the top—that's how I rock (Ayy, ayy)

Ayy



Back to the basics

Back to the work like we back from vacation we never not takin'

We what? (What?) Back to the basics, back to the basement

I love makin' progress you peons not makin'

Bro turn this back on me then push back up on me

I'm not really fazed by his fakeness

I'm cut from a different cloth

Engineered from a different tier type greatness



Okay, let's get it, let's get it

Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, I got it

They love to talk shit but can't top it

I might just style yo' stylist (Oh, God)

They went and did what I did after I did it

Shit, ironic (Damn)

The way that I did what I did

My bitch love to call me iconic (So iconic right now)

Ayy, ayy, ayy (Like, what the fuck?)



The time ain't gon' free up, the contract get read up

Yo' business is fucked

Crackers runnin' it up while they kickin' they feet up (Stupid)

You might as well signed you a prenup, then copped you a Fiat (Swerve)

Don't worry—I got properties that you could rent out

I'm not a new artist, brodie—I been out

These hoes wanna end us, these boys think I'm finished

But I turn the tables like Funk Flex in NY

Yeah, it's gon' all come around like a fisheye

And I'ma need all that love back that I dish out

The peace is Jesús—yeah, I had to go Biggie (Oh, God)

Y'all niggas rap like y'all actin' like Shiggy

I'm in a Mecca you boys can't touch down in

They turn a conscious rapper unconscious

They feed these gangsta rappers to piranhas

They take off yo' Cartier, fill it with diamonds

To put on they eyes just to hide all the trauma

I just ain't rhymin' to rhyme, bitch



We back to the basics

Back to the work like we back from vacation we never not takin'

We what? Back to the basics, back to the basement

I love makin' progress you peons not makin'

Just been all about expansion, you know?
You know they hate when I talk like this
Ayy
I got pimpin' in my blood

Got my main girl in the tub, all she wearin' is some suds

I done bossed up to the point that all I care about is love

Turn the family all execs, no such thing as rich enough

Too Real Under Sean Teachings, acronym for trust (Trust)

Initials in the sheets, got my logo in the rug

Built-in alarm clock, ain't got to tell me to get up

When I walk in the arena, I feel like I'm Jerry Buss (Bust it)

And we shut down Coachella, they thought it was Harry Styles

Except the skin same color as a black and mild

Meditatin' blackin' out, J. Cole, a middle child

But you know I get my fuckin' way, like an only child

Downtown pimpin', city slickin', rockin' crocodile

Yeah, they tryna pipe me down, but you gotta wipe me down

Could tell from my handwriting, I got signature style

I should write a fuckin' book on how to get it off the mile



They used to look right past me (Swerve)

Niggas can't even catch up to the past me (Swerve)

She just wanna love me down and harass me

They want me to play my role, but you can't typecast me (Bitch)

Yeah, typecast me

Makin' sure my son straight, makin' sure my girl straight

Makin' sure the fam straight, then I can die happy

They want me to play my role, but you can't typecast me (Bitch)



Yeah, multi-million dollar salaries, for all of my legalities

And we comin' black tux when we movin' casually

Could build a damn positive affirmation gallery

Passin' plays to my niggas, so the income is passive

My genre isn't rap anymore, it's under classics (Classics)

Look, I knew back on Griswold

When ain't nobody have my back, 'cause it was against the wall

And Waun got hit with that fed case

And he was livin' through me for that decade, to balance his head space

Man, first thing I think about, boardin' a jet

Is how my mom and dad was flight attendants, that's how they met

No wonder why my head's in the clouds, it makes sense

Every day I wake up, I'm one day closer to death

So what you gon' do with the time you got left?

Ball on these pussies, damn, look at my neck

I used to sell CD's outside of my history class

What a foreshadow that was, when I'm lookin' back

From the blog era, had to get through the tabloids

Just like MJ had to get through the bad boys

My son first Christmas, he finna have mad toys

I'll probably get his ass a S-Class if he ask for it

But he gotta learn the hard way, life's a crash course

And stick to the task, while dodgin' the task force (Of course)



They used to look right past me (Swerve)

Niggas can't even catch up to the past me (Swerve)

She just wanna love me down and harass me

They want me to play my role, but you can't typecast me

Yeah, bitch

Makin' sure my son straight, makin' sure my girl straight

Makin' sure the fam straight, then I can die happy

They want me to play my role, but you can't typecast me (Bitch)



They used to look right past me

Ain't wanna do right by me

Fuck it, alright by me (Fuck it)

So I couldn't do this and couldn't do that

But niggas can't typecast me

Niggas can't typecast me, niggas can't typecast me

Fuck it

Better me than you, shit, I gotta see it through"

Funny how nigga tend to believe more than what happened
I mean really, do we look like inglorious bastards?
Lena Waithe told me I was the Black Brad Pitt
I wasn't too fond of that title, flattering as it is

I mean, really though, that's what you think of my rep?

That's what they saying 'bout me, quiet as kept

Like I just go from one star to another star

Like I'm drawing out a constellation or

Go from one hole to another like I'm shooting par, that ain't me at all

I really had to stop what I was doing and start retracing my steps

And had to break some cycles

Sometimes, you don't always win it as much as you like to

But they can't see you out here panicky

You can't expect it to change doing the same, that's insanity

They catch me on the canon moving candidly, and even though I'm out the frame, they pan to me

But I'm so on that I'm well-off, I only ever fell back, not fell off

Fuck it, it's just a different cycle



Sometimes, you gotta go through a different cycle

Cycle, cycle

Oh, is that what you think of me? Is that what you heard?

That ain't even the half of it, nigga, I'm on a different cycle

Come and lift me up

I'm saying, how 'bout instead of tearing me down, you

Come and lift me up

Yeah, how 'bout that?



Look, I got trauma that I haven't dealt with

I got feelings that I haven't gelled with

I got a lot of girls that want to get up and meet

And have a conversation with me after they melt quick

But I can't do to my baby, I'm too solid

I mean so solid to the point that my homeboy is The Rock, shit

You thriving off of gossip, you the type to lose faith and stop it

I'm climbing the mountain even if I can't see the top of it

Living the highs, striving the lows, understand that's a whole different control

I done hit baby, that's Mission Control, ulterior motives that's getting exposed

Not enough money to give 'em my soul, I set the standards, you live up to those

Life speaking through me, it's not Morse code, I cut you off 'cause I'm really that cold

Tryna go stone cold on me but I'm hot

American dollar crashing out but I'm not

This that prime time, baby, I'm in that time slot

Coming to you live, swear these nigga is dying to watch

So fucking busy, she can't tell if I'm lying or not

I just gotta get this shit, I'm on a different cycle



Come and lift me up

Oh, is that what you think of me? Is that what you heard?

That ain't even the half of it, nigga, I'm on a different cycle

How 'bout instead of tearing me down, you

Come and lift me up

Oh, God

Aye, aye



I went and bought my mama a Benz

And then I bought myself one, and she like, ""Look, we twins""

Nice watch, baby boy, but watch how you spend

And make sure that it's a write off, I just want to see you right off

And before you leave that mansion, make sure you cut the lights off

Mama, I know, like I don't work for every dollar of my own

She know I got the heart of Joe and the mind of Mildred

And the rest of the OGs that's woven all through my soul and spirit

Fuck it, I had to break the cycle



Break the cycle of us thinking we don't have enough, ya know?

Living in the illusion of scarcity

She never got her Chanel, but I broke the cycle

Yeah

And I had to get her a red one 'cause she a Delta

And she used to be a flight attendant on Delta, for real



I'm a grown man

But I had to break the cycle

Yes, I did

I said I'm a grown man but I had to break the cycle



Yo, what's up, my brother, great to hear from you, man

So a few things, most importantly, that sounds amazing

Your baby boy's nine months old and thriving, I love hearing that

And I'm sure that

You were, you're an inspired artist to begin with, like right out of the gates

But I'm sure holding your baby boy gives you a whole new perspective on

This new evolution of what inspiration means, right? So I'm sure, man

I'm sure your motivation, inspiration is through the roof every time you hold your baby boy

And what's cool, just

Y-your baby boy at nine months is already almost bigger than Kevin Hart so that's, that's really cool

Alright, my brother, love you, man

And I'm so happy for you, man, can't wait to see your baby boy, okay, bye"

Why would ever deny or go plot against me?

Apologizing

You wanna say you sorry when you not

Wanna be friends and do business man

How could we?

Talk about me 'cause you lost the privilege of talking to me

On God

Dug your own grave, now do what you best at, nigga, lie

Give me the space, give me the time

Get you away, outta my mind

I don't want you in my life no more

I got a line that I've drawn and you act like it isn't one

One of the worst things you could do is waste time

What? Only thing worse is wasting mine, what?

Feeling like OG Lil' Jon, what?

Fuck a little percentage, I would've gave your ass the world

Tryna fuck my girl

Tryna disrespect me, bitch, respect the first thing you gon' give me for sure



I ain't mad at you

Look at you

You was supposed to be big bro

But somehow, you didn't grow

I even tried to lay the play down for the pick and roll

But you couldn't play the roles

Even paid your lawyer fees and you tried to get me from old

Even all the money in the world couldn't fix how you broke

Nigga claim that they solid when they solid as a house of cards

Meaning the more I stack, the more that it's just bound to fall

They wanna take me off of my level

And drag it down to yours

And prove they wasn't down at all

I'ma hold your ass accountable a lot

Oh, surprise I'm on top



Now I'm on top

Ooh, yeah

Oh, I've already forgiven you

For all the things you put me through

So long for now

Are you sorry?

Or are you embarrassed by the way that you treated me?

Is your apology serving?

Accountability starts with self observation

And I can't help you with that

That's a God thing

Said that he'd do it

Go on and hit him up for that

Won't he do it?

I've already forgiven you

For all the things you put me through

You talking 'bout Mother Earth?

If Mother Earth wanted to, she could really wipe us all out just by slightly raising her temperature

And so I wonder

Why does the Earth love us like a mother loves her children?

No matter how bad they are, unconditionally

After all we put her through

You know, so I'm not surprised if some of y'all don't see what I'm saying

But a hundred years from now, probably none of us'll be here

In fact we'll be unplugged and onto the next version of ourselves

But what if while we're in our bodies, this is our only time to

Feel something

Fuck something

Eat something

Feel the sun

Feel the rain

The ups and downs of everything

All the emotions

Aye, I wanna dedicate this one to my son Noah Hasani
Daddy love you, boy, yeah
And everybody just working through what they working through, you know what I'm saying?
Everybody making the best of what they got
Aye, aye, look



I know some OGs always working, but they never paid

Finding their way, but shit, it gotta be a better way

The older that I get, I'm feelin' the resemblance

I look into my son's eyes and still see his innocence

I see my inner child in him and still the remnants

Will he lose it to the world, is it imminent?

Or is it something that me and his momma had instilled in him?

And the confidence you lose, you could build again

He only nine months, barely sittin' up

He almost fell over, I called him and told him

""Gotta get on up""

I'm only makin' plays now to pass it on

One day my baby gon' have babies and I'm gon' be gone

The way time movin', it really won't be long

I pray I'm there for every memory you want me on

I gotta teach him that it's more than a rat race, more than a cash chase

And if you chase cash, that just means that it's running away

Instead of turning what you love into a company, and watch the money come to me

My, what has the world done to me?

Judging people off of how they look, not what they've done for me

Don't assume is number three of the four agreements

I gotta start applyin' everything that I've been reading

It seem like the tragedy of losing kids will never calm

I think about Trayvon, Breon-, my neighbor Deshaun

Prayin' for protection for my family

And that He keep His hands on me to fight through this insanity

I lay down, tryna figure out the rest

Close my eyes, picture heaven, and it's where I'm at, get up



Gotta get on up

You gotta get on up now

'Cause you can't sit down

Gotta get on up

Gotta get on up now

And you can't sit down

Gotta get on up

You gotta get on up now

And you can't sit down

Gotta get on up

And you can't sit down

Gotta get on up now

And you can't sit down

Gotta get on up now

Gotta get on up now

And you can't sit down

Gotta get on up

Gotta get on up now"

Just fall back, would you?
I mean it really ain't, it really ain't
That bad with you, just step back, would you?
Shit, relax

Aye, aye, everybody going through something

I need you to come down now and keep me company

All we did and all we been through, it can't be for nothing

I go so hard on myself, it's self destruction

But everybody going through something

It ain't even 'bout what's real, it's 'bout what you trusting

Channel all that energy, fuck all that fuck shit

Man, everybody going through something

Everybody going through something, yeah



I been down and uneven, I been drowning and sinking

Popping 30mgs for no reason

Pops say it's always a reason

Just like it's always a season

You gotta know when to breathe in

You so good at putting time in

But not taking time out when you need

So scared of losing everything that you already feel defeat

Try to bury your problems deep down

Not knowing they're deceased

You MIA half the time, your cousin crashed

Got a shattered spine, he can't even walk up to his baby crying

You ain't even check in to make sure he fine

Shit, because everybody's going through something

You steady tripping on dumb shit

You like to tell me I'm kidding around

When a baby is all that you wanted

Sometimes, we pray and ask God for these things

And not realizing all it come with

I feel like you don't really hear me, though

You know I like being alone, but not feeling alone

You know I live in my head, it's like my second home

I know you tryna help, it's hard to accept it, though

Please don't judge me



Aye, aye, everybody going through something

I need you to come down now and keep me company

All we did and all we been through, it can't be for nothing

I go so hard on myself, it's self destruction

But everybody going through something

It ain't even 'bout what's real, it's 'bout what you trusting

Channel all that energy, fuck all that fuck shit

You don't want me, but I want you
Bad news, bad news
I can't stop dreamin' about you
I'm letting go

This time

You crossed the line, I'm done with that

Disrespect, ain't havin' that

You say you don't give a fuck, but you so attached

Not too worried about you fuckin' other nigga now

Build me up and now my ego just won't let me down

Take me down, protect me how?

Just let me drown

I always let you down



Too much time, I'm done with that

I'm lettin' go, you crossed the line

It's no comin' back, gotta see the signs

I'm not goin' back 'cause you say it's fine

Wastin' time, dirty, ain't worthy, ain't worth me

Got my phone blowin' up like Kirby

How we together but you tryna curve me?



How we together but you curve me?

How you say you love me but you always hurt me?

Even you told me you don't deserve me

And then talk down on me like I ain't worthy

Tryna move forward but you won't reverse me

To a place where we wasn't workin'

Actin' sweet, know you gon' desert me

Talkin' all spiritual and all churchy

Say you on my team, I can't find the jersey

Know you gon' find somethin', you keep searchin'

Who you fuckin' with don't concern me

Unless you really cold enough to burn me

And if it ain't no time then we can't be rushed

How yo' friends gon' hate on us

When they was the ones that matched us up?

If it was them, they wouldn't pass me up

If you trust me, it can't be much

Awkward silence every time we talk

All the problems keep pilin' up

You ain't never gon' love the full me

You ain't never gon' back me up

You ain't never gon' set me free

And let the one for me snatch me up

You wanna need me and wanna bleed me

But never there to come patch me up

When you thinkin' through, is it good for you?

Just remember you is only half of us

Remember you is just half of us

Remember you is just half of us



Driftin' through the void

I'm done with you

I'd rather be on my own

Too many times

I'd rather be on my own

Back into the void

Back into the void

Turn it off, be alone

Turn it off, be alone

Turn it off, be alone

I'd rather be on my own

I'd rather be on my own

All alone, run along

All alone, all alone



All alone, all alone

All alone

Black void, Black boy

All alone, all alone

Came into it just like how I'm goin' home

All alone

All alone

All alone

Ain't nobody from the crib ever did it big like this

Had to watch from the bench, I had to sit through it

I hope the same damn demons don't haunt me

Come with the Don like members only

When I'm done, they'll probably put my bones in museums

Like that's one of the last from niggas, ever

'Cause at this rate, we'll all be extinct then

She spend a night with me and now she want a million weekends

Shallow hoes, always fallin' in love with the deepest

I'm in the deep end, my city population eight-hundred thou'

But on my block alone you'll find a million pieces

And that's what we chop you in, doggy

If you try to test us or cheat us

Or if we don't like the way you treat us

Or it might just be the season

I used to want to be a millionaire for, shit, like a million reasons

And then it came with a million leeches that want that many pieces

Lawyers, taxes, state taxes

Agents, assistants, managers, business managers

Fees and damages

Plus somebody else, to make sure that they're not scammin' us

Shit'll have you depressed, checkin' your balances

Luckily, it's me, I know how to balance it

All of the tears, let 'em dry

I look at myself, got a million mirrors to help



Overnight, everythin' can change

All of a sudden, I'm the one to blame

I'm still learnin' what I need, baby, so I can't say I'm here to stay

Plus I'm goin' so damn hard, man, I can't even find the day

On my free time, I just take the Grand Ave down to PCH

Man, this came from a million pieces

The mindset that I beat the streets with

Military tactics, yeah, it's that strategic

You fake woke, but I'm still dreamin'

I put my heart in this shit, my nigga, and made it look easy

I do the mink for the certain seasons

I go hard for a certain reason, I gotta keep eatin'

Man, this so special

Ain't been a Larry this big, since the Boston Celtics

I done put my life together from— (A million)

Uh
Nobody said it was gon' be easy
I look up

I gotta start settin' boundaries

'Cause everybody want a part of me, now I'm a piece of me

Been dealin' with the part of me that people hardly see

I gotta fall back and just get organized

Soak off in the sun rays and get fortified

I gotta start back wakin' up early mornin' time

I gotta feed my soul, 'cause it's cryin' out

I gotta execute, no more tryin' now



I could tell you I'm doin' well, but it's dryin' out

I gotta pour back into the things that make me smile

I see the world on fire when I step out the house

I gotta pay attention to everythin' I'm puttin' out

No more setbacks, it's time for the get-backs

Killed my old habits dead, somehow they crept back

Made it from the underground, they wishin' I'd trip back

Wan' bury me alive, but I thrive in the pitch-black

My favorite question I used to ask is ""God, why me?""

But God don't give what you want, God give you what you need

You don't regret havin' a child, but havin' it with him?

Until you have miscarriages and realize giving birth's the most magical thing

And we don't choose them, they choose us as worthy beings

Understand your word's like a double-edge sword

So when you cut things off (Off)

A little bit of blood on that blade just might be yours

Remember, time ain't runnin' out, life just runnin' its course

And life ain't life if it's feelin' forced



That's why I gotta start settin' boundaries

'Cause everybody want a part of me, now I'm a piece of me

Been dealin' with the part of me that people hardly see

I gotta fall back and just get organized

Soak off in the sun rays and get fortified

I gotta start back wakin' up early mornin' time

I gotta feed my soul, 'cause it's cryin' out

I gotta execute, no more tryin' now"

Woke up to a PYT telling me get up

Through all of the pressure, I'm keeping my chest up

Tupac keep ya head up, they aim for the neck up

Plotting but, fuck it, I'm set to go set up

The bitches that's setting me up for the set up

Pushing a V and it's not for Vendetta

I'm hungry as ever, but somehow, I'm fed up

A smooth operator, I could connect ya

I only love a few, I gotta protect ya

I got a talent for turning whatever life throw at me into a blessing

I love your company, but I rather be by myself than to fake a connection

I'm too accountable, yeah, savings 'n checkings

Damn, the caucasity, you can address me, but bitch, ain't dragging me (Hol' up)

I took the time out for inner peace

And came back with a bigger piece

I'm taking what I want, it's not a reach

B.I.G in my city, only bigger one it mighta been was Big Meech

200 million bricks, 200 million records, he the only one that could compete

Either way, though, the fam gotta eat

They wanna talk business, but what can bring to it?

You know I don't propose a plan unless it has a ring to it

Never stuck, just sticking to the script, reading through it

This is half man, half God-given

Insufficient funds, half my life till the other half caught up with it

If the gang ain't going half with me, then it's bad business

If they want my spot, then they gotta come for me
Just know I want this shit more than whatever it is you want from me
And the only thought at night that comforts me is starvin' whoever's huntin' me
Shit, lucky me, to be rich in a world where nothing's free
And separated from hell by one degree

Surrounded by niggas who did first degree

And the other ones that never got they first degree, sheesh

Lucky me (Nigga!)

Yeah, I done slashed hoes like I'm Slash on some rock star shit

Even bought Slash old crib, that's rock star as it gets

And have my hands on the R&B legends you couldn't handle

Whether you do music or not, you wish you could sample

And I had to live through the scandals

Public humiliations and breakups on camera

It's a living nightmare when your dream girl has to get canceled

And you gotta delete all the photos and shit like you never Instagrammed it

And you get off-track but somehow you gotta stay transit

Man, lucky me

I was diagnosed with a heart disease at 19

Could barely stand on my feet

Doctors said they had to cut it open, put a pacemaker on it to put it back on beat

'Til my mama took me to holistic doctors and they prescribed me magnesium for two weeks

Went back to the regular doctors and they said, ""Huh, damn, looks like we don't need to proceed""

That's how I know that western medicine weak

Man, lucky me, to be the chosen one

And saved for the special occasions like I was Opus One

You know, and I'ma live forever like Walt Disney, the frozen one

Done flew so many times past the limit, I didn't even know it was one

And face our problems head-on when they told us to run

And ran it up in a city where no one would come

When I had literally died but then came back alive

And it's the furthest thing that I know from over and done

And I don't even have to say it, you know where I'm from, bitch (Yeah, yeah)

Lucky me, lucky who? (Lucky) Lucky, true

It's a wonder what prayer, working smart and love can do

And y'all got an efficient and humble crew

And you got a long list of the things y'all wanna do

Shit, who knows, lucky me can turn into lucky you

We turned nothing to something so much it's nothing new

I know lady luck so well, I swear that's like my bottom bitch, number two

Doing what we love and choose with lots to lose and more to prove

Ain't running from nothing but haven't lost sight of the finish line that we been runnin' to

Lil' bitch, this Detroit-fucking-2

My thoughts is all-black, yeah, I'm back to the roots

Fuck your white flag, ho, I don't want no truce

And we all in the huddle, they like, ""It's on you""

Hm, lucky me (Me), pressure's what I eat

Ain't no roses at my feet, just the blood on the concrete, look (Hit-Boy on the beat, so bitch you gotta go berserk)



The mission is covert

I stuck to the code and you don't know the code word

Once they start me up then just know that it's over (Woah, woah)

And she told me that her lil' bro wanna be me when he older (That's facts)

I know you don't know me

I'm buffed up, my chest up, I feel like Hulk Hogan

I walk in the building like everybody owe me

Move heaven on Earth, this shit feel like erosion

The Don, I'm the king, I'm consultin' the soldiers

You talk to me nice and not real, I'm insulted

I bet on myself, ain't no way my hand's folding

What's a limitation? Fuck your validation

I don't got a figure, God flow, got it renovated

Demon slayer and my bitch slayin', legendary, it's insinuated

Two guards outside barricaded while I'm serenadin' (Yeah)

Paradise covin' while I'm stroking

Pussy tight, I'm claustrophobic

She so damn down and devoted

Got me wondering what's her motives (What's her—)

Remember my feelings don't mean shit to none of my goals, so I gotta stay focused

The city is soulless, this shit get too vulgar

G. Ry got me
Look
Fuck rap, I'm a street legend, block love me with a deep reverence
I was birthed in a C-section

Hella cops and police presence, we got opps so we keep weapons

We on y'all block while y'all eat breakfast

A lot of shots, we broke street records

Watch how you talk, I got reflexes, watchin' your cheap necklace

Then we slide out the East exit

But every time we get to fuckin' niggas up, TMZ catch it

Yeah, I still learn the street lessons

From the mastermind, first you master grind, then your team catch it

This time is for the money, I don't need credit

But I'm the don 'cause the streets said it, look



Fuck rap, I'm a street legend

But I'm the don 'cause the streets said it

Block love me with a deep reverence (Yeah, woah)

But I'm the don 'cause the streets said it (Yeah)



And I got pressure on me

Seven days a week, it's game seven on me

Life'll test you out, you live through that, that's testimony

Givin' them hell, but how in the hell I got all these blessings on me?

Most of the girls I know addicted to social media

All the time they put in, they could've wrote encyclopedias

Mama said it only takes one time to fuck up your whole Wikipedia

And as your son, I can see the type of light that you see me in

After what happened to Nipsey, I reached out to Kendrick

It wasn't even no real issues there to begin with

Lack of communication and wrong information

From people fueled by their ego, it's like mixin' flames with diesel

Energy crazy, I realized that it's a two-way street

What's comin' is goin', if it don't give you more, it drains you

Should be a billionaire based on the time off I'm not takin'

Probably why the shit with me get crazy and we lost a baby

And everybody around me think I'm the one

But we all just one of ones

And I'm walkin' out the crib, they ask me where I'm goin'

I told them, ""I'm goin on another ten year run""

Niggas is bangin' over blocks that they don't own, thinkin' that's home

Boy, you think that's where you from? You don't really know where you from

You don't how deep your roots is or what your ancestors had done

So, God bless all of the sons and daughters

Who knew they histories so they knew where to take it farther

And all the ones that stuck with me like good barbers

Lookin' at my life story, God's a good author

Never was the loudest in the room, we move like ninjas

And if it cost your peace of mind, it might be too expensive

So I can't give you everything that you want from me for free though

Get you one shot in life, you might not be able to reload

So advanced, I need all my advances

Bro hit me up for cash like we didn't have the same chances

My dad hit me up like, ""Why I don't live in a mansion?""

I'm tryna focus, but baby girl keep holdin' my mind for ransom

And that ain't how it supposed to be, this man Hov got to a B

And his name Shawn too, I almost felt like it was me

Damn, I realized all my setbacks were inside of me

In high school I learned chemistry, biology

But not how to cope with anxiety

Or how I could feel like I'm by myself on an island with depression on all sides of me (Damn)

With a Glock .17 right on the side of me (Hol' up)

Look, I ain't think I had the thought of suicide in me

Until life showed me all these different sides of me

Too many times I thought the reaper was outside for me

And how the fuck it's people that never met me that hate me?

I wonder if they understand that I meditate daily

And feel like my life purpose is to give inspiration

Despite the hit songs that there's just no escapin'

That I take care of my family and beat the odds that were deadly

You hate that, that just reflects your lack of succession, bless 'em

If it ain't Nipsey blue, it's Detroit blue

This that Detroit 2, I'm bringin' it back to the hood like D-Boys do

Gone



So, the collaboration though, with Nipsey and who?

Aw man, I'd probably say Payroll, look, or Tee Grizzley

Me and Big Sean talked about doin' somethin' recently, too

So, you know, all of them, I'ma, I'ma tap in with all of Detroit

I know, I had people in my circlе but they weren't in my cornеr

I had people in my business, but they didn't support it

But took advantage of me like they supposed to do it, their moments

Everything you didn't do, but could've did if you wanted

Working overtime, it's time I could be taking you down

Real shit, I gotta quit acting like these niggas don't want my place

When I ain't around, even though niggas ain't threats

I know if I don't live with you, I gotta live with my regrets

I might walk in while you showering

Hit you in yo' shower cap, you gripping on the towel rack

I'm bussin' while you buss back

In the bathtub pouring champagne on that ass like I'm Dame Dash

Goddamn, yo' last nigga blew it with his lame ass



Bring that body to me

Baby, come closer, closer

Bring it to me

Oh, yeah, baby, I'll give you ecstasy

Baby, come closer, closer

Bring it to me, ooh, yeah



Late night conversations, can you speak my body language?

I ain't got no time to waste, you got me losing patience

I can't wait to get you over here and get you naked

I'm about to ride that dick so crazy, I might break it

I'm so horny, show me something

Body to body, cheek to cheek, soulful moaning



Bring that body to me

Baby, come closer, closer

Bring it to me

Oh, yeah, baby, I'll give you ecstasy

Baby, come closer, closer

Bring it to me, ooh, yeah



Girl, I'm talkin' body to body

Cheek to cheek, soulful moanin'

And girl, your lips taste so sweet

Girl, I'm talkin' body to body

Cheek to cheek, soulful moanin'

Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah



In the city of murder, mayhem and narcotics

We got enough problems

Now it's time for that (Soulful moanin')

0vEKwBlSpnvzE0Fqk3X1C8,Story By Dave Chappelle,5iJvtKGTQRIo2KL42xS7JX,Detroit 2 (Deluxe),0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh,Big Sean,155166,,2022,"There's never been a single time
Not a, not a-one, that I've ever been to Detroit
Where it wasn't some kind of adventure
City is fucking crazy, it's like, it's palpably alive
It's an entity, it's not like just a place you go
It's Detroit

And one of the reasons that Detroit is my favorite market

Is because the audiences in Detroit, for a comedian

I find them to be particularly challenging

So when I go there, in this particular story

It seemed likе a pretty benign night

And I'm sittin' in the drеssing room at the Fillmore

And there's an older gentleman in there

And I don't really talk to the guy much, but he was a nice guy

Cool energy, shit like that

And then, famed Detroit rapper Danny Brown came in

Now this time, I wasn't that familiar with Danny Brown's music

You know what I mean?

So when he asked me to smoke with him, I just smoked with him

I didn't hear all that ""Adderall! Adderall!"" and all that shit

I didn't know he was about that life (Haha)

I'm assuming it's weed, I don't know what the fuck it was

But, boy, I mean, I smoked weed a million times in my life

Never, ever remember feeling this way any before

And as I was walking on stage, I told my road manager

""You know, my number's up tonight""

He said, ""What does that mean?""

I'm going to bomb

And true to my professional prescription, I did

But, there's bombing in there and there's shit that happens in Detroit

It's like, the crowd was with me

But the way the crowd responded to me widely

Was one of my favorite crowd interactions ever

And as the set is going terribly

When it's clear I'm not gonna be able to pull the nose up and I'm gonna have to crash this thing

I saw Danny Brown slipping out the room, which made me laugh really hard

Go back in dressing room and everyone, you know there's a stink on ya after you bomb

Where everyone looks at you like, you know what I mean?

Like Headwound Harry, like, ""Nigga, are you okay?""

But I really, I can't explain it to ya, I really didn't care

And then, and then, it turns out

That this kind older gentleman, is Big Sean's father

And my goodness what the, the, he gave me a pep talk that only a dad could give

And it made me feel wonderful, man (Wow)

So shoutout to you Big Sean, shout out to Detroit

I'll never stop loving your city, and I'll never stop loving you, bro

You guys are the truth, much love to the Motor City"

Woah, woah, woah
I know we gon' make it if Mike WiLL Made-It, yeah
New tags, toe tags (Woah, woah)
No more breaks, dawg, it's time to break hearts (Break hearts)

I don't take disrespect, I take charge (Woah)

I'm in the mirror lookin' at a work of art (Like, God)

Hard work don’t mean shit if it ain't smart (Ain't smart, ooh)

I'ma run the play up to the max (Like that)

So if I don't know you, don't owe you, I gotta tax (Woah, woah)

I got enough sense, and I slipped through the cracks (Woah)

And, nowadays, I wear my smile like a mask

I'm the idols I looked up to in my past

All natural, Doctor Sebi, you gon' have to CBD me

I been watchin' what they feed mе (Woah, woah)

I like when she tеll me with her body language that she need me (Yeah)

See my third eye is on left eye, I can't let them Eazy-E me

No sir (Sir), Ion’t even do flu shots

Clique with me everywhere I go, so every pic a group shot (Shot)

I done wiggled out the noose knot (Damn)

They been lyin' to me my whole life, I finally found the truth out (God)

Like they don't gotta love you if they need you (Woah)

Got angels and demons on a three-way (Woah)

And they ain’t comin' to no agreement

And I still be feelin' broke again, if I'm gettin' money

And my team ain't gettin' cream until we cremate (Whew)

Big headlines, I'm talkin' CNN (CNN, woah)

I see a hatin' bitch like, ""Hi, it’s me again"" (Me again, woah)

They like ""Why you feel so good?"" (Man)

I'm like ""Why I need a reason?"" (Straight up, straight up, straight up)

Lot of salt, lot of shade bein' thrown my way, man

I guess it's just a season (Damn, throw it)



But I gotta thank God though

'Cause he got me workin' harder than my demons (Woah, woah)

God got me workin' harder than my demons (Woah)

God got me workin' harder than my, hol' up

God got me workin' harder than my demons

God got me workin' harder than my demons

God got me workin' harder than my-



Luther Vandross, never too much (Too much)

Now we two up, who, us?

Yeah, real ones learn the work through us (Through)

Baby girl wanna dance, wanna groove, wanna vibe

But you know my best move is the one where you end up on my side

The ground on the mountain top feel the same as rock-bottom (Bottom)

Quit my fuckin' job, that’s when the real work started

Still showed up every mornin', every evenin' of every season (Straight up, woah)

What's the reason? God got me workin' harder than my-



Demon (Mmm)

Harder than my demons (Demons, harder than my demons)

Harder than my demons, demons, demons, demons

I been fightin' every season

Harder than my demons"

That shit is in you
You ain't gotta try that hard
I just want you to know that
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh-oh)

There’s no romancin' without the pain

Just like there's no loss without some gain

Just like there’s no day without a blessin'

Just like no paydays without finessin'

But when who hurt you's forgiven

And all the late nights you been wishin' (Finally pay off)

Finally pay off and go the distance

I pray you get everything you missin'



Everything you missin', dawg

I pray you get everything you missin'

Everything you missin’

I pray you get everything you missin’

(Oh-oh, oh)



I'm ’bout to delete my Twitter and follow my intuition

Been in and out the mud, but somеhow I'm in mint condition

I wonder if Granddad would have seen thesе Instagram vixens

Every fifteen minutes, but he outdid everything that he did or he didn't

I wonder how it feel to be rappin'

Swear that’s my fuckin' passion, how it feel to go platinum?

Swear that's my dream, but he too blind to see that

If he doin' what he love in his freetime, then his dream already happened

It's not about the trophy, it's about what it took to grab it

And if you feelin' stagnant, just know you attractin' the energy

That you put out there, you a walkin' magnet

Life can be a struggle, but what isn't that's worth havin'? Huh?



There's no romancin' without the pain

Just like there's no loss without some gain

Just like there's no day without a blessin'

Just like no paydays without finessin'

But when who hurt you's forgiven

And all the late nights you been wishin'

Finally pay off and go the distance

I pray you get everything you missin'



Everything you missin', dawg

I pray you get everything you missin'

Everything you missin'



New life start with a blank canvas

Tryna find yourself, you moved to Lost Angeles

Where the camera's off, you're still not off camera

And that meeting that's supposed to change your life keep getting canceled

Swear my prayers gon' get answered 'fore these execs'll answer

Shit, expenses get too expensive

But you gon' do what it takes to do the digits

Even do the dishes

'Cause you gotta prove to the world how you committed

You got a whole city to inspire

It's so cold in the D, so through they eyes, you on fire

Going platinum once like catching lightning in a bottle

But you do it fifty times

And you realize contracts say a lot between the lines

But through the ups and downs, you make a blueprint that the city can build they own way out

And when they do, it's gon' feel like that you almost did it

And you buy everything you want, but it barely make you different

And find out random bitches can't even compare to commitment

And you learn hearin' doubts doesn't mean you have to listen

And you can't believe how much you made, not money, a difference

And find out everything you had was everything you missin'"

Shit lost, it's-it's a lost motherfuckin' art

I want the people out there in the world to hear me, though

I don't do it alone



Drop all that jealousy, that shit is gon' hurt you (Hurt you)

Quit givin' energy to ones that don't deserve you (They don't deserve)

You know everything come full circle

I just show love, watch it come full circle

And I could never let the bad vibes inside my circle, nah (Right now)

And loyalty deserves you (Yeah)

And tell the fuckin' truth even when it hurts to (Yeah-yeah)

But the most money come before the verse too (Straight)

Don't worry, it'll come full circle (Yeah, look)

Not Big Sean, but ""I Don't Fuck With You""
It's 'cause I'm from D, the other D
But Detroit had a special place in my heart
Creative, deep, rooted, organic, cosmic
Fantastic, futuristic, ancient, musical

When I think of Detroit, I think of these things

There's something in that dirty water that gives it its flavor

There's an invisible intelligence that runs through the streets

Like an underground rooting system

Millions and billions of memories of atoms of all of the beautiful music that has been created there

And I've seen it еvolve into, thangs only felt in the hеart

I know this to be true

Thank you, Berry Gordy, for that little house

Thank you, Stevie Wonder, for always calling me and reminding me that it is there

That thang

I always long to reconnect with it when I lose my way musically

Thank you, J Dilla, for your peculiar, peculiar intelligence

Yeah, Detroit just has a magic and I know it to be true

Not Big Sean, but ""I Don't Fuck With You""

Live from Badu-bootron

To be a phenomenon

Detroit: where the nubians grow"

I didn't know I gave it everything 'til I realized that I had nothing else left

Issues bleedin' over from my past life (Tryna take care of everybody)

(I don't know)

I wonder

I wonder if my karma's up and this is my last life to get it right

Transcend (Transcend, transcend)



The days are getting shorter, I noticed

Seems like time is moving fast forward while I'm in slow motion (Slow)

Losing loved ones with really no one to cope with

It's cool, my third and my fourth eye open, damn

(Thank you, God, so much)

I dodged a cell, but still locked on the cell

I never thought I'd see the day my mom wouldn't agree with Oprah and Gayle

Myra Denise was my peace, a heaven on earth and living hell

Who gave me everything, but never took anything for herself

Imagine '06 Impala with zero mileage

Seventeen, baggy clothes, not like Billie Eilish

Some niggas grow old but not up, they still as childish

Demons wearin' mask as my friends, they favorite disguises (Woah)

But niggas not gon' forget about me like niggas forgot 'bout how

Harriet was supposed to be on top of that twenty dollars (Straight up)

Dawg, my life a scene out of Casablanca, you got it wrong, I'm the monster

Burning Man, Ayahuasca (Burning), my check on no diagnostics (Woo)

You disappear in the D like you Jimmy Hoffa (Gone)

I play my part like Leo without the Oscar (Damn)

Underrated, but you still gotta watch it

Yeah, maneuvered through it, I had to do it (Do it)

Show's lookin' like Latin music

'Cept tonight we in Houston, the next night is Chattanooga (Oh)

But it's still Latins that's rappin' to it (Oh)

Pursuit of happiness, I had to prove it

The best part 'bout problems is problems all come with solutions

That's why I don't focus on no legacy shit

All I care about is pluggin' friends and fam, that's it (That's it)

And being the missing link to all their goals and dreams, that's it

And sinkin' the winning shot while I'm triple teamed for the chip, bitch



And I'ma let my whole soul glow

I can't kick it with you no more, can't miss no more goals

Best linens and my bitch sound like she Yoko Ono

When the reaper say it's time to go, I'ma say, ""No, no, no""

(How I'm supposed to leave all this? For what?)



People are hungry for

For something that means, really means something

They're hungry, man, they're like, fucking

You know what I mean? They...

Because they're starving, they get so much bullshit, you know? Bullshit, there's so much of it



What's my purpose?

Why is my purpose?

Where is my purpose?

I am purpose

Made a way out of no way, I did shit different (Go)

Man, fuck that tea shit, this that ""Supa Dupa Lemonade"" (Uh-huh)

Took it back to where we started just to see how far we came

I heard you keep what you love that's valuable inside your safe

I keep mine inside my heart, I guess we value different things (God)

I make all my haters proud of me when I'm in this mentality

Had people that loved me doubted me, but that bring the best out of me

They studying my every move, go get your ass a damn degree

You listen to me, I listen to you, like that ain't it, chief

I bought a house so fucking big it feel like I'm my neighbors

I told my weed man, ""I need nature,"" he accommodate me

I got two choppers look alike, I call 'em crock and gator

I stand beside a baby, see who you decide to play with

I'ma take my fucking chances, I'm a lucky bastard

My heart race 'til it catch up to who it's running after

I know yayo white and sweeter than a yellow bone

Hit him in his shit with this fifty or thirty, duh

Name a nigga out of the D as solid as me

I unlocked a lot of dollars, nigga, knowledge is key

I did it all without a college degree

I went from hottest signed artists, don dada, to G

Street lord, rock bottom, Godfather, and P

D-Boy, Rottweiler, Sean, Sada, and Tee

Standin' on the corner three days

Phone is on Motorola prepaid

Theodora or gold Ellesses

These are ordered from the older East Bays

She either rollin' with the owners or the leesees

A kind man knows a blind man holds grudges

A wise man knows a wise man knows nothin'

I thought I told you motherfuckers I ain't need a budget

I ride with them guys that society begrudges

We been thuggin' worldwide, got arenas buzzin'

We survived gettin' fronted by Ilina cousin

Before you could sell that Cole and Odell

Or go NFL, be Kobe or Kells

The plight of the rich is to throw you in jail

The fight has been fixed since the openin' bell

And you know who postin' your bail? Who promotin' your L?

Call the aura great while they make great wrestle docs

Bitch, you have never said a clever line ever

You murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth

Rest assured, I'ma treat this roof like I'm peelin' off

The plastic on a pill bottle, I'm tearin' the ceilin' off, yeah

Ripping rappers like they were wrapped in saran, bitch

And I'm strapped up with ammunition

And single-handedly takin' over the game like I had an actual hand missing

But I only need one to clap

Animal ambition

The only fuckin' way that you're strapped is for cash

Wish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin' imaginary little handgun you're brandishin'

Bitch, if you pull up with the stick

It's a car with a manual transmission

The chances are low to none that I will overcome my bipolar one

Voodoo dolls, I'm just pokin' fun, pins to me are like loaded guns

When I'm holdin' one, if I'm just fiddlin' with it

This motherfucker discharges like me checkin' myself out of the fucking mental hospital

And I get off like an acquittal, I spit it, you critique it

It feels like I'm bein' belittled by midgets

It's like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka

And walkin' right up the middle of little kids' fuckin' pillow fight with it

You want smoke? I'm like hookah

Man, I remember back when I used to get jumped for my fucking Pumas

Run home and go fuck my room up

These streets will try to vacuum you up

That's why the avenue where I grew up was 8 Mile and Hoover (What?)

'Cause it sucked like a Roomba

But even if I would've went the indie route

I don't have any doubt

I would still get blown like it's windy out

Shoot 'til the clip is emptied out

This is the beginning of the ending, but I'll put another clip in and spit these rounds

If I dig deep down when I'm in my bag like Fendi

Who am I offending now?

Got so many fucking detractors, feels like I'm gettin' plowed

Had to put my money on a diet, I got too many pounds

You would think I'm turnin' pages the way that I'm flippin' paper

Middle fingers, them bitches get to wavin' like friendly neighbors

I'm talkin' loot like I'm rioting

Dick is so big, I can't fit the entire thing through a tire swing

I don't think it would be logic to say that I'm retirin'

But I should say bye-bye, earthlings

'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this ""Grindin'"" beat, yeah

I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song

You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart

So when I'm rippin', it's hard to tell whether if it is really because

Of how offensive I am, or just what a bitch that you are

Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul

Like I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and I'm quick on the draw

Yeah, so when I pull it, surprise like Kendrick Lamar

You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog

'Cause y'all are missing a heart

Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz

This shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping

Y'all got detention tomorrow

I'm severe like Benzo withdrawal

Bitch, your skin's gonna crawl

I'm invincible, I've been through it all

Like I never thought about just ending it 'til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall

My back was against

Now I rap like I'm possessed, that's nine-tenths of the law

Oh

Oh, fuck it"

I was blessed to be raised in the west side of Detroit
I lived on Breckenridge, that was the first home that we lived in
My neighborhood, where I was raised up
When the girls came around, I would sing
On the front porch, beating on the stairs and singing

For hours and hours upon hours

Seeing a piano for the first time

But the amazing thing as well is

Through those experiences, I was able to understand how

My being blind because my mother allowed me to be free

Didn't mean that I had to be blind to the world

I may have had a visual disability

But did not stop my vision inside me

I didn't know what it was like being poor

Because God had made me rich

Even before I was born

Rich with the spirit of knowing that

Anything you imagine that's for the good is possible to be a reality

Because a few weeks before I was discovered, I

I had a dream that I heard my music, my record on the radio

I had nothing out, no one knew who I was, and, um

Amazing, it really happened

And so you know, it's just, it's...

I, I, I can say to other young people as I said to my son Kiland

I said, ""Listen, what you don't understand

Is that God gave you a brand even before you were born

All you had to do in life is walk into it"""

Under unrealistic measures is the only way you can measure who's chosen

I realized my mind frame is too big for the portrait

That's why I'm steady tryna teach the whole hood corporate

Off psychedelics while a physic tryna read my fortune

But I know knowing too much of anything can be a torture (Yeah)

You think I did when I didn't (What?)

You think I paid for everything and didn't pay attention

Like my head is as big as my name (Come on)

Just tell a real nigga once, baby, never again (Swerve)

And I'll put you and all my loved ones on like it's my only obligation

I made all they solid wins a loud proclamation

A little pressure and a lot of patience

They tell me you amazing, I say no, God amazing



Look at all the souls I saved (Straight up)

Look at all the O's I made (Yeah)

Same outfit a couple of days (What about that part?)

Listen to Big Sean (Okay, praise)



But just remember it's easier for mothafuckas to count you out than it is to count you in

So you gotta understand if they don't see where you comin' from or if they small-minded

And not thinking that it's enough for all of us to get it

That's why it's important to be your own boss

To some capacity you know, put yourself in control

Through the ups and downs, wins and losses, they all just chapters

Chapters in your life story and really

Some losses teach you how to win you know

Some losses teach you more than always winning ever could (Yeah, ayy)

And I been there back against the ropes, against the wall

(I ain't tryna waste nobody time, don't waste mine)

That's just 'cause you the one that can handle it, you know?

Shit man, you gotta prove yourself

You gotta rise the fuck up (Up)

Show 'em who you are, man (Yeah)

You ain't gonna give me a way? Okay, cool

I'ma make a way, you feel me?

(Look at all these roads I paved, nigga)

Ain't no mistakes, ain't no regrets

Regrets only there 'cause you ain't learned your lesson (All the times I ain't cave)

Or forgave yourself, either or (Yeah, ayy)

Yeah (All we do is elevate), elevate

The universe been throwing me all the signs except stop it

Niggas been plotting on me, but here's the plot twist

I can't throw fits no more unless it's profits

Lord, why you keep boxing me in, 'cause I'm God's gift?

I might set my mic back up in the closet, though

Just to give myself that same feeling from '04

When my hunger was more, advice to you and yours

They say it's over for you, that's when you go overboard, okay?

Shit, I didn't take a break, my nigga, I broke

Broke my heart, broke my soul, don't cry for me though

If you don't break nothing down then it's no room to grow

One mental block lead to another, shit it's dominos

Mixtape Sean, but I'm in album mode, ooh

She give me praise, I love her angel face

Ass so fat she could work at TSA (Damn)

I went to school at Cass, Aaliyah went to DSA a mile away

Just letting you know the types of kings and queens my city make and I probably need a parade

All the soldiers with me, this shit like green beret

So legendary, I'ma probably need a day (June 29th)

Forgot I already got one, be dammed if I'm not one

You talking 'bout the hottest in the city, most influential rappin' ass niggas and I'm the top one

Me and Em' knocked down doors for y'all that was locked once

I know they may never get me, I still put on for the city like the Lions first round picked me

I ain't been fucking I been too busy, I got two phones they both business, I got fake ones tryin' to end me

I got real ones gon' defend me like a fucking co-defendant

I got Don Life on my pendant, I’m conditioned to do the distance

And I just set up the pensions, family set like my intentions

Been balancing trying to keep my company with the girls who wanna keep my company

You know the ones who claim they over me but would much rather be under me

Is confident and been through too much just to be done with me

And you know that shit gets stressful right?

Shit taxing, the same thing that got Wesley Snipes

And you know how I'm rocking, rocking Elvis Presley white

You know highlight reelin'

All highlights like we sitting on top of museum ceilings

No more resisting

If you ain't on my frequency, you out of tune and not tuned in

To break the unbreakable, escape the unescapable

'Til you push your fucking limits, you don't even know what's capable

Fuck that shit that you believe in, I believe in me

Talkin' on they phones and PC like they off that PCP

Bitch, I spit that Eazy-E, face to face, Smack DVD

I don't got no time for hanging out and all that E-T-C

Just cut the check, C-T-C, Godbody my physique

I can look inside your eyes and know exactly what you mean

Fuck you mean? Energy the first language that I speak

No facade, I belong in the Palace of Versailles with a queen by my side

In this hot girl summer, I'm just trying to find a wife

Visualizing from every island that's on Hawaii

With my team on each side, like ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

With the last laugh like Kawhi

And you know that you that one when you beat all the other odds

I keep one foot planted at home and the other one on a swivel though

Gotta keep 'em both 'cause this shit get way too pivotal

All the work is analog, all the payment digital

When tempers tend to flare up, I'm the one to be cool since preschool

I know which ones that's been rocking with me, dawg, since the prequel

Just be cool

I know your favorite one, dawg, I'm 'bout to drop the sequel

Nigga, this just the preview

Don



Strike to claim it, a strike to claim it

Goddammit, yes, that is why I did it

My, my, my, as the world turns
Today if I don't earn, best believe I'm gon' learn
If I can't do either or, shit it's none of my concern
Watch my enemies burn as I f-fill every urn, ah
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to

The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too

The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too

Niggas seven feet, telling me I'm who they look up to

Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up

Don't invite em to my shows but always still manage to show up

Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion

And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be voting

So when you step inside my office, treat that place like it's the Oval

El presidente, lord, sensei

Do ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting riskay

Crazy nigga, they ain't seen it like this since Ye, yea

Well this the life that I live

Collecting everything overdue, for all the work that I overdid

D-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I'm Oprah kid

Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist

Cause when you come from the bottom man it's so hard to get a glimpse

So hard to get a glimpse, so while I'm here I might take a pic

And show em that it's more to the world than tryna make a living

Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it

Okay, como me llamo

She say Ingles, no hablo, man unless it's eat me out though

Benihani, my McDonald, all black leather jackets

While I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I'm Keanu

Wishing Lamborghinis made of fire though

Cause I got too many real mufuckas I ride for, die for, uh

Straight out the metropolitan

My city need a hero so I treat it like Metropolis

And it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can name

Even though I'm me, Lord knows that I can't say

But I'm still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch

I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain't rich

Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man we ain't make shit

From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge

And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate

Man we was trying to get away, man we was trying to get our day

And damn (damn), tomorrow never seemed so close

And life ain't what it seem no mo' (no mo')

Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast

A million dollars never seemed so broke

And every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with

And niggas suing me and they just banking on the settlement

Never settling, life is too fast just to settle in

So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement like damn!



Shit, can't a young nigga live man

We done worked too hard

Yup, GOOD, Finally Famous nigga

We aint never going broke nigga!"

KeY Wane on the beat, you know that be my favorite BPM

Hol' up, fuck me over once, you never seein' me again

Fuck me over twice and I'm the last thing you see

Never thought I'd be investin' in restaurants with Hov

And see my movie theater downtown Detroit opening doors

Dawg, I seen niggas get buried in suits that never wore suits

That shit can get deep as my Nigerian roots

And I need therapy too, someone that care for me too

Someone who there for me to the point

When they not there, it still feel like they there for me too

My zone is not a comfort zone, you can't compare me to you

That's mastermind advice (Advice)

Livin' a life that's overpriced

Lookin' like I sold my soul, bought it back, then I sold it twice

No, just years in the makin'

Love makin' is the only thing happenin' overnight

Look, dawg, I been meditating on top of the mountain

So many lies spread about me, no point in respondin'

I realized that some stars live way above the comets

Million dollar deals on my iPhone, signature electronic

And my soul is solid (Solid)

And my heart bipolar ('Polar)

And I done flown in my zone like drones over the housing

Cut from a special cloth, reap what I'm sowing

Only following my soldiers and the homies

Watching myself like bitches talkin' to me, tell 'em watch they tone

And this is my atonement

Couldn't get this far without everybody help

When you number one that mean your back to everybody else

So I watch that shit

I rather pass the ball than to drop that shit

I seen egos sinking for the game, losing brick, look, he ain't winning shit

Prize's the last to thing to fall, advice is first of all

That's why I stay listening, like I stay hydrated

Phone and aura both vibrating

Vibe contagious, not complacent, tryna pace it

But me and my 'ponent are nonadjacent

And when you pay it forward, the rest of your life gon' feel like compensation

On the lake, I'm out of the state, at my hideaway

Like Bruce Wayne, I'm saving the day, and I'm getting bank

I'm foolay, my bitch got bootay, ooh I love the way

I woke up, my dough up, I got out, I go nuts

I show out, I blow up, I ball out, I po' up

Ok it's Early Mac off in this ho, tailor-made designer coat

Watch me take it to the bank and deposit a pot of gold

I'm fooling



(Hook: Sean and James)

I woke up

Boy it's time to get it

Walking to the window, saw the city

Thank God I woke up

Feeling like the mothafuckin' realest

Living but it's time to make a killing

Thank God I woke up"

Yea, you know what this is, nigga.
You know who this is. That's right, Young, nigga.
I'm like one of Detroit's own, you know.
I fuck with the D so much,'cause you know, it's a natural born place of hustlas.

You know, real niggas, money go gettas, against all odds, you know.

I remember the first time I came to the D for a show, you know what I'm sayin'.

Um, I hit the homies up, let 'em know I was in town.

I was sitting at the Atheneum, and mufuckin' um,

The show was over at the Zoo Bar, and nigga we walked - literally - 300 deep to the club, all black tees.

Matter of fact, we walked back from that mufucka, you know what I'm sayin'.

I went and did my show, repped out, you know what

I'm sayin', walked back to the hotel,

Hung out ,for a minute and niggas was like,

""Yo, let's hit the Sting,"" and I'm like, ""What the fuck is that?""

""It's like a strip club in the hood. That shit stay open every night.""

I'm like, ""Shit, that's right up my mufuckin' alley,"" you know.

But you know most of all, you know about the D,

I got mufuckin' niggas in the D that I really love and fuck with genuinely, nigga, as they fuck with me befo'.

You know, it was really rap shit.

You know when I was trappin' mixtapes, niggas in the D was fuckin' with me like

I was from 7 Mile or some shit, you know what I'm sayin'.

West Side, Southwest, for real. I was tellin' a nigga Sean,

I'm like, I said, ""Nigga, it ain't a lot of superstars in the D."" I was like,

""Nigga, they got you and Eminem, but other than that, nigga you know, they got street legends, nigga.

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right

And my family live that life

As I look up to the sky

Thought about a 100 things to do before I die

Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life

Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky

I thought about a 100 things to do before I die



(Verse :Big Sean)

Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type

Same shit different nights, till I live a different life

Sean you looking tired, damn homie that's all

I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I ain't going bald

Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms

Take online classes and turn back into ya'll, hatin'

I guess they want your lights out when you the plug

Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug

From where they move the drugs, Buddha love

Niggas sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkin' bout computer love

All the wrong people you a price tag

Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag

Make it where I'm from, stay who I become

Time to raise hell, say nay my son

Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view

And have the fam there too

If I just stop breathin', even though I got all this muthafuckin' money

Won't keep my heart beatin'

Just don't let me die

Cocaine rush, I'm speedin'

(Verse : Royce Da 5'9"")

I'm just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me

I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me

I strive for perfection at the same time

I'm accepting the fact that there'll never be nothing perfect about me

Shit, I'm just waiting on a win

Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin

We are 6 mile bred, thats why you see our sick style yeah

Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs

Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me

The baddest chick is yonking, imagine this yapping at me

5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon

Now I'm Cali swaggin'

My nigga listen, I'm over the fame

You number 1, I'm nr 23, my mission is take over the game

You rollin' with lames, we ain't rollin' the same

I'm the best out in this muthafucker

If I could get a check out of this muthafucka big enough to set my kids up for life

I could check out of this muthafucka, with no regrets

If you ain't living your life for ya kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect

I gotta break ya fuckin' heart

I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb)

I gotta do something that's innovative

Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part

I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma

Breakfast in bed with plenty of Carne Asada (I gotta)

I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta)

I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise

I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive

But those who lied to the minority will make em turn inside they grave

I can easily pretend like yall, but thats not me

I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth

Need to know every detail about this Earth, the devil controls it

So before you scrutinise how I feel ask God if those polls important

The end is near!

Welcome to Hell's paradise
I always heard life was a pair of dice
Seven, eleven, or a pair of eyes

As I'm looking at her smearing eyes

She yelling take them glasses off your eyes are the only things that not lying

Not caring to the point that I stopped lying

I tell her I feel the same

She tell me nigga quit playing you the only one that's not crying

You said you wasn't on no steal your man shit

If I broke it off now we won't be on some friend shit

Man, what goes around comes around like some ceiling fan shit

I broke the levy to your eyes

That I don't give a damn shit



(Hook: Chris Brown)

Another time, another time, it's the same old shit

It might be to late, for me to learn from my mistakes

I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you

But you should have used your head first

This might be the biggest mistake, it's too late

Cause two can't be in first place



(Verse 2)

Wake up then, Call your ex and make up then

What was no strings attached got tangled when

Fun stopped being fun, and feeling tried to finagle in

We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in

Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one

You need a good guy, and I'm already not one

She said we lost a kid already, I'm already not that young

My biological clock is ticking, I'm not just trying to have fun

Shits way different from us first chilling

Sometimes last words can have the worst ending

Which we could fast forward time and reverse feelings

Is there a warranty for love to return or fix it

She said you good either way, when it was her last night nigga and me today

You the man, Huh? Getting on the TNA

You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA?

And so on and so on, And the shit just always goes on

Nothing about us feeling right

But she'll be back before the end of the night



(Hook: Chris Brown)

Another time, another time, it's the same old shit

It might be to late, for me to learn from my mistakes

I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you

I aim for the sky, never landed

Hmm, and look at all these mother fuckers trynna get rich off me

But they wasn't there not when times got heavy man when things got deadly

Coming from a city where dreams get shredded, I'm goin off credit, these niggas need debit

Made mistakes but they made me what I am and I am what I am and I don't regret it

And I found the girl that I'd marry, the only curse

Is that I keep running into the girls that I'd fuck first

Before it's all said and done the one thing that I gotta say is



(Hook)

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say

There's no turning back now

There's no turning back now

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say

There's no turning back now

There's no turning back now



(Verse 2: Big Sean)

Man I miss my grandma

She ain't passed away or nothin, I'm just busy on camera

I love her, I love her, I should call her up and tell her

Give her some flowers, while she can still smell em

While she can still smell 'em, if you love somebody please tell 'em

I swear if you had 24 hours, tell me who or what would you do?

Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get it high with your crew?

Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?

Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?

Would you, try and make the news?

Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues?

Would you step it up or would you try and trade shoes?

Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?

Would you, hit the bar and go binging?

Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and

Would you die alone, would you die independent?

Or would have your friends right there in attendance when it's all finished?

Guess that depends on how you live

Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did



(Bridge)

But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs

For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?

Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?

I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?

Would you trade it all?

For everything you know, are you down to let it go?



(Hook)

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say

There's no turning back now

There's no turning back now

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say

There's no turning back now

There's no turning back now"

(Verse 1: Big Sean)
From the West but I'm heading to the Northside
That's the top, I need a crib on the shoreside
I need a backyard full court size

From where the judge is the only thing that's courtside

Chasing money in the city of crime

Cash back so then it's black bags under my eyes

Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep

To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats

Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone

They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!

I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on

Mama had 2 jobs I know that she was working for me

Ten years later, I got her working for me

Hired the whole family like mobsters

Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors

Grandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city

Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy

London or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney

Paris, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' yup!

Texas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy

All the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me

Heading to the money, whole city coming with me

And I'mma rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!



(Hook)

And this is how life should go

Everything I wanted never seem so close

Good people, good drinks, good smoke

Got me thinking this is how life should go

This is how life should go

Everything I wanted never seem so close

Family all around, all highs no lows

Got me thinking this is how life should go



(Verse 2: Wale)

Sitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher

I keep it funky with my misses, fuck these other bitches

And this ain't biblical but this sermon is spiritual

Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few

The upper percentile

Whipping whatever I, 460LS you

I probably go less miles, stay in a small circle

Know that it's God working

Police got the swine flu and these niggas is reptiles

Yeah, Maybach poetic genius

You buying a seventines, keep mine in a seven Beemer

I'm trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it

A fly nigga, I keep having the gravity grievous

And while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features

That's like a complacent atheist is asking for Jesus

Riding around without a fuck given

Behind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten

The best in my position, I'm passionate with lyrics

And they ain't fucking with the kid like Chris Hansen in the kitchen

I'm handsome to these women, I'm envied by these no ones

That's no Joakim Noah, nigga everybody know us

And even if you don't drink everybody po' up

Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon' show up

Never hate on no one, your blessing's getting closer

Even when I'm open, it's nothing to Ed Cota wassup



(Hook)

And this is how life should go

Everything I wanted never seem so close

Good people, good drinks, good smoke

Got me thinking this is how life should go

This is how life should go

Everything I wanted never seem so close

Family all around, all highs no lows

Got me thinking this is how life should go"

(Verse 1: Sean)
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception

In this cold world, it's all about collection

So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto

Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world

I made a promise to the mirror

That I'd, never ever ever go broke

Riding through the city, I be riding through the city

All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though

Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

So I'mma drink and smoke and fuck and go go go

(Verse 2: Wiz)

While I'm flying over Italy, flying over cities

Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though

My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana

I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know

I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now

No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints

Seen the how-to video now he on point

And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one

If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none

Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some

And there's only one, you know you know

Khalifa got, I stay high like Pluto



(Verse 3: Sean)

Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)

I'm going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)

I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue

I just hold money, don't hold me up

Rolling in more green than a hole in one

You got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'

See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be

But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me

I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef

I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck

I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex

I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex

Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG

Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee

This what they been waiting on?
Critical, ain't no time left on the clock
When it's your time, give 'em something to watch
I picked all the locks 'til I buy out the block
And I know I'm a gift but I think out the box



And they want me to stop but why would I stop?

Huh? I am unstoppable

Hold up, why would I stop?

Bitch, why would I stop?

Chill (Chill)

I don't jump, I dive in it

Hold up, hold up, hold up

This the reason I'm alive, ain't it?



This shit the antidote, this the cure cancer flow

Stop a pandemic and the globe

The product of old 'Ye chopping up the sample flow

Dilla and Pimp C, the triller

This shit might go too trill for Triller though (Woah)

I see you critical, I'm the hospitable

Favorite rappers, I done cut they umbilicals (Cut)

Rеd Wings jersey B.I.G., look like Pac

Thе blacker the berry, more they wan' see it rot (Rot)

I'm going down as one of the gods

G-O-D D-O-A, dead or alive

I'm laying low, they could be espionage

This ain't no walk in the park, you can't slide

Solution to everyone one else 'round me problems

Next episode, got the whole fucking world watching

I might leave the series, come back like I'm Robin

Getting that all right now my only two options



So why would I stop?

I am unstoppable

Hold up, why would I stop?

Bitch, this shit unstoppable

Chill (Chill)

I don't jump, I dive in it

Hold up, hold up, hold up

This the reason I'm alive, ain't it?



The DJ gon' drop this, we made it from scratch

I'm mindin' my business and all of it's black

My dawg on the same way, the mode is attack

I don't complain about life, I adapt

I'm at the point if I fuck with a lil' ho

It's not a just a fling, it's a scandal (On God)

I can't be handin' out samples (No way)

I can't be havin' ten baby mamas

That shit sound like a job, not a family (Straight up)

And I do this shit for the family (Straight up)

Yeah, that's just the roots how I planned it (On God)

D2, this shit the new standard (Grr)

Upgraded the city, it got a new feeling

The house that I built (Woah, woah, woah)

House in the hills

Ain't no hills in the D so we all in the field (Woah, woah)

Running shit, five K, three K, Andre (Run it, run it, run it)

Hero in my hood, when they dress like me, that's cosplay

Give a fuck 'bout a threat, nigga

I'm a threat leaving out the driveway (Swerve-swerve-swerve-swerve)

I never listen to what the odds say

Why when the universe would ponder what I say

(I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say)

If they want my spot, then they gotta come for me
Just know I want this shit more than whatever it is you want from me
And the only thought at night that comforts me is starvin' whoever's huntin' me
Shit, lucky me, to be rich in a world where nothing's free
And separated from hell by one degree

Surrounded by niggas who did first degree

And the other ones that never got they first degree, sheesh

Lucky me (Nigga!)

Yeah, I done slashed hoes like I'm Slash on some rock star shit

Even bought Slash old crib, that's rock star as it gets

And have my hands on the R&B legends you couldn't handle

Whether you do music or not, you wish you could sample

And I had to live through the scandals

Public humiliations and breakups on camera

It's a living nightmare when your dream girl has to get canceled

And you gotta delete all the photos and shit like you never Instagrammed it

And you get off-track but somehow you gotta stay transit

Man, lucky me

I was diagnosed with a heart disease at 19

Could barely stand on my feet

Doctors said they had to cut it open, put a pacemaker on it to put it back on beat

'Til my mama took me to holistic doctors and they prescribed me magnesium for two weeks

Went back to the regular doctors and they said, ""Huh, damn, looks like we don't need to proceed""

That's how I know that western medicine weak

Man, lucky me, to be the chosen one

And saved for the special occasions like I was Opus One

You know, and I'ma live forever like Walt Disney, the frozen one

Done flew so many times past the limit, I didn't even know it was one

And face our problems head-on when they told us to run

And ran it up in a city where no one would come

When I had literally died but then came back alive

And it's the furthest thing that I know from over and done

And I don't even have to say it, you know where I'm from, bitch (Yeah, yeah)

Lucky me, lucky who? (Lucky) Lucky, true

It's a wonder what prayer, working smart and love can do

And y'all got an efficient and humble crew

And you got a long list of the things y'all wanna do

Shit, who knows, lucky me can turn into lucky you

We turned nothing to something so much it's nothing new

I know lady luck so well, I swear that's like my bottom bitch, number two

Doing what we love and choose with lots to lose and more to prove

Ain't running from nothing but haven't lost sight of the finish line that we been runnin' to

Lil' bitch, this Detroit-fucking-2

My thoughts is all-black, yeah, I'm back to the roots

Fuck your white flag, ho, I don't want no truce

And we all in the huddle, they like, ""It's on you""

Hm, lucky me (Me), pressure's what I eat

Ain't no roses at my feet, just the blood on the concrete, look (Hit-Boy on the beat, so bitch you gotta go berserk)



The mission is covert

I stuck to the code and you don't know the code word

Once they start me up then just know that it's over (Woah, woah)

My soul is on solace, surrounded by angels and soldiers on soldiers

World turned me cold, game turned me colder

Sittin' courtside lookin' like I'm finna be the fuckin' future owner (Woah)

Cup runneth over and she comin' over (Woah)

And she told me that her lil' bro wanna be me when he older (That's facts)



Look, I ain't gon' hold you, though

Put in my family, I feel like Utopia

Falling in love with a slut is my phobia

My whole team first class, so it ain't no coachin' us



Woah there, don't go there, now slow down lil' brodie

I know you don't know me

I'm buffed up, my chest up, I feel like Hulk Hogan

I walk in the building like everybody owe me

Move heaven on Earth, this shit feel like erosion

The Don, I'm the king, I'm consultin' the soldiers

You talk to me nice and not real, I'm insulted

I bet on myself, ain't no way my hand's folding

What's a limitation? Fuck your validation

I don't got a figure, God flow, got it renovated

Demon slayer and my bitch slayin', legendary, it's insinuated

Two guards outside barricaded while I'm serenadin' (Yeah)

Paradise covin' while I'm stroking

Pussy tight, I'm claustrophobic

She so damn down and devoted

Got me wondering what's her motives (What's her—)

Remember my feelings don't mean shit to none of my goals, so I gotta stay focused

The city is soulless, this shit get too vulgar

Seen bodies wrapped up in them white sheets, no COVID



The mission is covert

I stuck to the code and you don't know the code word

Once they start me up then just know that it's over (Woah, woah)

My soul is on solace, surrounded by angels and soldiers on soldiers

Nobody over us, 'cept the ones we lost that stay watchin' over us (Amen)

Prayin' (Love you guys so much), prayin' (Yeah)

Say ""Amen"" (Yeah), I'm lucky

G. Ry got me
Look
Fuck rap, I'm a street legend, block love me with a deep reverence
I was birthed in a C-section

Hella cops and police presence, we got opps so we keep weapons

We on y'all block while y'all eat breakfast

A lot of shots, we broke street records

Watch how you talk, I got reflexes, watchin' your cheap necklace

Then we slide out the East exit

But every time we get to fuckin' niggas up, TMZ catch it

Yeah, I still learn the street lessons

From the mastermind, first you master grind, then your team catch it

This time is for the money, I don't need credit

But I'm the don 'cause the streets said it, look



Fuck rap, I'm a street legend

But I'm the don 'cause the streets said it

Block love me with a deep reverence (Yeah, woah)

But I'm the don 'cause the streets said it (Yeah)



And I got pressure on me

Seven days a week, it's game seven on me

Life'll test you out, you live through that, that's testimony

Givin' them hell, but how in the hell I got all these blessings on me?

Most of the girls I know addicted to social media

All the time they put in, they could've wrote encyclopedias

Mama said it only takes one time to fuck up your whole Wikipedia

And as your son, I can see the type of light that you see me in

After what happened to Nipsey, I reached out to Kendrick

It wasn't even no real issues there to begin with

Lack of communication and wrong information

From people fueled by their ego, it's like mixin' flames with diesel

Energy crazy, I realized that it's a two-way street

What's comin' is goin', if it don't give you more, it drains you

Should be a billionaire based on the time off I'm not takin'

Probably why the shit with me get crazy and we lost a baby

And everybody around me think I'm the one

But we all just one of ones

And I'm walkin' out the crib, they ask me where I'm goin'

I told them, ""I'm goin on another ten year run""

Niggas is bangin' over blocks that they don't own, thinkin' that's home

Boy, you think that's where you from? You don't really know where you from

You don't how deep your roots is or what your ancestors had done

So, God bless all of the sons and daughters

Who knew they histories so they knew where to take it farther

And all the ones that stuck with me like good barbers

Lookin' at my life story, God's a good author

Never was the loudest in the room, we move like ninjas

And if it cost your peace of mind, it might be too expensive

So I can't give you everything that you want from me for free though

Get you one shot in life, you might not be able to reload

So advanced, I need all my advances

Bro hit me up for cash like we didn't have the same chances

My dad hit me up like, ""Why I don't live in a mansion?""

I'm tryna focus, but baby girl keep holdin' my mind for ransom

And that ain't how it supposed to be, this man Hov got to a B

And his name Shawn too, I almost felt like it was me

Damn, I realized all my setbacks were inside of me

In high school I learned chemistry, biology

But not how to cope with anxiety

Or how I could feel like I'm by myself on an island with depression on all sides of me (Damn)

With a Glock .17 right on the side of me (Hol' up)

Look, I ain't think I had the thought of suicide in me

Until life showed me all these different sides of me

Too many times I thought the reaper was outside for me

And how the fuck it's people that never met me that hate me?

I wonder if they understand that I meditate daily

And feel like my life purpose is to give inspiration

Despite the hit songs that there's just no escapin'

That I take care of my family and beat the odds that were deadly

You hate that, that just reflects your lack of succession, bless 'em

If it ain't Nipsey blue, it's Detroit blue

This that Detroit 2, I'm bringin' it back to the hood like D-Boys do

Gone



So, the collaboration though, with Nipsey and who?

Aw man, I'd probably say Payroll, look, or Tee Grizzley

Me and Big Sean talked about doin' somethin' recently, too

So, you know, all of them, I'ma, I'ma tap in with all of Detroit

Fuck rap, I'm a street legend

Block love me with a deep reverence"

5rtUKt6YbKTBb8hVIbsMsv,Story By Dave Chappelle,6slkiHeFK3wW2D1mao0TX3,Detroit 2,0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh,Big Sean,155166,,2020,"There's never been a single time
Not a, not a-one, that I've ever been to Detroit
Where it wasn't some kind of adventure
City is fucking crazy, it's like, it's palpably alive
It's an entity, it's not like just a place you go
It's Detroit

And one of the reasons that Detroit is my favorite market

Is because the audiences in Detroit, for a comedian

I find them to be particularly challenging

So when I go there, in this particular story

It seemed likе a pretty benign night

And I'm sittin' in the drеssing room at the Fillmore

And there's an older gentleman in there

And I don't really talk to the guy much, but he was a nice guy

Cool energy, shit like that

And then, famed Detroit rapper Danny Brown came in

Now this time, I wasn't that familiar with Danny Brown's music

You know what I mean?

So when he asked me to smoke with him, I just smoked with him

I didn't hear all that ""Adderall! Adderall!"" and all that shit

I didn't know he was about that life (Haha)

I'm assuming it's weed, I don't know what the fuck it was

But, boy, I mean, I smoked weed a million times in my life

Never, ever remember feeling this way any before

And as I was walking on stage, I told my road manager

""You know, my number's up tonight""

He said, ""What does that mean?""

I'm going to bomb

And true to my professional prescription, I did

But, there's bombing in there and there's shit that happens in Detroit

It's like, the crowd was with me

But the way the crowd responded to me widely

Was one of my favorite crowd interactions ever

And as the set is going terribly

When it's clear I'm not gonna be able to pull the nose up and I'm gonna have to crash this thing

I saw Danny Brown slipping out the room, which made me laugh really hard

Go back in dressing room and everyone, you know there's a stink on ya after you bomb

Where everyone looks at you like, you know what I mean?

Like Headwound Harry, like, ""Nigga, are you okay?""

But I really, I can't explain it to ya, I really didn't care

And then, and then, it turns out

That this kind older gentleman, is Big Sean's father

And my goodness what the, the, he gave me a pep talk that only a dad could give

And it made me feel wonderful, man (Wow)

So shoutout to you Big Sean, shout out to Detroit

I'll never stop loving your city, and I'll never stop loving you, bro

You guys are the truth, much love to the Motor City"

Woah, woah, woah
I know we gon' make it if Mike WiLL Made-It, yeah
New tags, toe tags (Woah, woah)
No more breaks, dawg, it's time to break hearts (Break hearts)

I don't take disrespect, I take charge (Woah)

I'm in the mirror lookin' at a work of art (Like, God)

Hard work don’t mean shit if it ain't smart (Ain't smart, ooh)

I'ma run the play up to the max (Like that)

So if I don't know you, don't owe you, I gotta tax (Woah, woah)

I got enough sense, and I slipped through the cracks (Woah)

And, nowadays, I wear my smile like a mask

I'm the idols I looked up to in my past

All natural, Doctor Sebi, you gon' have to CBD me

I been watchin' what they feed mе (Woah, woah)

I like when she tеll me with her body language that she need me (Yeah)

See my third eye is on left eye, I can't let them Eazy-E me

No sir (Sir), Ion’t even do flu shots

Clique with me everywhere I go, so every pic a group shot (Shot)

I done wiggled out the noose knot (Damn)

They been lyin' to me my whole life, I finally found the truth out (God)

Like they don't gotta love you if they need you (Woah)

Got angels and demons on a three-way (Woah)

And they ain’t comin' to no agreement

And I still be feelin' broke again, if I'm gettin' money

And my team ain't gettin' cream until we cremate (Whew)

Big headlines, I'm talkin' CNN (CNN, woah)

I see a hatin' bitch like, ""Hi, it’s me again"" (Me again, woah)

They like ""Why you feel so good?"" (Man)

I'm like ""Why I need a reason?"" (Straight up, straight up, straight up)

Lot of salt, lot of shade bein' thrown my way, man

I guess it's just a season (Damn, throw it)



But I gotta thank God though

'Cause he got me workin' harder than my demons (Woah, woah)

God got me workin' harder than my demons (Woah)

God got me workin' harder than my, hol' up

God got me workin' harder than my demons

God got me workin' harder than my demons

God got me workin' harder than my-



Luther Vandross, never too much (Too much)

Now we two up, who, us?

Yeah, real ones learn the work through us (Through)

Baby girl wanna dance, wanna groove, wanna vibe

But you know my best move is the one where you end up on my side

The ground on the mountain top feel the same as rock-bottom (Bottom)

Quit my fuckin' job, that’s when the real work started

Still showed up every mornin', every evenin' of every season (Straight up, woah)

What's the reason? God got me workin' harder than my-



Demon (Mmm)

Harder than my demons (Demons, harder than my demons)

Harder than my demons, demons, demons, demons

I been fightin' every season

Harder than my demons"

That shit is in you
You ain't gotta try that hard
I just want you to know that
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh-oh)

There’s no romancin' without the pain

Just like there's no loss without some gain

Just like there’s no day without a blessin'

Just like no paydays without finessin'

But when who hurt you's forgiven

And all the late nights you been wishin' (Finally pay off)

Finally pay off and go the distance

I pray you get everything you missin'



Everything you missin', dawg

I pray you get everything you missin'

Everything you missin’

I pray you get everything you missin’

(Oh-oh, oh)



I'm ’bout to delete my Twitter and follow my intuition

Been in and out the mud, but somеhow I'm in mint condition

I wonder if Granddad would have seen thesе Instagram vixens

Every fifteen minutes, but he outdid everything that he did or he didn't

I wonder how it feel to be rappin'

Swear that’s my fuckin' passion, how it feel to go platinum?

Swear that's my dream, but he too blind to see that

If he doin' what he love in his freetime, then his dream already happened

It's not about the trophy, it's about what it took to grab it

And if you feelin' stagnant, just know you attractin' the energy

That you put out there, you a walkin' magnet

Life can be a struggle, but what isn't that's worth havin'? Huh?



There's no romancin' without the pain

Just like there's no loss without some gain

Just like there's no day without a blessin'

Just like no paydays without finessin'

But when who hurt you's forgiven

And all the late nights you been wishin'

Finally pay off and go the distance

I pray you get everything you missin'



Everything you missin', dawg

I pray you get everything you missin'

Everything you missin'



New life start with a blank canvas

Tryna find yourself, you moved to Lost Angeles

Where the camera's off, you're still not off camera

And that meeting that's supposed to change your life keep getting canceled

Swear my prayers gon' get answered 'fore these execs'll answer

Shit, expenses get too expensive

But you gon' do what it takes to do the digits

Even do the dishes

'Cause you gotta prove to the world how you committed

You got a whole city to inspire

It's so cold in the D, so through they eyes, you on fire

Going platinum once like catching lightning in a bottle

But you do it fifty times

And you realize contracts say a lot between the lines

But through the ups and downs, you make a blueprint that the city can build they own way out

And when they do, it's gon' feel like that you almost did it

And you buy everything you want, but it barely make you different

And find out random bitches can't even compare to commitment

And you learn hearin' doubts doesn't mean you have to listen

And you can't believe how much you made, not money, a difference

And find out everything you had was everything you missin'"

It's 'cause I'm from D, the other D
But Detroit had a special place in my heart
Creative, deep, rooted, organic, cosmic
Fantastic, futuristic, ancient, musical

When I think of Detroit, I think of these things

There's something in that dirty water that gives it its flavor

There's an invisible intelligence that runs through the streets

Like an underground rooting system

Millions and billions of memories of atoms of all of the beautiful music that has been created there

And I've seen it еvolve into, thangs only felt in the hеart

I know this to be true

Thank you, Berry Gordy, for that little house

Thank you, Stevie Wonder, for always calling me and reminding me that it is there

That thang

I always long to reconnect with it when I lose my way musically

Thank you, J Dilla, for your peculiar, peculiar intelligence

Yeah, Detroit just has a magic and I know it to be true

I wonder if my karma's up and this is my last life to get it right

The days are getting shorter, I noticed

Seems like time is moving fast forward while I'm in slow motion (Slow)

Losing loved ones with really no one to cope with

It's cool, my third and my fourth eye open, damn

(Thank you, God, so much)

I dodged a cell, but still locked on the cell

I never thought I'd see the day my mom wouldn't agree with Oprah and Gayle

Myra Denise was my peace, a heaven on earth and living hell

Who gave me everything, but never took anything for herself

Imagine '06 Impala with zero mileage

Seventeen, baggy clothes, not like Billie Eilish

Some niggas grow old but not up, they still as childish

Demons wearin' mask as my friends, they favorite disguises (Woah)

But niggas not gon' forget about me like niggas forgot 'bout how

Harriet was supposed to be on top of that twenty dollars (Straight up)

Dawg, my life a scene out of Casablanca, you got it wrong, I'm the monster

Burning Man, Ayahuasca (Burning), my check on no diagnostics (Woo)

'Cept tonight we in Houston, the next night is Chattanooga (Oh)

But it's still Latins that's rappin' to it (Oh)

Pursuit of happiness, I had to prove it

The best part 'bout problems is problems all come with solutions

That's why I don't focus on no legacy shit

All I care about is pluggin' friends and fam, that's it (That's it)

And being the missing link to all their goals and dreams, that's it

And sinkin' the winning shot while I'm triple teamed for the chip, bitch



And I'ma let my whole soul glow

I can't kick it with you no more, can't miss no more goals

Best linens and my bitch sound like she Yoko Ono

When the reaper say it's time to go, I'ma say, ""No, no, no""

Run home and go fuck my room up

These streets will try to vacuum you up

I don't think it would be logic to say that I'm retirin'

But I should say bye-bye, earthlings

'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this ""Grindin'"" beat, yeah

I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song

You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart

So when I'm rippin', it's hard to tell whether if it is really because

Of how offensive I am, or just what a bitch that you are

Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul

Like I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and I'm quick on the draw

Yeah, so when I pull it, surprise like Kendrick Lamar

You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog

'Cause y'all are missing a heart

Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz

This shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping

Y'all got detention tomorrow

I'm severe like Benzo withdrawal

Bitch, your skin's gonna crawl

I'm invincible, I've been through it all

Like I never thought about just ending it 'til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall

My back was against

Now I rap like I'm possessed, that's nine-tenths of the law

Oh

Oh, fuck it"
4ZrKeaqGjiC2GeFBia8q9Z,Story By Stevie Wonder,6slkiHeFK3wW2D1mao0TX3,Detroit 2,0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh,Big Sean,133882,,2020,"Hey, this is Stevie
I was blessed to be raised in the west side of Detroit
I lived on Breckenridge, that was the first home that we lived in
My neighborhood, where I was raised up
When the girls came around, I would sing
On the front porch, beating on the stairs and singing

For hours and hours upon hours

Seeing a piano for the first time

But the amazing thing as well is

Through those experiences, I was able to understand how

My being blind because my mother allowed me to be free

Didn't mean that I had to be blind to the world

I may have had a visual disability

But did not stop my vision inside me

I didn't know what it was like being poor

Because God had made me rich

Even before I was born

Rich with the spirit of knowing that

Anything you imagine that's for the good is possible to be a reality

Because a few weeks before I was discovered, I

I had a dream that I heard my music, my record on the radio

I had nothing out, no one knew who I was, and, um

Amazing, it really happened

And so you know, it's just, it's...

I, I, I can say to other young people as I said to my son Kiland

I said, ""Listen, what you don't understand

Is that God gave you a brand even before you were born

All you had to do in life is walk into it"""

What about that part (Two)
Ayy, yeah
Talk your shit, what? Ayy
Look at all the souls I saved
Look at all the O's I made (Woah)

Same outfit, a couple days (Yeah)

Listen to Big Sean (Okay praise, nigga)



This for my baby who comin' over to buss it open (Buss it)

Who get an Uber but really deserve a dozen roses (Damn)

Who got her hair done and didn't think I even noticed

She just happy she chosen

But she the one who chose me, that's what's more important (Woah)

I give her more game than problems, she love how I coach her

Under unrealistic measures is the only way you can measure who's chosen

I realized my mind frame is too big for the portrait

That's why I'm steady tryna teach the whole hood corporate

Off psychedelics while a physic tryna read my fortune

But I know knowing too much of anything can be a torture (Yeah)

She like, ""You supposed to meet my parents, you know that's important""

How narcissistic you think I am? Huh?

You think I did when I didn't (What?)

You think I paid for everything and didn't pay attention

Like my head is as big as my name (Come on)

Just tell a real nigga once, baby, never again (Swerve)

And I'll put you and all my loved ones on like it's my only obligation

I made all they solid wins a loud proclamation

A little pressure and a lot of patience

They tell me you amazing, I say no, God amazing



Look at all the souls I saved (Straight up)

Look at all the O's I made (Yeah)

Same outfit a couple of days (What about that part?)

Listen to Big Sean (Okay, praise)



But just remember it's easier for mothafuckas to count you out than it is to count you in

So you gotta understand if they don't see where you comin' from or if they small-minded

And not thinking that it's enough for all of us to get it

That's why it's important to be your own boss

To some capacity you know, put yourself in control

Through the ups and downs, wins and losses, they all just chapters

Chapters in your life story and really

Some losses teach you how to win you know

Some losses teach you more than always winning ever could (Yeah, ayy)

And I been there back against the ropes, against the wall

(I ain't tryna waste nobody time, don't waste mine)

That's just 'cause you the one that can handle it, you know?

Shit man, you gotta prove yourself

You gotta rise the fuck up (Up)

Show 'em who you are, man (Yeah)

You ain't gonna give me a way? Okay, cool

I'ma make a way, you feel me?

(Look at all these roads I paved, nigga)

Ain't no mistakes, ain't no regrets

Regrets only there 'cause you ain't learned your lesson (All the times I ain't cave)

Or forgave yourself, either or (Yeah, ayy)

Yeah (All we do is elevate), elevate

(Big Sean) And I'm just gonna leave it right here

Turn my phone off 'cause I got a higher calling

Keep my girls on rose petals, keep runnin' into the devil

Beat his ass every time, next time I'ma bring a shovel

To put his ass in the dirt and then laugh 'til it hurt

I put that work in overnight like that shit due today

I paint the pictures they can't trace try and you get erased

I'm less focused on props and more on property

They put so much back on my hood that I changed the economy

And help provide the heart of the city just keep on watching me

If these bitch ass niggas got they wish and stopping me

Just know I done done so much good business in my life

So many people wanna see my insides outsides

Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders

Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch

Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch

Where if they know you brown, they might hold you down

And even hose you down, man

Since I'm a son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard

I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card

And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings

And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

So when they take the fame, take the crib

Take our cars, now we gotta take the train

Hood niggas takin' chains, slave master take our names

5-0 take the shot and young souls take the blame

Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread? Gotta break it
Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking

Everything lined up for the taking

And what I need from 'em?

No favors, no favors

What I need? No favors

Everything lined up for the taking

And what I need from 'em? No favors



I'm about getting the job done, boy up every night

I'm about rolling a seven, when I toss up the dice

I'm about getting my logo off, flooded with ice

I'm about taking a risk, that might fuck up your life

Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews

In front of cameras too (brrr)

Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?

I'm like ""niggas took the flow but I'm still standing too""

Thought I had the Midas touch and then I went platinum too

Mother fuck all your comparisons

I've been talking to God like that's my therapist

I'm African-American in America

I ain't inherit shit but a millionaire under 30

So He must be hearing shit

Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib

The D to Flint who get sick with lead

Others get the hit with the laugh

From where they need a handout

But they tell you put hands up

Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club

Now it's blue blood in my veins, so you know where I came from

Born in a world going where they told me I can't go

In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt

Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for

When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel

Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles

Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies

That's my new lifetime policy

Wood grain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship

How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging

The pictures we been painting, my nigga

Connected to a higher power

How I know? 'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga

Look, all I ever did was beat the odds

Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out

Never stopping like we hypnotized

Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the G.O.A.T

While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods



Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it

You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it

Everything lined up for the taking

And what I need from em? No favors

Clique too big, bread? gotta break it

'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking

Everything lined up for the taking

And what I need from 'em?

No favors, no favors



If she was flavor I won't savor

No taste buds, hoe later

Fuck you looking at, hater?

I saw them eyes like an ass raper

Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate

I'll be the last face you see before you pass

When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper

So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing

I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy

Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty

Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy

They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis

Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater

A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos

It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy

But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81

Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap

State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks

Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving

Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey

Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it

Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it

Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous

Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth

Like a missile, a thunder cloud

100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound

And you'll get a round like Digital Underground

And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster

With a lamp post, door handle shutter

A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber

Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter

A banjo and manhole cover

Hand over the mouth and nose smother

Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover

The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner

Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her

That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando

Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn

I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando

Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch

I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)

And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A., white Bronco like Elway

Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?

Females stay beatin em, bet you they'll lay bleeding

And yell, ""Wait!"", pleadingbut screaming is pointless

Like feeding Michel'le helium

Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt

Straight treating 'em like a cell mate

See me I'm climbing hell's gate

Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made

Meaning someone else's help ain't needed

Cause I'ma [?]



Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it

You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it

Everything lined up for the taking

And what I need from em; no favors

Clique too big, bread? gotta break it

'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking

Everything lined up for the taking

And what I need from 'em?

No favors, no favors

What I need? No favors

Everything lined up for the taking

And what I need from 'em? no favors



(I know you feeling yourself right now

But I'm not sure she's the one

I would call them in)""Hey, I'm outside""

What are you doing here?"

Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill

It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill.

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type but you oughta know, oughta know

It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though

Forever letting them taste what's mine

Taste what's mine

Taste what's mine

You so fucking outta line



Feel like you owe me checks

Owe me time, owe me sex

Long nights, no reply

I don't got no regrets, you disrespect

Disrespect only time I seen you now is on the internet

Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to

I hit you back when I decide to

You got my tattoo, we was tribal

Then you left and we turned rivals

Now you back, it's our revival

They don't make you feel like I do

They didn't make you perform for me

You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic

Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku

Seems like all you got is hate for me

All you ever did was take from me

'Cause you know you got that walk from me

How you dress and how you talk from me

Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya

It took us being over to see all I did for ya

Damn



All that shit you told me, I believed

I'm just trying to let the past pass

Ain't no future in that, yeah

I stay 100 like my dash, yeah

Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah

Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask

Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass

Honestly I had to take the time to let my ego go

Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go

This don't replace what you did to me

This don't replace what I did to you

Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do

It's about what we getting through

Look, I'm not tryna play no blame game

Pointing fingers while we skip the point

Knowing that we both on the same thing

Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes

If we don't work it out, shame shame

I can't touch these hoes I can't trust

I don't wanna have a fake us



But all that shit you told me, I believed

The smile on your face the only thing I can't read

Forever letting them taste what's mine

Taste what's mine

Taste what's mine

You so fucking outta line



My friends say I should be over you

Getting hurt every time I'm close to you

I think me and you are overdue

I think this is what we supposed to do

I don't even know no more

Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary

Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy

I realized when it comes to girls

That chemistry means way more than anatomy

She mad at me, she been mad at me



I'm the livin' proof that you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece

People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed

My daddy tell me, ""Stay strong, son and be the man you have to be

Holdin' shit down, don't crash at sea""

Brrrr Paper on my phone line

It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me

But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically

'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually

So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me

And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now

So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me

Don't ask for me, don't ask for me

Don't ask for me

On a roll more than a roller coaster

They can't throw me off track or slow

If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes

I quote unquote say I told you so

Heaven on earth, every night is paradise

I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that

I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s

Still smokin' that 520 like it's 420

On a quest for more money, more hungry

Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'

Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'

Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'

In my city I'm Warren Buffett, I mean business, the shirt is tucked in

The gun's tucked in, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with

Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with

My stock's risin', I'm goin' public

If I write it, it's gon' publish

Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah



This the feeling know that I've'm missing some days

This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way

This feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday

With Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake

Or this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man

This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam

Pink Tim's, in the Lamb

Mixing it in with Dilla and

Headphones to the ceiling fan

Bucket hat like Gilligan, yeah

Lately I've been talking to ghosts

Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most

You know I still rep you when you're gone though

I got a picture of us on the front lawn

With me, grandma and mom, that night I went off to prom

Wishin' you could see that lysol dijon and parmesan

Funny thing about it is you always act like you knew

You told me how you were feeling before it happened, before it do

And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through

And you and grandma went broke so we would never get bruised

You the reason I ever touched my first Franklin

Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin

It reminded me how of we always used to dress up as a family

And go to Sunday service, and being in church, singin'

Ain't been to church in awhile

But it ain't just about how you just praise him in the building

It's about how you praisin' him while you out

You taught me to remember that when I get set back

Been through the worst times to get the best back

Wishin' for a time machine to jet back

'Til my all time low and something throw me a jetpack

And see you again, needless to say

Back when I dated Alisha, Simone

Or any other girl who looked like Lisa Bonet

Who was jealous of me and Jhené

Who you would always advise with me being away

You was right, but I had to learn for myself

I guess a time came for me to earn for myself

I hope that this is somewhat of a thank you for all your help

Hope the angels take care of you until I see you there myself



Thank you God for all my set backs

'Cause he the reason I'm able to give back

This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack

Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa

Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back

This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack



And mama said hit them with the inspiration

In times like these we need inspiration

Turn all your problems into inspiration

Elevation, inspiration

I said elevation, inspiration

I said elevation, inspiration



Thank you God for all my set backs

And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices

To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices

Fuck it though that's how hungry my appetite is



I know my great, great, great aunty was a slave

I could only imagine all the sacrifice she made

I could only imagine all the shit she had to take

I'mma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain

I sacrifice for your entertainment boy

I'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix

Check the last name it's all facts

And the human race is all about pacing

Look at all the ones I outlasted

I'm the one at the end like I count backwards

Never satisfied details classified

Till the afterlife make a sacrifice, Don

Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice

Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice"

Get it, get it, get it

I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha

I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture

Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister

I see myself in the young ones

When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror

Corleone all on my own (Don)

Cartier all on my arm

All I hear is sirens and car alarms

Niggas going to war with no armor on

First time I seen a dead body I was 14

And I felt the pressure

Like if I don't get it, might end up next to him

I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7

Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around

The hood America's lost and found

Where niggas get lost and never found

All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and Mercedes keys

Got it and still felt incomplete

That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

But lost my time

That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me



I seen people in the same place 10 years later

Man that shit pathetic

God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it

I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan

When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man

If I ain't special I'll feel it then

I gotta get on the road

I gotta be the one chose

I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told

This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close

And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed

And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

Yeah yeah, I'm listening. I love you too

In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything

That's deep to feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes

Yeah

With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it So I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up, with that in mind it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day. I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh man I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential

It's that simple. It's all about living in the moment. Period"

I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on the stakeout

And you know it's official when I go bringing that bape out

I'm thumbing through the magazines like ""this the girl I'mma take out""

Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way way out

And I've been waiting all god damn year, all year

I can tell that it's near, but near ain't here

Man, them bills is here right now

I guess you shine brightest when the lights down, like now

I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success

What you know about living check to check to living check to check to check to check?

First place, no neck and neck

Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast

Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air

Yeah, saying I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese

Taking double shots like Siamese

I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like sign these

I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees

I should've known back then I wasn't gonna stop

Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top

I said I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gonna stop

Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top

I've been working all week and I know I need ZZZZs

Tryna get paid repeatedly

Jamaica or Cancun, oh now that's where I need to be

Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT

I be thinking about becoming a cop

So I can murder some niggas one by one off legally

I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it

One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership

Was talking to my dad though on some other shit

He like ""man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with

If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it

Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother""

But that's on some other shit, look

I'm into risk and taking it

I'm into making it then back then make it like I ain't made it yet

This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it

I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit

But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work

Even if you don't get paid for it

Shit, call me the greatest

Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour

Like thank you God, look at all we created

And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers"

You do like the solar system and plan it out

So I'm going over time, on the overtime

Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it

Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it

The family never going anorexic

I pay mom mortgage and electric

Never going under even with anesthetics

At the top of the rap game and progressin'

Check after check, checking off my check list

Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish

No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons

The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drinking Hen' and the harder you dance

I swear right now it look like you on a vacation

Gotta get away, make it happen

Whatever happened just had to happen

On vacation, yeah

I know you've been, I know you've been



Dancin', dancin' dancin' like you fucking got a reason

Dancing like it's something to believe in

Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season

Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa

The harder your heart keep beating

Only feel bad while you're thinkin'

Pop pop pop like Pepsi Coke, the best we smoke

Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico

Go go, let me see how wild it get

Bustin' wide as it get

You need to be taken care of and pampered

But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit

Excited, activated get ignited

So many charges on my card oh God I think I got indicted

Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place

Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away

You a star, you need space

We can shoot up by the town

Have you ever been to Texas?

South By Southwest

Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested

Where they might know us off any intersection

I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest

Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it

No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted



I know you've been crying and poutin'

Know you're tired of arguing

But no screaming and shouting

And you know we on a roll like we did good in college

Throwin' hundreds and thousands

Like they not hundreds and thousands

Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things

(I know you've been going through some things you can't explain

Which your may think that shit insane

I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)

I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?

(Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain

I know you runnin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty

That shit can fuck with your mente

I wonder if I fell from the sky

Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly

I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes

Sometimes I wonder if I already died

That shit get deep, deep, deep

Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep



Man I swear to god it get so deep though

That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though

And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed

And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though

See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll

Got off in the game don't need no cheat code

As long as I know the G code

Being paranoid ain't turn me to a creep

You ain't got that metal on your side

Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep

Deep, deeper than telekinesis

Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces

The deeper it gets, boy the pressure increases

But pressure make diamonds

And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory

I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories

You know the story

If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish don't call it

My opponent probably praying for postponement

You fuck with the best rapper don't even know it

It's written in the stars man the sky is the author

I pulled the sword out of the stone I'm King Arthur

Motherfuck your armor nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma

You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and her daughter

Nigga that shit just get deep

Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep



Been going hard all day, wish a nigga would fuck with me

Then I blow the candles out on my cake

And niggas always thinking it's a game, 'til we ran them out the arcade

Stunting in my southern player, reach the caddy like Andre

I talk that cash money shit

YM plus CMB you can do the math for me bitch

Jail time a slap on the wrist

Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips

You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist

Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist

Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense

I got some miles on me but it's cool cause I never get an inch

And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say

Cause shit is deep and in rap I cannot say

That shit enough times like somebody rewind me

Like shit is deeper than rap I cannot say, that shit enough times

I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine

Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs

Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine

Fuck the finish line, just finish in lines

And if getting your point across crosses the line

Some of the time, then cross it with pride

That's real my nigga, remember that

And ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap

So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that

This shit is deep, deep as empty pockets, nigga

We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime

That shit get deep

I wonder if I fell from the sky

Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly

I hope you'll learn to make it on your own
If you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you'll get everything you want and that you choose
I hope that's the realest day that you've ever know
I hope that you'll get the pretty girl, the prettiest of everything

Million dollars cribs, have a million dollars dream

and when you get it all,

Just remember one thing,

Remember one thing

That one man can change the World!

That one man can change the World!



Hol' up, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick

Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it

Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryina to connect the dots

But its hard makin' those attachments

I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day

You know, my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib

Like it was trash day, no Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)

But when you're getting fast money slow down, don't crash

With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas

Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it

Tell your team about it, go make million dollars schemes about it

Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance

Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different

I'd be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it

What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?



I hope you'll learn to make it on your own

If you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone

I hope that you'll get everything you want and that you chose

I hope that's the realest day that you've ever know

I hope that you'll get the pretty girl, the prettiest of everything

Million dollars cribs, have a million dollars dream

and when you get it all,

Just remember one thing,

Remember one thing

That one man can change the World!

That one man can change the World!



My grandma told me if you write your name in stone,

You'll never get the white out

I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house

Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed

I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks

Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast

We need more than what you have,

and then we need more than that

But how am I supposed to say I'm tired

If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions

That I couldn't survive

Went to war, came back alive

On top of that became a female black captain!

When being black you had to extra extra try!

Way before, James Brown made us proud

She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye,

Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive

and she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right

Taught me how to love,

Taught me not to cry

When I die,

I hope you teach me how to fly

All my life you've been that angel in the sky saying



I hope you'll learn to make it on your own

If you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone

I hope that you'll get everything you want and that you chose

I hope that's the realest day that you've ever know

I hope that you'll get the pretty girl, the prettiest of everything

Million dollars cribs, have a million dollars dream

and when you get it all,

Just remember one thing,

Remember one thing

That one man can change the World!

That one man can change the World!



Thank you for callin' me

been thinkin' about me

It's all good I love you

grandma!

Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back

I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that

And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that

Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating

Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it

Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs

And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings

And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk

Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed

What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?

Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this cross

Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off

She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft

Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball

I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw

Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off

Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off

Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk

It be like ""we don't got time for bullshit, dawg""

You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype

You look like the ""um, you owe me"" type

Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no

Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like

""Oh, you owe me likes""

Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em

The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em

The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em

I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em

I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me

When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC

Headed to the game for OKCs

Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD

And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi

Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first

No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth

The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks

I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy

Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know

But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um

White people with a black son

And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation

Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation

Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper

Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn

Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do

Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?

Well what about now? 313

Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change
Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga
And pray I don't see the ends of my paper like P.S nigga

But damn in high school you had the fattest ass

And now me out of high school, you got a fatter ass

Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago

Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know

Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip

And you gave me that head

I swear to God that was the best night of my life

I can't even sit here frontin', lying, pretend

Dancing with your titties out

I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah

But 5 minutes later you on my lap

And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here

You're telling me how you went down South for school

Down near TSU

But you know business majors

You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school

Told her check the valley, seems like out there they be hiring

In L.A where all the girls that look like you aspiring

A new scenery might just be inspiring

She said ""Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good""



Okay I came up how I came up

A little change bring change up

A little fame bring famous

A little danger now I'm dangerous

Gettin' high now I'm the supply now

Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis

Some hoes are the Lebron James of playing mind games

And switch their home team up every single time their mind change

She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top

Spending extra money when she ain't got it, on me

The she turned around said

""I'm so proud, seems like every where I'm hearin' ya

Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria

Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask""

When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past

Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim

Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand

Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye

And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit

Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit

Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit

Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint

Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense

And he said ""Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet""

Sign me, got a profit

Few years later yeah we on here poppin'

And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in

Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it

Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it

Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody

Oh boy, swerve



Okay I came up how I came up

Back when Iceberg and Girbaud
Was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures
Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros

Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us

Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats

You know, spending gas money on everything except gas

Spending my last on the shit that won't last

Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass

A movie and popcorn and caress that ass

Overdress to undress that ass, god bless that ass

It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer

Riding around like we dumber on dumber

Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer

What happened to those days? I really do wonder

When all I did was safe sex, latex

The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade AIDS test fuck

But I ain't flunk once

Back before I got drunk once

I was smoking on haze, all in a daze

My homies would call and say, ""nigga, come roll""



The D grown us to get it man. You know what I’m mean? Just hustle, hustle, hustle. They, you know we, you know, there really wasn’t that much opportunity for us, man. So, we just had to let our nuts hang and just, shit, boss up and, and learn the game

Tryna get a house up in the woods off on 11 Mile, bet it now

One time for the D, Girls that hold me down Corretta style

Free Juan, let him out

And everything I want off in the world is a must-have

I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking ""fuck rap""

Cause there's niggas in the streets

Getting money under my nose that I must stash

I've seen people get murked who ain't deserved that shit

Cops should've protect-and-served and shit

But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit

Ask ""why the attitude?"" cause bitch, you deserve that shit

Bang bang bang, how do you maintain

A sane brain and mind in a city of AKs and K9s?

When only language they know English and gang signs

Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll

Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air

So I can murder some niggas one by one off legally

I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it

One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership

Was talking to my dad though on some other shit

He like ""man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with

If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it

Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother""

But that's on some other shit, look

I'm into risk and taking it

I'm into making it then back then make it like I ain't made it yet

This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it

I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit

But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work

Even if you don't get paid for it

Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour

Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first

Blessings on blessings on blessings

Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons

I treat the beat like it's a reverend

I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions

Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined

I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd and Eddy

Who flip like confetti

And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""

That shit get get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga

Funny thing about talking behind my back

Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga

Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me

This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be

This is that late night working after three, man

This why my old girl was mad at me

This why I'm your majesty, man

The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest

The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest

The feat not divided, the love is divided

And I just gotta thank God that we got it

Blessed

I don't know what I would do without it

Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits

Your prophet will profit, oh God



I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I

I haven't had a G.O.O.D. time in a long time, you know I

I'm way up, I feel blessed

Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)

I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)

Way up, I feel blessed



Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing

Cause that implies that we're back from something

If we're back from something there's some checks you owe us

I expect that payment, nothing less or over

I don't need them favors that you ask me for

I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go

I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram

Them OVO boys, the business man

It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah

You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah

I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah

Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the 6

Look at what we did, yeah

Be quiet, I'm doing a toast

For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most

Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next

I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less

I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press

I am convinced I'm the only one left

That's still doing this shit, man



I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I

I haven't had a G.O.O.D. time in a long time, you know I

I'm way up, I feel blessed

Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)

I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)

Way up, I feel blessed



My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house

So every morning I'm up cause I can't let them down, down

Always down for the cause, never down for the count

I guess when your stars align

You do like the solar system and plan it out

So I'm going over time, on the overtime

Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it

Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it

The family never going anorexic

I pay mom mortgage and electric

Never going under even with anesthetics

At the top of the rap game and progressin'

Check after check, checking off my check list

Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish

No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons

Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together

You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I



I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I

I haven't had a G.O.O.D. time in a long time, you know I

I'm way up, I feel blessed

Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)

I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)

Way up, I feel blessed"

Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina

I'm the good with the evil

Fuck you nice to meet you

You can have a peace sign man without the middle finger

With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me

That's my family tree

They're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet

Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar

Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's

I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go

I mean for real, fuck how you feel

Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah

And everyday I wake up celebratin' shit, why?

Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch

I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich

Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property

From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions

She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison

On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit

For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich

Got a blunt in my dental, goin' HAM in a rental

On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio

I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless

Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless

I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me

I'll make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty

Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South

I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth

Say you want me to win, but hope I lose

I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up

It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up

That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl

I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up

I guess drama makes for the best content

Everything got a bad side, even a conscience

Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious

Feel me when you get a fine bitch

Just don't forget to read the fine print

Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas

Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator

You ain't pop shit
Man I look up to god
I wonder if I fell from the sky

Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly

I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes

Sometimes I wonder if I already died

That shit get deep, deep, deep

Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep



Man I swear to god it get so deep though

That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though

And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed

And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though

See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll

Got off in the game don't need no cheat code

As long as I know the G code

Being paranoid ain't turn me to a creep

You ain't got that metal on your side

Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep

Deep, deeper than telekinesis

Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces

The deeper it gets, boy the pressure increases

But pressure make diamonds

And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory

I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories

You know the story

If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish don't call it

My opponent probably praying for postponement

You fuck with the best rapper don't even know it

It's written in the stars man the sky is the author

I pulled the sword out of the stone I'm King Arthur

Motherfuck your armor nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma

You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and her daughter

Nigga that shit just get deep

I wonder if I fell from the sky

Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly

I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes

Sometimes I wonder if I already died

That shit get deep, deep, deep

Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep



Been going hard all day, wish a nigga would fuck with me

Then I blow the candles out on my cake

And niggas always thinking it's a game, 'til we ran them out the arcade

Stunting in my southern player, reach the caddy like Andre

I talk that cash money shit

YM plus CMB you can do the math for me bitch

Jail time a slap on the wrist

Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips

You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist

Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist

Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense

I got some miles on me but it's cool cause I never get an inch

And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say

Cause shit is deep and in rap I cannot say

That shit enough times like somebody rewind me

Like shit is deeper than rap I cannot say, that shit enough times

I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine

Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs

Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine

Fuck the finish line, just finish in lines

And if getting your point across crosses the line

Some of the time, then cross it with pride

That's real my nigga, remember that

And ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap

So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that

This shit is deep, deep as empty pockets, nigga

We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime

That shit get deep



Man I look up to god

I wonder if I fell from the sky

I hope you'll learn to make it on your own
If you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you'll get everything you want and that you choose
I hope that's the realest day that you've ever know
I hope that you'll get the pretty girl, the prettiest of everything

Million dollars cribs, have a million dollars dream

and when you get it all,

Just remember one thing,

Remember one thing

That one man can change the World!

That one man can change the World!



Hol' up, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick

Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it

Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryina to connect the dots

But its hard makin' those attachments

I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day

You know, my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib

Like it was trash day, no Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)

But when you're getting fast money slow down, don't crash

With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas

Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it

Tell your team about it, go make million dollars schemes about it

Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance

Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different

I'd be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it

What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?



I hope you'll learn to make it on your own

If you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone

I hope that you'll get everything you want and that you chose

I hope that's the realest day that you've ever know

I hope that you'll get the pretty girl, the prettiest of everything

Million dollars cribs, have a million dollars dream

and when you get it all,

Just remember one thing,

Remember one thing

That one man can change the World!

That one man can change the World!



My grandma told me if you write your name in stone,

You'll never get the white out

I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house

Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed

I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks

Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast

We need more than what you have,

and then we need more than that

But how am I supposed to say I'm tired

If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions

That I couldn't survive

Went to war, came back alive

On top of that became a female black captain!

When being black you had to extra extra try!

Way before, James Brown made us proud

She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye,

Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive

and she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right

Taught me how to love,

Taught me not to cry

When I die,

I hope you teach me how to fly

All my life you've been that angel in the sky saying



I hope you'll learn to make it on your own

If you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone

I hope that you'll get everything you want and that you chose

I hope that's the realest day that you've ever know

I hope that you'll get the pretty girl, the prettiest of everything

Million dollars cribs, have a million dollars dream

and when you get it all,

Just remember one thing,

Remember one thing

That one man can change the World!

That one man can change the World!



Thank you for callin' me

been thinkin' about me

It's all good I love you

grandma!

Bye!"

Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back

I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that

And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that

Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating

Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it

Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs

And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings

And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk

Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed

What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?

Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this cross

Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off

She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft

Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball

I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw

Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off

Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off

Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk

It be like ""we don't got time for bullshit, dawg""

You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype

You look like the ""um, you owe me"" type

Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no

Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like

""Oh, you owe me likes""

Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em

The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em

The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em

I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em

I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me

When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC

Headed to the game for OKCs

Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD

And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi

Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first

No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth

The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks

I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy

Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know

But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um

White people with a black son

And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation

Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation

Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper

Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn

Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do

Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?

Well what about now? 313

My, my, my, as the world turns
Today if I don't earn, best believe I'm gon' learn
If I can't do either or, shit it's none of my concern
Watch my enemies burn as I f-fill every urn, ah
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to

The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too

The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too

Niggas seven feet, telling me I'm who they look up to

Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up

Don't invite em to my shows but always still manage to show up

Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion

And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be voting

So when you step inside my office, treat that place like it's the Oval

El presidente, lord, sensei

Do ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting riskay

Crazy nigga, they ain't seen it like this since Ye, yea

Well this the life that I live

Collecting everything overdue, for all the work that I overdid

D-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I'm Oprah kid

Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist

Cause when you come from the bottom man it's so hard to get a glimpse

So hard to get a glimpse, so while I'm here I might take a pic

And show em that it's more to the world than tryna make a living

Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it

Okay, como me llamo

She say Ingles, no hablo, man unless it's eat me out though

Benihani, my McDonald, all black leather jackets

While I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I'm Keanu

Wishing Lamborghinis made of fire though

Cause I got too many real mufuckas I ride for, die for, uh

Straight out the metropolitan

My city need a hero so I treat it like Metropolis

And it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can name

Even though I'm me, Lord knows that I can't say

But I'm still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch

I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain't rich

Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man we ain't make shit

From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge

And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate

Man we was trying to get away, man we was trying to get our day

And damn (damn), tomorrow never seemed so close

And life ain't what it seem no mo' (no mo')

Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast

A million dollars never seemed so broke

And every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with

And niggas suing me and they just banking on the settlement

Never settling, life is too fast just to settle in

So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement like damn!



Shit, can't a young nigga live man

We done worked too hard

Yup, GOOD, Finally Famous nigga

We aint never going broke nigga!"

(Verse 1)

You know I need everything in plural

That's benji's and euro's

I just came back from that Paris

My life is moving in turbo

My pinky ring just dingling

Look how I'm sipping my merlot

Look how I'm hittin' my herbal

Praise God, church ho

What the fuck is you saying?

B.I.G I'm the mayor in the bitch

Ol' fur looking like a bear in this bitch

OH! fuck is you wearing? that's embarrassin shit

Man and to my new girls that's hearing this shit

You fucking with an OG, you should cherish this shit

Man they tell me that they love me, I ain't hearing that shit

They trynna get up in my will and inherit that shit

That's why I'm faded, I'm wasted

I'm living life like it's no jail

House bigger than a hotel

But these hoes tell

So I still take their ass to the hotel

In my hotel

Bad bitches that came through

I'm hitting all that I aim to

So stoned I can't move

So stoned I can't move

She go either way like it's game two

She look at her phone praying it ain't you

Living out all the rumors

Then afterwards, say it ain't true

Man I'm daydreaming while sexing

Her screams remind me I'm in it

And all this champagne that I'm popping

Reminded me that I'm winning

I know we shouldn't get so high

Yea, remind me that when I'm finished

But this the life we chose

It's the only life that we know

Reminiscing when I had no job

Back when I woulda robbed yo job

Me and my niggas on the streets dog

Throwing signs up like we roadside

Now the suits and pasta both bowtie

My Greek girls say ""opa""

My Spanish girls scream ""no mas""

And all the Black girls scream ""don't stop""

Same shit different nights, till I live a different life

Take online classes and turn back into ya'll, hatin'

Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug

From where they move the drugs, Buddha love

Niggas sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkin' bout computer love

All the wrong people you a price tag

Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag

Make it where I'm from, stay who I become

Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view

And have the fam there too

The baddest chick is yonking, imagine this yapping at me

5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon

Now I'm Cali swaggin'

My nigga listen, I'm over the fame

You number 1, I'm nr 23, my mission is take over the game

You rollin' with lames, we ain't rollin' the same

I'm the best out in this muthafucker

If I could get a check out of this muthafucka big enough to set my kids up for life

I could check out of this muthafucka, with no regrets

If you ain't living your life for ya kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect

(Sean, I love you my nigga, I'm out)



(Hook)

As I look up to the sky

Thought about a 100 things to do before I die

Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right

And my family live that life

As I look up to the sky

Thought about a 100 things to do before I die

Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life

Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky

I thought about a 100 things to do before I die



(Verse : Kendrick Lamar)

I gotta break ya fuckin' heart

I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb)

I gotta do something that's innovative

Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part

I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma

Breakfast in bed with plenty of Carne Asada (I gotta)

I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta)

I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise

I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive

But those who lied to the minority will make em turn inside they grave

I can easily pretend like yall, but thats not me

I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth

Need to know every detail about this Earth, the devil controls it

So before you scrutinise how I feel ask God if those polls important

The end is near!



(Hook)

As I look up to the sky

Thought about a 100 things to do before I die

Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right

And my family live that life

As I look up to the sky

Thought about a 100 things to do before I die

Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life

Cause it could all end in one night

(Verse 1)
Welcome to Hell's paradise
I always heard life was a pair of dice
Seven, eleven, or a pair of eyes

As I'm looking at her smearing eyes

She yelling take them glasses off your eyes are the only things that not lying

Not caring to the point that I stopped lying

I tell her I feel the same

She tell me nigga quit playing you the only one that's not crying

You said you wasn't on no steal your man shit

If I broke it off now we won't be on some friend shit

Man, what goes around comes around like some ceiling fan shit

I broke the levy to your eyes

That I don't give a damn shit



(Hook: Chris Brown)

Another time, another time, it's the same old shit

It might be to late, for me to learn from my mistakes

I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you

But you should have used your head first

This might be the biggest mistake, it's too late

Cause two can't be in first place



(Verse 2)

Wake up then, Call your ex and make up then

What was no strings attached got tangled when

Fun stopped being fun, and feeling tried to finagle in

We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in

Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one

You need a good guy, and I'm already not one

She said we lost a kid already, I'm already not that young

My biological clock is ticking, I'm not just trying to have fun

Shits way different from us first chilling

Sometimes last words can have the worst ending

Which we could fast forward time and reverse feelings

Is there a warranty for love to return or fix it

She said you good either way, when it was her last night nigga and me today

You the man, Huh? Getting on the TNA

You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA?

And so on and so on, And the shit just always goes on

Nothing about us feeling right

But she'll be back before the end of the night



(Hook: Chris Brown)

Another time, another time, it's the same old shit

It might be to late, for me to learn from my mistakes

I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you

But you should have used your head first

I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone till we on
Whats up, Finally Famous

I had it on my jacket way back in high school

Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school

So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers

At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this

I woke up early on a saturday

Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today

Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: ""Go rap for Ye

He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday""

Man, that shit sounds stupid then I hang up on his ass

Then called him back like ""Fuck, let's do it""

I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursuit it

I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it

Like, ""Let's do it""

Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches,

Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented

Cause I had a yellow bone, that could've come from out the Simpsons, man

Who claim she never did it (Yeah right)

But under these conditions she was with it, Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished

I been gon for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning.

Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it,

Getting rest that I be missing, but fuck it I'm on a mission.

Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate,

Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot.

I know the Program Director hot, but I spit a freestyle up in there so cold,

That everybody in that bitch forgot, Now I'm running late for sound check,

And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station,

And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme

Manager said we ain't got time, But time to time you gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around.

I say ""Aye dawg, What you got?"", ""Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot. Um alright, stay young ran the game, man they been afraid, tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid, Um, I'm like a young black Eminem, it's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan, tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them.

And the bunch just synonyms about how he was living in, I ain't even let him finish shit, I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I,

So give him my email on a fly, and if it sound good, then I reply, Uhh.

[Outro 1: Big Sean]

Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith,

In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe.

What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch,

What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe.

But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E

All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need.

All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need,

I'm sorry.



[Outro 2: Mama Myra]

I know you're not my child talking like that,

Focus shifting the negative energy, into something positive.

And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, For your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha"

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it

Dealt with real life shit, Manned up and got through it

I'm a real D Boy, take a look up in my face

Never did real estate, but still put you in your place

I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas

From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski

Every time I spit a verse, my city like ""Preach!""

Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets

B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast

Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet

Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week

Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats

Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave

Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speaking trapanese

If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back

Back on my feet, that's just how I be

I be out of town repping valid as an absentee

Lord G's, jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me

Fuck these niggas up, now it's absent teeth

Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the Playoffs bitch

I'm even working half days on my day off bitch

Say it's gon kill me fuck it, I work graveyard shifts

'Long as that weed and money chilling and the power

Bitch I need that fucking fire

I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it

Can do anything in the world except not do it

Bought my fam new six star crib

Momma feeling like she jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest

Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad

Would drive me to school every single chance he had

Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past

And gave me the talks that made me to a man

Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam

And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand

Coming from Detroit where everybody say ""whaddup doe?""

Horror movie nigga, cause everybody there cut throat

Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though,

Even though you deserved a commission plus mo

The grandma sad when she saw my commercial

""Stop having people at your show that wasn't at rehearsal's""

I'm tryna to get a office at the Empire State

To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home

Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state

Prayin' that I won't be late, when it's all finished at the endin'

After all bottles spill it, throttle gripping, models switching

I'm replenished, I done do it just for the money

I could've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a women with a broken heart



Praying to a sky all black

Looking at the stars like they finna talk back

Looking at my phone like she finna call back

But last night I feel like probably ended all that

Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps

Then another one tryna take all back

Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much

Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys they love

I know, I know, I know

The highs, the lows it comes and goes

You say ""be real"" I try, I don't

Cause you take anything and just make it everything

Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (funny right?)

And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)

One time don't change everything

She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same

She's still insane and now she's saying

You shot right through my heart

Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart

Sleep, call

Miss, text

I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy

I drank too much, please call me a cabby

Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy

Third row is when you call, I hit cancel

Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens

Phone in my pocket for the whole night

And you heard bitches screamin' til my phone dies

Then she text me like ""why you still talk to my mama?""

How the fuck you run around with condoms?

Why you make me get this tattoo?

Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college

What? all because I had you

Nigga I don't even have you

How am I suppose to get past you?

And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit

Now they problems he got to deal with

I could've seen this coming right from the start

You should beware, beware, beware of a women with a broken heart



Girl, don't believe them hoes

Cause they don't wanna see us together

And you already know you're too fly

But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers

I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous

You know they never like it when you never say never

Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless

Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris

I be screaming out, ""ain't no woman like the one I got""

But she be always worrying about the one I fucked

She said it's gonna be me, myself and I

When you said it was over

You shot right through my heart

Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart

Ooh, I was so mad

I could've seen this coming right from the start

You should beware, beware, beware of a women with a broken heart



Baby, last time calling me baby

Last time calling me crazy

Crazy, crazy



Baby, last time calling me baby

Last time calling me crazy

Crazy, crazy"

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes

Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals

BIG was the first one that had it

Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic

Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace

Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic

Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt

Used to pick me up from school right after work

Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church

She's ask why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first

Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view

Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew

Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do

Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you



[Hook]

Got my first chain

Feeling like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain



[Bridge]

BIG was the first one that had it

Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain



[Verse 2: Nas]

What's the noise all about with this rap stuff

I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up

I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up

I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up

Cause it's a mental game, I learned that when I got my first initial chain

I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'

To those dealing with blow, had the [?] it was those gangsters

That bonus, that culture, those projects

Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint

They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones

Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs

18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long

My pendant offensive, in the truest form

Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?



[Hook]



[Bridge]

BIG was the first one that had it

Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic

And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain



[Verse 3: Big Sean]

On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid

I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved

No matter what why I turn things go my way

I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave

Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga

To remind me of everything that we did, nigga

Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'

No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying

I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb

But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind

Police only work 12-hour shifts

Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch

Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues

FF good, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews

Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools

Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge

God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D.

Off this asparagus and bread and pasta

Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days

It's like I got a built-in doppler

And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame

I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'

But remember my first ass and the first time she came

It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain



[Hook]



[Bridge]

Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing

Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame

Stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain



[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]

It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things

Niggas and bitches, where you at?

I got my mind is on me

A couple others and dreams, would've seen me

Me and my niggas in this bitch

About two months in a week's time

Movin, feelin hellish [?] with lemon, lime shine

Now how the fuck can I chill now?

Kanye think I'm dope

See this piece that I own now

How sick is the rope?

Taking life for what it is

The troublesome chick, who throws fists

Sometimes it's the weather

Things switch up, people trip up

The money come down, then climb up

But when it come again

The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'

Saying that you love me, you surely do and if you don't

Motherfuck that sometimes

So dead it, shred it

Young nigga lost to the night

I'm so ready to let it go

My life is fucking awesome, I could be fuckin' dead right now,

But I'm awesome

So fuck whoever has a bad thought

Don't know the god

Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God

It might be too late, but the song's will live on

Just know this fact, you were all wrong

Now watch me do my silly dance

Not really a dance, more like a prance

I'm signing off with a crotch grab



[Outro: Kid Cudi]

Thank you man. for letting me get on this record Sean

You the coolest

GOOD music nigga forever

I'm eating lobster with my shrimp hand

Feeling on her with my pimp hand

I'm talking to her like her Daddy do

And bet she give me everything but attitude

Mathematical, radical

Twist my fingers up and rep my avenue

Penthouse altitude, being broke is not compatible

Get a fine girl, Patron that

Get a finer one, and then clone that

You cuff your wife like I want that

When I got freaky women tongue kissing

Marijuana lung lifting

Give long dick then I'm long distance

You in the club bromancing

I got her homancing

Face in my lap nose dancing

No pants screaming

Put yo mama on that trippy shit, sippin lean, snorting lines

Overseas like bonjour

Last ten years I've been on tour

And I still got that old money

I touch more green than a lawnmower

With a ratchet bitch, you laid up

I'm on my tour bus fucking mamas getting paid up

I take that bitch to my mansion

And a nigga can't pay her to leave

Yo mama a great head doctor, with no PhD

My pockets stuffed with dough

I made it all in the streets

I might just go to the club, and throw it all on a freak

(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)

Let's get it



[Verse 1: Big Sean]

Today is a good day

I wish a nigga would day

Ride through the hood day

Ride through the hood where I would stay

If I wasn't me, wasn't committed

I told my mom and my dad it'll be the last Christmas

In the hood that you can visit oh boy I gotta know chasers

Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems

I took that advice young when I was headed up to college

Momma swimming in that debt

Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark

Ready set go, on your mark to the top

Getting rich ain't a blessing it's a choice

Drunk and still drinking out the bottle

I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model

You ain't alive if you ain't living that's the motto

And imma' probably wake up tomorrow sayin, sayin



[Hook: Big Sean]



[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]

Lets get it, yeah be alright nigga

It's the motherfucking world nigga

Getcha some time to just do it how I done it

First up on the first cause' first of all you gotta want it

Re-up time for every penny, never fronted

So room for, paid every penny then I stunted

Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman

TS4 with 23's I'm talking jumpmans

Twos and thirds watch for the blitz

You know they rush

Just don't get caught in the coupe with them birds

End of discussion

Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken

If them niggas think I'm riding with that, them niggas tripping

Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause' imma' grinder

Told my olds im hiding you here, so they won't find you

What you know about a bag that's heavy as anacondas?

Bet you one thing, I ain't talking no marijuana

That's whats wrong with these niggas they think it's about shine

You niggas get back to your grind, I think it's about time



[Hook: Big Sean]



[Verse 3: Payroll]

They say it's my time according to my Rolex

I'm bout to fuck the game, then your ho next

I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex

No yoga boy I was making blow stretch

Press the fast forward button, I'm pushing a foreign something

All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood

My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good

I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good

It's time for a new crib, it's time for a new chain

20 thousand on me homie that's just loose change

Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess

But if you knew bout my hood you'd say that nigga is blessed

Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?

Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door

Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though

The hustle's who I represent, dope boys we in this bitch

Detroit, once the backbone of this country

Now it's the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy

Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant

Going from a population of nearly 2 million

To under 700,000 in a number of years

The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together,

To make it through these tough times"

""Might not make it this time""

Is what not to say at this time

Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear

And you tell them they alright, when they need a cure

I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand

Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand

Around the same time my mom said ""Sean, you need a plan

Mrs. Freeman's son, across the street got shot,

Now she need a hand!""

Traumatized, gotta watch, his momma cry

Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, tell his momma lies

Like, ""It's gonna be alright,"" knowing it ain't alright

I know there's just so much pain, and there's probably more on the way

[Verse 2]

You know I love you momma like she mine,

Whether we together, or we trying

We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times

We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time

The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime

It came from the breast, just spread to the spine

It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:

""This can't be my mom!""

Got me thinking, ""whats a girl to do, a girl to do?

When her world's a pool?

And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames

And all the stress is all propane

She's burned again""

Hoping I could make her smile

Take cancer and David Blaine it out,

POOF! Disappear, God make an out!

Yeah, I got a brand new Benz

Crazy right, brand new Benz

Got less miles on it than I do friends

Remember when we laid at you and [?] crib

Was there so long I coulda paid rent

Remember when we couldn't get shit?

Best thing bout being broke is you don't spend shit

Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list

We couldn't afford nothin' but we still get shit ironically

Those were the times I felt the richest

All those times that we spent by the pool girl

Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl

Maybe its because I had you girl

Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris

And gave each other times that we cherished

Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower

And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed

See those are times I can't let go, I can't let go

Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs

So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like let's go

My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets

Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep

Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep

Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful

Distasteful yeah I know you're not supposed to have cake and eat too

Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full

What about the emails you hacked in?

I know we hate to live in the past-tense

It's been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D

And ain't came back since

Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city

That's about the time that you left for the city

You and all your girls moved to NY,

I shoulda' known now how you watch sex and the city

I know we ain't close but, I gotta focus on blowing up

I know I promised that I'd be there, and really did I ever show up?

I know I wasn't honest to ya girl

Almost broke every promise to ya girl

Brought problems to your world

And you said how could you just lie to me? I thought you'd die for me?

I was scared you'd find somebody you was supposed to

You the type niggas get close to, and then propose to

And when thanksgivings come around,

I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma

So it's back to the drama,

No I don't know that number

Why the hell you text it?

Young and living reckless

It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out

Next time somebody try to tell you how to run your shit

And they're ain't shit

Do yourself a favor and kick 'em out.

Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life

I always say long days is better than long nights

At least in the day you've got shade

In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights

I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March ninth

I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights

'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries

Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe

Now I didn't know it was off of infested streets

Be the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat

I guess that's the hunger that got me out

At the top of hotel suites renting lobbys out, you know?

Stuntin' like a bitch, prime night to be out

And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route

That was back when I was seventeen

It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had it all figured out



[Hook]



[Verse 2]

It's crazy how much you can see with your eyes closed

'Specially if you've got a vision

Or how you could have everything, and still think about everything missing

Like I probably remember the times I missed out on more than the ones I lived

I probably remember the girls that I ain't have more than the ones I did

But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way, two lyin and one b

Smoke so much I need two lighters

Shoppin overseas I do buy it

They taught me that I had to dream, black history month

I wake up and treat the day like stack history month

I'm talkin' Malcolm X, Jessie Flaxon, front of the plane I'm talkin Rosa Parks

V. Swervin like it's O.J. --- oh

To me and my dogs is all gettin out

Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out

Take extra shots for my dogs missin out

That keep remindin' me at the same time

That I still don't have it all figured out

Fact, the only thing I really figured out

Is that i'll never have it all figured out, fuck.

Even when your bank account is all figured out

Even when your bank account gets all figured out

Even when your best friend gets all tricked out"

Where ho's call me Mr. Anderson

Command a bitch, no I don't own the pussy I just sample it

I got a couple marbles missing I know

Now there's marbles all on the floor

On the bathroom, kitchen and stove

I got bitches on my cellular callin and confessing

But I don't reply cause thats the clearest way to send a message

Paper running through my jugular

I'm blowing loud, throwing thous, getting drunk

You know my style

And my momma say she still proud, that's mula

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]

(2 CHAINZ)

I'm winning, I don't owe a nigga shit

Came in this motherfucker by myself

Smoking on strong, and holding on my dick like AH

My gold on, I'm the bomb,I'm talking goldmine

Nigga's taking shots at me, I send em' back to their homeline

And I touchdown, goalline, y'all ain't, killing, shit

Shoot every nigga in your clique,I'm on one, let me jog your memory

Me and Nells on a milerun, uh, shawty gonna need her drawers done

Eat her pussy til' it's all gone, uh

And I still ain't ever been robbed, so nigga don't try me

Two niggas with guns, natural wallet

That pickpocket want my I.D and I spray your zone

Treat niggas like strippers and put cash on em'

Got a new chomp, I need that bitch that want a tag on

If you shoot me, you famous, if I shoot you, I'm brainless

So I'm about to be, dumb as fuck, cause' I got blessed fools and babies

When I was fifteen I was felon,

When you were fifteen you were yelling

Mama come get this nigga off my fucking melon

Whats up, Finally Famous

I had it on my jacket way back in high school

Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school

So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers

At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this

I woke up early on a saturday

Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today

Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: ""Go rap for Ye

He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday""

Man, that shit sounds stupid then I hang up on his ass

Then called him back like ""Fuck, let's do it""

I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursuit it

I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it

Like, ""Let's do it""

Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches,

Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented

Cause I had a yellow bone, that could've come from out the Simpsons, man

Who claim she never did it (Yeah right)

But under these conditions she was with it, Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished

I been gon for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning.

Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it,

Getting rest that I be missing, but fuck it I'm on a mission.

Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate,

Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot.

I know the Program Director hot, but I spit a freestyle up in there so cold,

That everybody in that bitch forgot, Now I'm running late for sound check,

And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station,

And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme

Manager said we ain't got time, But time to time you gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around.

I say ""Aye dawg, What you got?"", ""Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot. Um alright, stay young ran the game, man they been afraid, tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid, Um, I'm like a young black Eminem, it's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan, tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them.

And the bunch just synonyms about how he was living in, I ain't even let him finish shit, I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I,

So give him my email on a fly, and if it sound good, then I reply, Uhh.

[Outro 1: Big Sean]

Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith,

In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe.

What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch,

What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe.

But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E

All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need.

All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need,

I'm sorry.



[Outro 2: Mama Myra]

I know you're not my child talking like that,

Focus shifting the negative energy, into something positive.

And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, For your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha"

Dealt with real life shit, Manned up and got through it

I'm a real D Boy, take a look up in my face

Never did real estate, but still put you in your place

I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas

From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski

Every time I spit a verse, my city like ""Preach!""

Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets

B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast

Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet

Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week

Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats

Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave

Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speaking trapanese

If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back

Back on my feet, that's just how I be

I be out of town repping valid as an absentee

Lord G's, jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me

Fuck these niggas up, now it's absent teeth

Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the Playoffs bitch

I'm even working half days on my day off bitch

Say it's gon kill me fuck it, I work graveyard shifts

Bitch I need that fucking fire

Can do anything in the world except not do it

Bought my fam new six star crib

Momma feeling like she jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest

Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad

Would drive me to school every single chance he had

Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past

And gave me the talks that made me to a man

Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam

And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand

Coming from Detroit where everybody say ""whaddup doe?""

Horror movie nigga, cause everybody there cut throat

Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though,

Even though you deserved a commission plus mo

The grandma sad when she saw my commercial

""Stop having people at your show that wasn't at rehearsal's""

I'm tryna to get a office at the Empire State

To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home

Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state

Prayin' that I won't be late, when it's all finished at the endin'

After all bottles spill it, throttle gripping, models switching

I could've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a women with a broken heart



Praying to a sky all black

Looking at the stars like they finna talk back

Looking at my phone like she finna call back

But last night I feel like probably ended all that

Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps

Then another one tryna take all back

Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much

Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys they love

I know, I know, I know

The highs, the lows it comes and goes

You say ""be real"" I try, I don't

Cause you take anything and just make it everything

Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (funny right?)

And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)

One time don't change everything

She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same

She's still insane and now she's saying

I drank too much, please call me a cabby

Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy

Third row is when you call, I hit cancel

Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens

Phone in my pocket for the whole night

And you heard bitches screamin' til my phone dies

Then she text me like ""why you still talk to my mama?""

How the fuck you run around with condoms?

Why you make me get this tattoo?

Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college

What? all because I had you

Nigga I don't even have you

How am I suppose to get past you?

And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit

Now they problems he got to deal with

Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless

Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris

I be screaming out, ""ain't no woman like the one I got""

But she be always worrying about the one I fucked

She said it's gonna be me, myself and I

Damn, that would make me a one-eyed fuck

Sch, I was so mad

Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped

But players fuck up, my bad

And just to keep from crying, I laughed



When you said it was over

You shot right through my heart

Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart

Ooh, I was so mad

I could've seen this coming right from the start

You should beware, beware, beware of a women with a broken heart



Baby, last time calling me baby

Last time calling me crazy

Crazy, crazy



Baby, last time calling me baby

Last time calling me crazy

Crazy, crazy"

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes

Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals

BIG was the first one that had it

Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic

Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace

Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic

Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt

Used to pick me up from school right after work

Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church

She's ask why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first

Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view

Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew

Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do

Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you



[Hook]

Got my first chain

Feeling like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain



[Bridge]

BIG was the first one that had it

Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain



[Verse 2: Nas]

What's the noise all about with this rap stuff

I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up

I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up

I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up

Cause it's a mental game, I learned that when I got my first initial chain

I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'

To those dealing with blow, had the [?] it was those gangsters

That bonus, that culture, those projects

Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint

They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones

Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs

18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long

My pendant offensive, in the truest form

Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?



[Hook]



[Bridge]

BIG was the first one that had it

Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic

And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain



[Verse 3: Big Sean]

On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid

I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved

No matter what why I turn things go my way

I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave

Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga

To remind me of everything that we did, nigga

Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'

No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying

I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb

But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind

Police only work 12-hour shifts

Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch

Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues

FF good, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews

Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools

Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge

God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D.

Off this asparagus and bread and pasta

Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days

It's like I got a built-in doppler

And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame

I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'

But remember my first ass and the first time she came

It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain



[Hook]



[Bridge]

Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing

Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame

Stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain



[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]

It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things

Niggas and bitches, where you at?

I got my mind is on me

A couple others and dreams, would've seen me

Me and my niggas in this bitch

About two months in a week's time

Movin, feelin hellish [?] with lemon, lime shine

Now how the fuck can I chill now?

Kanye think I'm dope

See this piece that I own now

How sick is the rope?

Taking life for what it is

The troublesome chick, who throws fists

Sometimes it's the weather

Things switch up, people trip up

The money come down, then climb up

But when it come again

The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'

Saying that you love me, you surely do and if you don't

Motherfuck that sometimes

So dead it, shred it

Young nigga lost to the night

I'm so ready to let it go

My life is fucking awesome, I could be fuckin' dead right now,

But I'm awesome

So fuck whoever has a bad thought

Don't know the god

Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God

It might be too late, but the song's will live on

Just know this fact, you were all wrong

Now watch me do my silly dance

Not really a dance, more like a prance

I'm signing off with a crotch grab



[Outro: Kid Cudi]

Thank you man. for letting me get on this record Sean

You the coolest

GOOD music nigga forever

That's what I'm down for no convo, my condo

And if I answer this phone call don't make a sound ho

My life is my audacity my dogs to the right of me

I got the girl you can't lay a finger on right here massaging me

(Bad Bitches [x4])



[Verse 2:]

I'm eating lobster with my shrimp hand

Feeling on her with my pimp hand

I'm talking to her like her Daddy do

And bet she give me everything but attitude

Mathematical, radical

Twist my fingers up and rep my avenue

Penthouse altitude, being broke is not compatible

Get a fine girl, Patron that

Get a finer one, and then clone that

You cuff your wife like I want that

When I got freaky women tongue kissing

Marijuana lung lifting

Give long dick then I'm long distance

You in the club bromancing

I got her homancing

Face in my lap nose dancing

No pants screaming

Put yo mama on that trippy shit, sippin lean, snorting lines

Overseas like bonjour

Last ten years I've been on tour

And I still got that old money

I touch more green than a lawnmower

With a ratchet bitch, you laid up

I'm on my tour bus fucking mamas getting paid up

I take that bitch to my mansion

And a nigga can't pay her to leave

Yo mama a great head doctor, with no PhD

My pockets stuffed with dough

I made it all in the streets

I might just go to the club, and throw it all on a freak

Yo mama

(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)

Let's get it



[Verse 1: Big Sean]

Today is a good day

I wish a nigga would day

Ride through the hood day

Ride through the hood where I would stay

If I wasn't me, wasn't committed

I told my mom and my dad it'll be the last Christmas

In the hood that you can visit oh boy I gotta know chasers

Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems

I took that advice young when I was headed up to college

Momma swimming in that debt

Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark

Ready set go, on your mark to the top

Getting rich ain't a blessing it's a choice

Drunk and still drinking out the bottle

I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model

You ain't alive if you ain't living that's the motto

And imma' probably wake up tomorrow sayin, sayin



[Hook: Big Sean]



[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]

Lets get it, yeah be alright nigga

It's the motherfucking world nigga

Getcha some time to just do it how I done it

First up on the first cause' first of all you gotta want it

Re-up time for every penny, never fronted

So room for, paid every penny then I stunted

Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman

TS4 with 23's I'm talking jumpmans

Twos and thirds watch for the blitz

You know they rush

Just don't get caught in the coupe with them birds

End of discussion

Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken

If them niggas think I'm riding with that, them niggas tripping

Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause' imma' grinder

Told my olds im hiding you here, so they won't find you

What you know about a bag that's heavy as anacondas?

Bet you one thing, I ain't talking no marijuana

That's whats wrong with these niggas they think it's about shine

You niggas get back to your grind, I think it's about time



[Hook: Big Sean]



[Verse 3: Payroll]

They say it's my time according to my Rolex

I'm bout to fuck the game, then your ho next

I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex

No yoga boy I was making blow stretch

Press the fast forward button, I'm pushing a foreign something

All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood

My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good

I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good

It's time for a new crib, it's time for a new chain

20 thousand on me homie that's just loose change

Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess

But if you knew bout my hood you'd say that nigga is blessed

Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?

Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door

Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though

The hustle's who I represent, dope boys we in this bitch

[Outro]

Detroit, once the backbone of this country

Now it's the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy

Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant

Going from a population of nearly 2 million

To under 700,000 in a number of years

The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together,

To make it through these tough times"

""Might not make it this time""

Is what not to say at this time

Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear

And you tell them they alright, when they need a cure

I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand

Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand

Around the same time my mom said ""Sean, you need a plan

Mrs. Freeman's son, across the street got shot,

Now she need a hand!""

Traumatized, gotta watch, his momma cry

Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, tell his momma lies

Like, ""It's gonna be alright,"" knowing it ain't alright

I know there's just so much pain, and there's probably more on the way

[Verse 2]

You know I love you momma like she mine,

Whether we together, or we trying

We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times

We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time

The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime

It came from the breast, just spread to the spine

It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:

""This can't be my mom!""

Got me thinking, ""whats a girl to do, a girl to do?

When her world's a pool?

And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames

And all the stress is all propane

She's burned again""

Hoping I could make her smile

Take cancer and David Blaine it out,

POOF! Disappear, God make an out!

Yeah, I got a brand new Benz

Crazy right, brand new Benz

Got less miles on it than I do friends

Remember when we laid at you and [?] crib

Was there so long I coulda paid rent

Remember when we couldn't get shit?

Best thing bout being broke is you don't spend shit

Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list

We couldn't afford nothin' but we still get shit ironically

Those were the times I felt the richest

All those times that we spent by the pool girl

Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl

Maybe its because I had you girl

Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris

And gave each other times that we cherished

Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower

And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed

See those are times I can't let go, I can't let go

Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs

So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like let's go

[Verse 2: Big Sean]

My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets

Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep

Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep

Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful

Distasteful yeah I know you're not supposed to have cake and eat too

Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full

What about the emails you hacked in?

I know we hate to live in the past-tense

It's been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D

And ain't came back since

Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city

That's about the time that you left for the city

You and all your girls moved to NY,

I shoulda' known now how you watch sex and the city

I know we ain't close but, I gotta focus on blowing up

I know I promised that I'd be there, and really did I ever show up?

I know I wasn't honest to ya girl

Almost broke every promise to ya girl

Brought problems to your world

And you said how could you just lie to me? I thought you'd die for me?

I was scared you'd find somebody you was supposed to

You the type niggas get close to, and then propose to

And when thanksgivings come around,

I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma

So it's back to the drama,

No I don't know that number

Why the hell you text it?

Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in

Young and living reckless

Just because your bank account gets all figured out

Next time somebody try to tell you how to run your shit

And they're ain't shit

Do yourself a favor and kick 'em out.

Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life

I always say long days is better than long nights

At least in the day you've got shade

In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights

I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March ninth

I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights

'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries

Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe

Now I didn't know it was off of infested streets

Be the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat

I guess that's the hunger that got me out

At the top of hotel suites renting lobbys out, you know?

Stuntin' like a bitch, prime night to be out

And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route

That was back when I was seventeen

It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had it all figured out

[Verse 2]

It's crazy how much you can see with your eyes closed

'Specially if you've got a vision

Or how you could have everything, and still think about everything missing

Like I probably remember the times I missed out on more than the ones I lived

I probably remember the girls that I ain't have more than the ones I did

But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way, two lyin and one b

Smoke so much I need two lighters

Shoppin overseas I do buy it

They taught me that I had to dream, black history month

I wake up and treat the day like stack history month

I'm talkin' Malcolm X, Jessie Flaxon, front of the plane I'm talkin Rosa Parks

V. Swervin like it's O.J. --- oh

To me and my dogs is all gettin out

Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out

Take extra shots for my dogs missin out

That keep remindin' me at the same time

That I still don't have it all figured out

Fact, the only thing I really figured out

Is that i'll never have it all figured out, fuck.

Even when your bank account is all figured out

Even when your bank account gets all figured out

Even when your best friend gets all tricked out"
