I know we do a lot of fast and slow

I know you gon' ride the dick like a pro

I know you got a lot of faith in me

I know you put a lot of things on hold

I hope you got a policy

You know you got a lock on the whole thing



I had to tell you somethin', tell you somethin' before I go

I left a lil' somethin' special in the envelope

I had to mail you somethin', tell me when it's at the door

And when you open it, I hope you get hysterical

I had to share it with somebody that I really trust

So when we celebrate, I'ma hit you up

I had to go and find a runnin' mate who didn't rush

I hope you know it was imperative for both of us

You know that you my motherfuckin' cinnamon apple (Yeah)

Know that when it come to lovin' you, I'm a natural

Know how much you hurt me, that's in the past though

When I'm all alone, better not be with that ho, oh-oh-oh

I had to deal with your sides and your pieces (Yeah, yeah)

I put two and two together in the sequence

I promise that I'm tryin' not to be on defense

But I'm reminded of it every time you leave

With both hands on the sweeper, cleanin' up dirty secrets

Told you don't ever give me that gushy, but I didn't mean it

Bring her home and I'ma bust it out the residence

When I get the gushy, I go dumb like the President

Yes, lawd, I'm way up, word to Sacajawea

If the gushy was a sneaker, it'd be moccasin trainer

If the gushy wasn't so sweet, I could save it for later

But every time I poke myself, I wish it was there

If I had the gushy, I'd know how the fuck I get here

I got hoes, I got hoes, we don't need to go there

On my way out a zone, somebody gon' give me body

Pick my feet off the floor, boy, I think I'm fallin'

Chicken wings and sushi, I've gotten used to the perks

Narrowly escapin' the holy war on the turf

But God if you're listening

Trimmin' flowers in the Marriott with little cuz

Send 'em off to Arizona, let 'em build a buzz

Then get it back for triple the profit, help 'em split it up

If they plottin', then help me see it before they get the drop on me

Probably coulda been a doctor, I'm fond of optometry

Vision was like Martin Luther on the mountain peak

Valley lows, I left home for more salary

Smoke with O's across border patrol, casually

Took notes and took control of it manually

Hand to hand 'til it's white sands in the canopy

Now follow me

I'm too old to act childishly

But every now and then I park the Beamer in the gallery

Show off the paint for spectators and the faculty

Same ol' niggas that said they proud of me

Same ol' niggas that probably doubted me

1989, gangbangin' was at it's peak

This the beat that make me reminisce on G-Funk

Three summers before The Chronic hit the streets

I would rather slang hand to hand to a fiend

Rappin' on the side, trappin' was priority

But every now and then I go scoop my little thing

Pull up in my emcee bangin' New Jack Swing

Ooh, summertime time back in Long Beach

Passin' one bottle, forty ounce old E

I didn't have a dollar but a nigga had a dream

Whippin' over the stove and a nigga gotta eat

Threw my raps in the garbage, fuck bein' an emcee

Thank the Lord for Nate Dogg and thank God for Warren G

Funny how time flies when you're high as me



I think I'm in the Ruff Endz, now

I seen her throwin' up H-Town

You was livin' off of a Dru Hill

Wasn't ready for the rubber, baby, who is?

Know you prettier than all the El Debarges

Never worry 'bout the Total of the charges

We do it anywhere

And if you feelin', just call me, baby

I'll have you screamin'

Cheek to cheek just like they do in the movies

I'm lookin' for a shallow half hour, you know?



Don't you have luck with women?

[Rodney Dangerfield:] 

I never had luck with women

I'm no ladies man, I know that, Johnny

And I never got girls when I was a kid in show business either, you know?

One girl told me, ""Come on over, there's nobody home""

I went over, there was nobody home!



You and I will always be somewhere between

You and I will always be somewhere between

Sweet Trippy, I'm yours for the gettin'

Talkin' foolish, had the moon, I was gone, eighteen hunnid, sippin'



I can't get rid of you, all the places that I used to go and kick it

All this weight that I'm liftin', trippy



Come meet me in the middle, right there where you always be

Somewhere in between, you and I will always be

Come meet me in the middle, right there where we always be

Somewhere in between, you and I will always be

Come meet me in the middle (I'll meet you in the middle)

Come meet me in the middle (Somewhere in between)

Without a space I could feel, in the words to define

Pick it up, if you will, heavy weight on my mind

Just a pretty brown thing wit'cho head in the clouds

Why don't you slip the round thing in the palm of my hands

Up enough for the thrill, over over you spill

Open up, I could tell

I could see when it's real

And as soon as I grab ahold of ya, I'ma have to let go of ya



Came down the block, somethin' sick, but it's rented

I don't give a fuck, bitch, either way, I'm in it

I ain't gotta prove to you that I got bread

Niggas talkin' money but broker than the bed that I slept on back in Muammed crib

'Member fuckin' hoes leanin' all the left

Don't know why they rock wit' a nigga, but they did

Damn sure wasn't the money, maybe it's the kid?

Used to have a honey that we loved when we was young but somehow got disconnected before Facebook got so big

I used to search her name hopin' we could reconnect

But if I sent the message, would she still be on my dick?

When I couldn't find her, had me feelin' mad lame

Maybe she got married and she changed her last name

Maybe she just ain't up on the latest of the internet and ain't got into that

But give her time, that'll change

Bingo, what do you know?

Years later, late night after a show we here later

Brown skin, love how it glow, your hair tighter

Ask, ""Is it cool if I smoke?"" Go 'head, light up

High from your fragrance, I love, you smell purrty

Know I got it straight from the mud, my nails dirty

If somehow we both loose touch, I won't lie, ya got me open way too much, I'm gon' find ya



We should be lost in the deep end, like water to a fish scale

Why don't I just swim?



I can't get rid of you, all the places that I used to go and kick it

All this weight that I'm liftin', trippy



Come meet me in the middle, right there where you always be

Somewhere in between, you and I will always be

Wishin' I still had Mac wit' me

How do you tell a nigga slow it down when you livin' just as fast as 'em?

I couldn't understand when I see 'em stretched out cold on the pavement

Niggas catch T-K-O's on occasion

Wishin' I could save 'em, what was I to say?

I was doin' dates, dippin' in and out of state

We was goin' in to get away

Sick of feelin' so outta place

Wishin' I could save ya, what was I to say?

Wishin' I could save ya, but now it's too late

Now, is this really what I wanted?

Is it really worth the pain?

Now am I really an asshole? Fuck what you say

Don't do me no favors, let's get back to basics

We live for today, bitch, look up out my way, bitch

I'm losin' all my aces, I'm runnin' outta patience

Got some pretty faces knowin' what my name is

Up in high places, I got some new neighbors

They don't really say shit but when they see the spaceship

They just think I ride with some form of entertainment

But they don't know I'm black, young, gifted and amazin'



You know I had to close my eyes, yeah

And if I have to free my mind

I may not have the lane, movin' all along

Knowin' that I can't do it on my own

And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out

Have to run away, think I'm goin' home



You know I'm workin' on a world premiere

And I could see the world from here

I know you somewhere in the atmosphere

I know someday I'll meet you halfway there (Cheers)

They say there's nothin' you can do about it

Can't say that I'm new to sorrow

Wishin' I could take your problems trade 'em for a little more time wit'chu

Carry you out the bottom, the weight of the world, I got it

Sprouted wit'chu on my shoulder, the greatest honor to know ya

I'd rather be honest wit'cha, I hate you ain't in the picture

I hate all them fake niggas claimin' like they gon' really miss ya

I know there's no one to blame

Maybe the point that I'm missin'

But I needed a minute, just give me a minute



You know I had to close my eyes, yeah

And if I have to free my mind

I may not have the lane, movin' all along

Knowin' that I can't do it on my own

And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out

Oh, say it ain't so!

Tears keep fallin' down my eyes

Damn it, I miss you, I should be with you

Can't turn back the hands of time but I should be with you

I miss my friend

Damn it, I miss you

Can't bring you back



These pictures I'm seein' are fuckin' me up, and

And I don't know what to do but reminisce and face the pain

Back in the day before you were a dog and you were just pup

Bangin' beats and bringin' bitches back to the tour bus

Excuse me, y'all, I know this Paak. shit, I just need a second

It's Q-Tip in this bitch and I'm just in here reflectin'

Head on collisions with memories in the intersection

Lookin' in my rearview, wishin' I could be near you

The freeways of my mind are crowded with traffic

The good times that we had and them bad habits

Look at me now, look around, last man standin'

Grown man cryin' like a child tryna understand it

So sick of sendin' flowers to all my of brother's mommas

Don't know what's harder, fightin' trauma or keepin' a promise

A true confession breath is blessin', without a question

But niggas don't get the message 'til they get disconnected

My story ain't over, I'm still turnin' pages

But the picture that I painted with you in it has faded

My queen, my dreams and even my wages

I know what it means to lose everything when you made it

Rags to the riches and back to the rags is muh'fucka

The consequence of puttin' all your chips in one bucket

To be honest, I feel like gettin' right back to these commas

You mother fuckers keep the drama



I'm workin' on a world premiere

And I could see the world from here

I know there must be somethin' after here

I know some day I'll meet ya halfway there in the atmosphere

Cheers



Free my mind

You know I had to close my eyes

Close my eyes

You know I have to free my mind

Look at you niggas, wonder why I fucking hate rap

You could proceed, but with caution

Give the proceeds to my God-kids

Old dirt on my conscience

Lame niggas wanna pop shit

Get dropped quick by a drop kick

Why you gotta lie to me so much, babe?

You tell me the same shit that you told what's-his-name

If it don't work out, I'll go back to hustling

Couple hundred-thousand up in my mother's name, peace

World peace, niggas talk about ""Don't shoot""

Tell that to police

Scared, ain't none of them prepared, I could see

Promise I'ma get them commas before I decease

My meter should be up by the half

A ticket is the least of my cares

So let me ask you

Am I dreaming?

Mind on a tip of a cloud

Or is it real as the stone in your crown?

Say, ain't nobody towing my Jag

Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?

Your heart don't stand a chance

I'm waiting for the white flag

You're talking with the blunt in your hand

And won't you pass that?

I know, in the morning

The sunlight cover your wounds

But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew

Baby, of course, I flew

But I'm not over what we had

And I can do anything but move backwards

The hardest thing is to keep from being distracted

Tell Uncle Sam I just need a second to add this

Gave my momma ten racks

And she packed and went to Chumash with it

Could triple the worth and give me half of it

The rest got lost in Saks with my wifey, no BM

Whack niggas dropping links in my DM

And the price is through the muthafuckin' roof

But not in my soul



I bring you greetings from the first church of Goon Baptists

United Fellowship of Free Nationals

Residing pastor is thy .Paak

And the first lady is a bad bitch

With slanted eyelids and sick hashish

Sunglasses, Martin Luther King fan for you bitch niggas

Sweating on my Patent Leathers

Pressure turned their feather weight into a Cinderella

I ain't seen the ground in days since I grew propellers

We'll do one better

Word to the liquor that killed my grandpa liver

I know you finally look proud, a nigga smiling

To every hundred niggas that came and gone missing

Only a handful will go the distance

I swear I seen this shit coming as if I was living up under the plumbing

While niggas was riffing and mumbling 'bout, what they could do

I was cooking gumbo whipping the voodoo

I was in the jungle running with Zulu's

We was looking past the struggle while life was moving so fast

You had to be shopping at Ginsu

To the top of the food group

Doing what I want and how I should too



Stepped in the waters

The water was cold

Chi in my body

But it didn't touch my soul

You family's splitting, rivalries between siblings

Bout the year Drizzy and Cole dropped

Cursing the heavens, falling out of orbit

Tryna roll this seven, tryna up my portion

What about your goals? What about your leverage?

So they don't force you into some hole

What's the meaning of my fortune meeting?

When I crack the cookie all it said was keep dreaming

When I look at my tree, I see leaves missing

Generations of harsh living and addiction

I came to visit during the seven year stint

But they wouldn't let me in because my license suspended

Now I'm scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek

It's gonna be a couple weeks before I get it

Don't use it all at once

Baby girl, your prime is about that long

Don't use it. Timing is all we got

Baby girl, your prime is about that long



Oh, hell no

I had to get back for the candy, uh

I flew for an hour than landed, oh

She live on a beautiful campus, oh

She dumb as a brick but she pass all her classes

Know what she want and she know I ain't shit but a savage, ooh

She soaking up game

Her brain is a series of pamphlets, wow

She told me a story as long as the last

She [?] with hopeless romantic

Fucking with jokers and addict

She told me everybody close to her age is full of mad shit

I said, 'Baby girl, you ain't even known enough to be jaded'

And wow, she want visual stimulation

Short attention span and little patience

I like Hennessy and record players

Teddy Pendergrass and Sammy Davis

Opposites attract. I swear, we a magnet

Don't be fucking up your scholarship

I can't help you with grants

Word to my father, my word and my balls is 'bout all that I honor

As God is my witness if you don't jump back in this bed



Don't use it all at once

Baby girl, your prime is about that long

(Do what you want, what you want, as long as you jump in the bed)

I only want to do what feels right

I have to be gone before the midterms

You making up your mind, your out of songs aren't you?

You wanted an encore, more tunes



Hey, come back to bed

Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah

Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah

Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah

Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah

I'm around a little bit of berries

You my Ju-Ju-Be

I don't need nothing to distract me

From this connectivity

You know I see it all the time

I just wanna know what's under

Before you go and get butt naked baby

I know you gotta little baggage baby

Never mind I'mma look past it

Got cans in the cooler, let me handle it baby

Two jugs I'm gonna start grasping you baby

Separation between truth and the fake

You can get a new rack for five k

You can get a rapper by Friday

You gon' have to replace these cheesecake, just save it

Can a nigga squeeze or should I just be safe

(Yeah for-sure) Tell me what it reads on the expiration date

(Well I just got them, should be good for about ten years or so)

I really feel the D when a nigga deep in the hole

But do you feel the peace when I was sucking that baby doll

I know what they say, I can give or care

They talk so much on me, I must be doing something right

I saw my son today, in the likeness of a full grown man

So I'll celebrate while I still can

On a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown

I remember where I couldn't see the point

Of stopping at the mother fucking house

Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

I came to fix up the tree thats [?]

[?] came to far



[Verse 2]

How many others have walked the route you have

You will be wise to pay attention to your own hand

I spent the whole day throwing records in the deep end

So lets celebrate while we still can



[Verse 3]

Captivated, the fruits of my family tree

Where would I be without you

What would you do without me

It would be a bare luck what could of been

So lets celebrate while we still can

On a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown

Do not be concerned about the money in your brother hand

Whats mine is your's

I thought you knew me better than that

I was under the impression that we all want the best of life

So let's celebrate while we still can

Hold on to my head, that's my little dude

Look at Kenzo, swagging like it's paw

One for the occasion and get ya good suit

Fuck your reservation

Bitch, I brought 'em all

Look at where you came from, Californication

Since a little baby skating in boogie boards

And raiding your cookie jar, my radio analog

I wanted them Nike's

Mama got me Lugz



(And all)

This one's for all the little dreamers

And the ones who never gave a fuck

I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch

Living room, watching old reruns

And who cares your daddy couldn't be here?

Mama always kept the cable on

This is the music that you gotta feel

Gave you the truth before I got a deal

No rabbit in a hat. It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield

More like a panther. Huey Newton, Bobby Seale

Word to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become?

Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?

Yeah, this is the music that you gotta feel

Used to be scared of all my fears

'Till I woke up from this nightmare

Now what become of a dreamer [?]

Now until we leave this earth

The music make your speakers burst

I always put my people first

It's deep how when I speak they say

I'm preaching like I lead a church

No proper opposition. Competition gonna need a nurse

My job as an artist is making miracles

To show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical

Crystallize the thought to make it clear to you

And make the revolution irresistable

Oh my gosh guys calm down

Stop it



Now evolution: Where it all going? Is it coming to an end or it it just beginning

There was one fellow who know'd Malibu quite well at a certain time in history

And I doubt if very few people are able to find these types of conditions again

Due to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy

But there are other areas that are magnificent, treasures of this world

And for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives, and they have a lot of excitement and adventure

They can find this way of living"
