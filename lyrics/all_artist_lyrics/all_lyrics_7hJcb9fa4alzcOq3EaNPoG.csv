Would be the one to make you blink out, I catch you like Inca

Never will there ever be another like me

Um you can play the left, cuz it ain't no right in me

Out the picture out the frame out the box I knock em all

Smack em out the park, like A Friendly Game of Baseball

Grand, slam, yes I am

Kickin up dust and I don't give a god DAMN

Cuz I'm that lyrical murderer

Pleading guilty, you know for my skills I'm about to be

Filthy large, Rage in charge

You know what's happenin don't try to play large

this ain't no Rerun, see hun, don't ya wanna be one

A cover, word to wreck ya, cause I never get my vocals

I'm loco, close to Constatanople, uhhh!

I'll make 'em go coo-coo for my Cocoa

puffin stuff, aiyyo Snoop, you're up

Let these niggaz know that niggaz don't give a fuck!



{Verse Two: Snoop Doggy Dogg}



This is just a small introduction to the G Funk Era

Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror

And I see motherfuckers tryin to be like me

Every since I put it down with the D-R-E



{Outro:}



Foamin at the mouth and waggin his tail

Searchin through the yards with a keen sense of smell

Lookin for the business in heat

And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat

We travel in packs and we do it from the back

How else can you get to the booty?

We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle

Yo motherfuckin hoes!!!

He fucked the fleas off a bitch

He shaked the ticks off his dick

And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin bone

And if there's any left over

He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home



Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin to a nigga

I ain't bullshittin, one of y'all niggaz gotta get it

With so much drama in the L-B-C

It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G

But I, somehow, some way

Keep comin up with funky ass shit like every single day

May I, kick a little something for the G's (yeah)

and, make a few ends as (yeah!) I breeze, through

Two in the mornin and the party's still jumpin

cause my momma ain't home

I got bitches in the living room gettin it on

and, they ain't leavin til six in the mornin (six in the mornin)

So what you wanna do, sheeeit

So turn off the lights and close the doors

But (but what) we don't love them hoes, yeah!

So we gonna smoke a ounce to this

G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this



{Chorus: repeat 2X}



Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice

Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)



{Verse Two:}



Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin

Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in

Now this types of shit, happens all the time

You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine

Everything is fine when you listenin to the D-O-G

I got the cultivating music that be captivating he

who listens, to the words that I speak

As I take me a drink to the middle of the street

and get to mackin to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)

She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)

Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please

Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these

At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze

{Verse Three:}



Later on that day

My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray

And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke

Shit, this ain't no joke

I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down

Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now

But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin

Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton

To serve me, not with a cherry on top

Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin up off the cot

Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes

I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'

And I'll be

We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody

We're, just some niggaz who're on the mic

And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic (right)

For all my Doggs keepin y'all in health

Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself

Cuz it's cool when ya cause a cozy conditionin

Which we create, cuz that's our mission

So listen close, to what we say

Because this types of shit happens every-day

I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin

I gave myself a strech up, a mornin yawn and

went to the bathroom to wash up

I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup

and said um ""Mirror mirror, on, the wall

Who is the top Dogg of them all?""

There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted

The mirror said, ""You are you conceited bastard""

Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef

So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf

Used Oil of Olay, cuz my skin gets pale

And then I got the file, for my fingernails

I'm true to the style on my behalf

I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath

Clean, dry, was my body and hair

I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear

for all the bitches I might take home

I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne

Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks

Threw on my white sox, with my all blue chucks

Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no

I went back in, I forgot my indo

Then I dilly (dally) I ran through an (alley)

I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)

This was a girl playin hard to get

So I said ""What's wrong?"" cuz she looked upset

She said um



It's all because of you, i'm feelin said and blue

You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days

I love you so, how much you'll never know

Cause you took your dope away from me

A-huh, a-huh, ahuh



Damn, now what was I to do

She's cryin over me and she was feelin blue

I said, ""Um, don't cry, dry your eye

And here comes your mother with those two little guys""

Her mean mother steps then says to me ""Hi!!""

Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye

Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet

Slammed the child on the hard concrete

The bitch was strong, the kids was gone

Somethin was wrong I said, ""What was goin on?""

I tried to break up, I said, ""Stop it, just leave her!""

She said, ""If I can't smoke none, she can't either!""

She grabbed my closely by my socks

So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks

But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick

They started cryin on my shoes and grabbin my dick

and sayin....



Why don't you give me a play

So we can brake it down the Long Beach way

And if you give me that okay

I'll give you all my love today

Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see

Somehow your words just hypnotize me

And I just love your jazzy ways

Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay



And on and on and on she kept goin

The bitch been around before my mother's born!

I said, ""Cheer up!"" so I gave her a hit

I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!""

She said, ""No you're not,"" then she starts cryin

I says I'm nineteen, she says, ""Stop lyin!""

I says, ""I am, go ask my mother

And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover""

Yeah, uhh, tic toc you don't stop

And to the, ah tic toc and you don't quit

I stop breathin, damn I see deamons

Dear God, I wonder can ya save me

I can't die Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby

How long will I live?

""Eternal life and forever""

And will I be, the G that I was?

""I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of

So relax your soul, let me take control

Close your eyes my son""

I'm fresh up out my coma

I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner

It's gonna take a miracle they say

For me to walk again and talk again but anyway

I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet

And everything that nigga said, came to reality

Livin like a baller loc

Havin money, and blowin hella chronic smoke

I bought my momma a Benz, and bought my Boo-Boo a Jag

And now I'm rollin in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad

Cuz when you start set-trippin, that ass mine""

Now I lay me down to sleep

I pray the lord, my soul to keep

If I should die, before I wake

I pray the lord, my soul to take



No more indo, gin and juice

I'm on my way to Chino, rollin on the grey goose

Shackled from head to toe

25 with an izzl, with nowhere to gizzo, I know

them niggaz from the other side recognize my face

Cuz it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C

Mad doggin niggaz cuz I don't care

Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair

Niggaz stare as I enter the center

They send me to a leval 3 yard, that's where I stay

Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor

Niggaz gettin they shanks, just in case the war, pops off

Cuz you can't tell what's next

My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck

And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two

I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up

Now can't nobody see me here or there

wherever I bails, I put it down on the ground

Cuz ain't shit for sale in the Coupe

And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean

And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap

in your ass, for gettin us all fucked up

Now check it, it's a callin for niggaz like Doggs

who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin like hogs

(Yes y'all) Walk the Doggs (yes y'all) Yiggy y'all

Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball



I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this

Now how many bitches must get dick?

slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby

Before you opened up your gap

I had respect for ya lady

But now I take it all back

Cause you gave me all your pussy

And ya even licked my balls

Leave your number on the cabinet

And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call

Next time I'm feelin kinda horny

You can come on over, and I'll break you off

And if you can't fuck, that day, baby

Just lay back, and open your mouth

Cause I have never

met a girl

That I love

in the whole wide world



{Verse Two: Kurupt}



Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke

I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke

I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me

Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?

I have no love for hoes

That's somethin I learned in the pound

so how the fuck am I supposed

to pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe

I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times

And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it

Pass it to the homie, now you hit it

Cause she ain't nuthin but a bitch to me

And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me

i gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention

Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt

Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfuckin house

With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth

Hoes recognize, niggaz do too

Cuz when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo

What you gon do? You really don't know

So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe

Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch

Knowin damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip

Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger

How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop

Doggy, I'm all the above

I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes

But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it

Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!

Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow

One for the money, two for the btiches

Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches

In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact

With bitches on my side, and bitches on back

So back up bitch cuz i'm strugglin, so get

off your knees and then start jugglin

A fuckin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets

All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin

I wanna see some panties droppin

I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton

(All I ever did was just use that hoe

Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)

I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news

Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes

Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs

and I smoke weed for the fuck of it

Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked

but it's manditory that I kick it

Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it

Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin

Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin

Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn

Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin

Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action

You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog

You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog

Tell when (till the early morn)

It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)

The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)



Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin cut once mo'

So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow

I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick

Till I die I'm still screamin that (bitches ain't shit)

Now i'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about

the city where I'm from, dum diddy dum

As you groove to the gangster shit

The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique

Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it

and i'm still gonna fade em all

With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin

How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin?

So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set

A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit

With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin dick

And the Compton niggaz all about to set trip

Swing it back, bring it back, just like this

And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff

And keep the motherfuckin blunt in your pocket loc

Cuz Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke

See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from

And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some

But watch the gun by my side

Because it represents me and the motherfuckin East Side

So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow

And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow

And when I get dress is Raider colors

I feel like I can do anything just gotta keep that positive energy

We got Cali movin' L.A. to the Bay connect

We a haters threat, but they ain't made it yet

California woman, palm tree pimpin'

I represent the hood where nigga's always trippin'

Shit talking, crip walking in the summertime

Dubs in the air, bangin' in the sunshine



If I had four of my favourite rappers on a track

I would expect them to have some slap that sound like hella far back

I would expect them to have some shit like this to make me reminisce

When I was up in the dope game, having my money, getting rich

When I was up in the traffic checking my trim abs with my bitch

When my and my people was having a digital beam and flippin' bricks

Talking off flips with faulty chips, throwing our weight around

Thumpers fresh out of the box in case we gotta get down

It's your life, but you don't wanna deal with it

So you talk a lot of shit in the comments

Like a you a Judge, you don't work for the government (No you don't)

Don't complain, you need to stop your bitchin'

You too negative, you sound like a politician

You need positive vibes, some West Coast sunshine

We like to watch it go down and have a good time

It's nothing like a California sunset

With a bad little chick that you wanna hit

And even if you ain't from here, you can get a lot of game from here

When you tryin' to make a good impression

Do your very best is the lesson

Unless you all salad, no dressin'

I don't like shit half-done

From a job to a piece of filet Mignon

You got to give a full effort

And pray to the Sheppard

You don't get shotgun peppered

Keep your work and your place separate

You know you got a record, and your past is kinda chequered

You got to work double as hard to get half as far, as black as we are

I'm black as the tar, but I'm a star

I'm down as fuck, and up to par (Yeah)

I might cuss, yell or vent

But you know Ice Cube give a thousand percent

Niggas so impressed by other niggas raps

But the thing you know best is ""Bought a TEC"" is cap

'Cause you could get jacked on site if you ain't precise

Figure-four fistfights, make the homies take flight

Flight, take off on you, like I ain't goin' to work today

Most of your favorite rappers pussy, I know it hurt to say

My mama told me hold my brother down, 'cause she was workin' late

My cousin turned Muslim the minute hе beat that murder case

I'vе been all around the world and I've been doin' my thing-thing

Some say that I'm the reason while y'all gangbang

While you was in grade school, I'm takin' faze full

Crippin' is international, so now we gettin' paid, fool

They tryna rig the culture, you could say they vultures

You dead sauce, so why the fuck you reachin' for that holster?

Gangbangin' is a test, the stress'll give you an olser

Snatch that chain off your neck, don't care if that shit a choker

Cuz see Cripped out, why you so seasick?

Cold on a ho', I leave that bitch in me, me

Call me and Dave East, nigga, that's what we win

Harlem thirties with that LBC shit

People what we get, avoidin' the preset

I'm hard as the cement, we robbed him for three bricks

Avoid niggas that every time they call me, they need shit

I'm Billy D smooth, blue flag and DG Crip

Ricky Ross, Frank Lucas, bumpin' your Tucky Williams

All of 'em had the crown, but none of 'em took it with 'em

So it's our job to do what they couldn't do

Hardwired for this shit, one, two, one, two



So if you're lookin' for some real G's

Let me show you where my niggas at (Where my niggas at?)

And if you're lookin' for the bubble gum (Yessir)

Holler at me (holler at me), I'll holler back



Shooter told me he gotta clap if he catch it

Balenciagas on, all-black, lookin' like Sketchers

We ain't in the foreign, but she never seen a Tesla

Mama did my laundry, fam, my .40 in my dresser

Niggas said they gon' DP me, I shot the fake

Now I'm gettin' head, I'm special ed, I got it made

This hot grave got me in L.A., like 'Wop wave

I found out that crime pays, your shit is not John Blaze on

Hustle like Ricky Ross, lot of talk, holocaust

I'ma get one off and then go and see the boss

You's a bitch they play with, like toys

Get your drawers slapped off you, like the lil' homie Fatboy do niggas

We group niggas, then we shoot niggas

HMC, DPG, Kurupt and Snoop, nigga

I repped my set, now I just do it in the booth, nigga

From the dirt, I be with smurps, we all in blue, nigga



So if you're lookin' for some real G's

Let me show you where my niggas at (Where my niggas at?)

And if you're lookin' for the bubble gum (Yessir)

Holler at me (holler at me), I'll holler back

Pushing on

Gotta keep pushing on

Mm

You gotta keep push—



Who remember growing up eating Corn Flakes?

Spend the night at granny house 'cause momma on a date

So you ate what you ate and you ate it quick

'Cause you knew your grandma, she ain't play that shit

Paw Paw, he stayed in another house

With another woman, she a brick house

Growing up fast was a shit show

It's a fеw things I learned from the gеt go

A few folks in my fam fell down

Then they got they feet back on solid ground

And came back around and showed me how to fail

See there's a lesson every time a nigga take a L

Dead or in jail, that's the fairytale

What I know about it? I know it very well

That's why I don't stop, won't stop, can't quit

Keep pushing making that dope shit



You gotta keep push—

Through the good and the bad

Whether happy or sad

Tryna stand as a man

You gotta keep pushing on

We will see what they do

Keep your head up and move

Love will always come through (Yeah, a'ight Snoop)

You gotta keep push—



Through hell or high water, keep my confidence on the level

Let my family support me, it could be me against whoever

Say I'm cancelled, I say even better

Man, who gon' tell 'em?

Your opinion doesn't validate me, I been the shit

In my hood, can't get no better, could never intimidate me

Trap music say we geniuses, politics say we crazy (Shit)

Man, I was selling Ye when Brenda had a baby

When nothing but hip-hop could come and save me

And I just sat there on the pavement

Tryna find a way to make some payment

Had first dibs when they came in

Selling pounds of reefer was strange then (What?)

For eight thousand they gave me ten of 'em

Drove to make it make twenty off the same ten

All our lives we were taught to just hold the pain in (For real)

Imitate Neanderthals and copy cavemen

Can't teach a man how to make it with a handout

Fuck fitting in, keep pushing until you standout



You gotta keep push—

Through the good and the bad

Whether happy or sad

Tryna stand as a man

You gotta keep pushing on

We will see what they do

Keep your head up and move

Love will always come through

A kick in the freezer, a 40 in the stove

I cried in the trap when I lost Quinn Coleman

They couldn't talk peace with me. They tried, and I was like, ""Nigga, that's schoolyard."" You can't find a home in my generation that put in more work than me. You may find one or two that put in as much as me, but you ain't gon' find none that put in more than me. And I'm here to tell you that shit was worthless, bro. When they try to peace, I don't wanna peace. Look where I'm at. This shit ain't cool, bro. Crazy part of this, you go this way to me, two steps that way, you got 60.

This feel like a cocaine song, my bowl game strong

Baby say my stroke game long

She on everything, move and choose up, who ya choosin'?

In it to win it, get it crackin', now how ya doin'?

Maneuverin' while we movin'

Smoky in this motherfucker while we crusin'

We off the coast of France with a host of friends

Coastal winds get close again, you the most advanced

Take my hand, go with the flow

Do what I say and walk it out and pay attention

Don't you give it away

And once we make that clear

I'ma tell you what you wanna hear, yeah

Uh, shawty my lil boo thing, put her in that Mulsanne

CREAM like Wu-Tang, yeah (Woo)

Got in that mad shit 'cause I'm rich and handsome

Diamonds on me dancin', yeah (Oh yeah)

Smokin' on exotics, say she from the Tropics

It look like she brought it, don't care though

Fuckin' fix the stitches in her hair though

Fuck yo last nigga, I know you used to the middle



Baby, don't deny what you here for

Wetter than the dimes on my earlobes

Lookin' in my eyes like it's tenfold (Tenfold)

Wanna knock boots like Timbo's

All up in your water, I'm so nautical with it (Ayy)

I see what I want and I gotta go get it (Ayy)

Once we get goin', I won't stop 'til you finish

But the main i-, but the main idea

Yo dogg, niggas always asking me
""Is the muthafuckin DPGC still together?"" 
Niggas gon ask me
""Dogg ya'll still together, I heard ya'll broke up like the fat boys."" 
Nigga what, nigga this Dogg Pound for life nigga

We ain't going nowhere nigga

In matter of fact, you actin foolish right now with all that shit you kick

Nigga everywhere I go niggas be actin foolish

And uh, I'm a deal with that shit DPG style



[Kurupt]

I'm a rider, the first local stock pilot

Now what the fuck made you think the DP divided

Moving on up to the top of the map

Because gangsta will be here till the curl comeback

I'm moving down to block D, me and my homies 

The Dogg Pound would rock overseas, immense degrees

No bitch niggas in the circle

Beat a nigga in his face till his fuckin eyes turn purple



[Daz Dillinger]

I told myself watch out for my family and health

I got my shit together, got the gauge up shelf

Knowing the rules have chose to hang out with the dummies and fools

Old school Poda Dada that I knew from way back to school

Attitude shitty, kept it raw and gritty

Uncut, me and my dawgs fuckin it up

What up



[Snoop Dogg]

Fuckin it up, fuckin it up for life nigga, Dogg Pound, ya heard

If I hear another nigga talking about what he gon do, to who

To me and my crew, nigga the grey and the blue

You through, you knew you shouldn't have done that

Now how the fuck you figure that we wasn't gon comeback

The D, the P, the G to C

Westcoast's finest and I'm a put that on me

See niggas been rappin but they ain't sayin shit

Nigga shut the fuck up, get off my dick



Chorus

Don't be foolish x2



[Daz]

Hook

You see you don't wanna fuck with us

Knowing how we throw it out, the sucka niggas want to imitate us

Cause all we wanna do is put the G right back in you

Yeah worry about your muthafuckin punk ass crew

And we keeps it gangsta fool, thats gangsta, keep it gangsta fool



[Snoop Dogg]

Trip, we got more dough than rock up, more niggas to lock up

You niggas need to strap up or pack up

See because this world we live in is crazy, and the people they so sick

See why I keeps it gangsta and I ride with the sickest clique

And when it comes to gun play, hell yeah we the quickest biach



[Daz Dillinger]

And oh my momma and my daddy, grandpapa and my granny 

Homeboy you can't fuck with this



[Kurupt]

Smooth when we come through

The DP when we come through the gangstas is in the house

And all you muthafuckin niggas and you muthafuckin bitches 

Get a muthafuckin dick in your mouth

I'm a gangsta I thought you knew, G'd up, grey and blue

Dippin through on the coop, made you blue

Kurupt and Snoop, Daz in the muthafuckin bomb ass clique

We gangstas nigga, laid back thinkin I tell you how it is in the hood

Where all my homies at, straps in Cadillacs

Hittin switches like e'yday, livin like the G way like e'yday, DPG-C



[Daz]

Hook



[Snoop Dogg]

Chorus x4



Just bullshittin man this dude done told me the Dogg Pound broke up

Wait till I catch that nigga, I'm a beat him down

Wait till I, wait till I catch em

Dogg Pound ain't gon never break up cause that's favorite group

They gon keep on commin out with albums

Wait till I catch this nigga, he lied to me

This did done tell me some stupid bullshit

Wait till I catch that muthafucker

Man don't be foolish and believe that shit

Shit man, don't be foolish

Don't be foolish, nigga

And my soul just running away to you, and I want you to grab my hand and hold me
I know, I know, I know
One of these days, I'm gonna run away to you
Yes I am

Whoah, yes I am



Make me wanna run away

Pack my bags and get away

On my knees at night, I pray

That we will live another day

You always got something to say



In the kitchen with my kinfolk, cookin'

They say the devil always show up when you're not lookin'

That's why I'm doing God's work

I'll hook 'em with the scripture

Then bring it all to life so everyone can get the picture

I'm withcha

See, this is for my folks who hold the fence up

The preachers, ministers, deacons, ushers and the sisters

My granny used to say ""Give us our daily bread""

She put it in my heart, and now it's in my head



Make me wanna run away

Pack my bags and get away

On my knees at night, I pray

That we will live another day

You always got something to say



I'm at the park, playin' ball with the children

Providing the league so I can help restore the feeling

It's a blessing to give back, so let's keep giving it

Walk by faith, and showing how we livin' it

Lovin' it, avoiding the hate

Shout out to Ruth for giving birth to Nate

That's my homeboy's momma

We was raised in the Church

We take God with us

Do right, don't fight

Or try to [?] with us

No weapon formed against me shall prosper

And that's fact, truth mane

The Gospel

Sittin' on the corner, tryna figure the fall

You done got too high, now you're feeling so low

I'm just a nobody, tryna tell everybody

About somebody who can save anybody

I remember what my Grandma said, ""Give us our daily bread""

It's in my heart, and my head



Make me wanna run away

Pack my bags and get away

On my knees at night, I pray

That we will live another day

You always got something to say"

Saved my soul and he set me free

Now I'm praising the lord above

I never thought that I could change

Until he saved a wretch like me

Now I'm here to tell the story

So that that you will be set free!



Well once upon a time in the Church of God

There was sinners and saints

Evens to odds

Wills and won'ts

Will be sittin' up front

Gettin' the sermon up close

Neither, none, best 20 minutes or less

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

I'm shootin' like I just started

But I'ma walk up in this motherfucker cold-hearted

I know you niggas don't see me as much as you'd like

'Cause I'm out gettin' money when I'm rockin' the mic

I'm a long way from Locus Ave, my locas have

Been there with me through the good and bad

Know look, let me reminisce, and twist a fuckin' blunt to spark

I got put on, '84 at King Park

Shottin' hoops with [?]

With the bumblebees, real east-side G's

Then go to [?] and ball out for any black ass

And wait for all the bitches at Poly to get outta class

I'm poppin' at 'em from a distant, but I'm persistent

That's some 20 crip shit

See I'm a dub motherfucker and all y'all know

So if you're with it, let's get it 432-O, come on

She didn't even notice me

At the concert backstage wit' Jodeci

She had a new look, a new face, a new drum beater

And from the looks, I could tell she had been under the needle

We do it just it just like this that back (back)



They tried to run a game on a nigga

Word to P.E, shame on a nigga

I never paid attention

Did I forget to mention

I started up cooking up the cavi in the kitchen

Then I graduated, matter of fact I made it

Reinstated but still kept it gang related

I traveled the globe, private jets, and Versace robes

Penthouse suites, what about phony hoes?

Tanqueray glasses, smoke fills the air

And hoes with fat asses playing truth or dare

No bizaar, what a lovely pair

And they all came here just to fuck wit a player

Anytime I wanna jam, shit I'm runnin' through these hoes

Like a pack at the Coliseum

Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, and Bo Diddley

If you know like I know, you come and fuck wit me, fo' real

And see I'm only here to rock wit ya

I'm talking about growing old with you

Sitting on the porch

Going through storage looking through old photos

When I used to rock the Death Row logo

And you was right there, you still here

And that's just how I feel right now for you

So you can take these words as what I say

What I mean

Don't think I'm playing, I'm saying it's truth

This is a lil' something from me to you

Flashy back

Trying to get the passion back

First girl I ever fell in love with

On some East Side long beach dove shit

You wouldn't understand it, even if I told you

Baby boo, nigga really love you

As clear as the sky is blue

Ain't nobody in this whole world ride for Snoop, but you

You're so, so

Home of the Wook, Wok and Gunplay

A lot of homies shoot to J

But most of 'em prefer to shoot the K

Yeah, that's the good life

And where we come from, loc, that's the hood life

Where you mama and daddy

Told to set up out the room while they swingin' the caddy

That's on the set, tats on they neck

Swing it out and let it up and bang that out

Ridin' on bikes but they came with they flags on the end

The Miles Davis of gangbangin' and crack slangin'

Drivin' a fresh rock, run 'em with blocks in 'em

Now your homies at your funeral

Plottin' on some get back

But you can't get back 'cause nigga, you dated

Another sad gangsta story

And usually ones with the territory

No nuts, no glory

No pain, no gain

Life for a nigga growin' up in the game

This slangin' thang

Drinkin', sell a lil' cocaine

Get locked up for a minute now we in it to win it

Now everybody know me

They watchin' the makings of a real OG



Yeah, they say if you watch somethin' long enough, you'll be comin'

You know, they say imitation is the best form of flattery

That's what I was told

A lot of niggas is imitatin' me 'cause real gangsta shit

You ain't cut from it

You dig?



Yeah, scarin' all the white folk

While stayin' on the right note

And you can quote me if you want to

Don't say what you will do, nigga, what you gon' do?

Caught him on Imperial left five in his chest

Survive in the west

It's everyday cycle, you never know what might go blam

And how you like me now?

Crip 'til you slip, Mr. Big Bow Wow

Yeah, it's my chance to prance

I got ants in my pants and I needs to dance

I go for broke, no joke

Call a few plays then break the huddle

Check that D, they in the zone [?]

I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80

Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady



I can send a missile

I got my head on a swivel, swivel

I got my head on a swivel

Eyes peeled when I wiggle

I got my head on a swivel, swivel

I got my head on a swivel

This is not a starter pistol (No, no)

I got my head on a swivel, swivel (Yeah)

I got my head on a swivel

If you need me just whistle

I got my head on a swivel, swivel

I got my head on a swivel



If you play wing back, slot end, or receiver

You got to outwork your opponent or you won't receive a

Pass from the quarterback cause he's under pressure

They get a couple 1DB's about to press up

Looking apart from the start, on the dress up

Coach on the play, I'm hoping that he don't mess up

Ayy back up off me, you playing me close

You bout to be hot buttered on a breakfast toast

I rock it out and find my way into the endzone

A couple cheerleaders want to be in my friendzone

I tell 'em ""Cool,"" I keep my head in the game

Cause I'm ahead of the game and I'm a veteran man



Call a few plays then break the huddle

Check that D, they in the zone [?]

I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80

Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady



I can send a missile

I got my head on a swivel, swivel

There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew

About something we did or supposed to do

You might not heard of it yet or maybe you have

But when I first heard it all I did was laugh

I used to get angry and all uptight

You can say what you want just spell my name right

Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house

But that's not what the rumor was all about

So if you like to hate tell all your friends

And if you don't wait until you see me again

This way I can hear it from the horses mouth

Right then and there we can straighten it out

Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarah

Cara told Bibi and she told [?]

And [?] talking to her mam

And somehow my nigga [?]

He told somebody new from town

They called me up and put me down

Now the whole damn show is been changed around

I roll a motherfucking fat back to myself
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it

Gracefully gazing unto the sky

A lot of people smoke just to get by

But I see things much differently

Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically

Put it in a letter so you let it be

One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree

If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J

And not have to answer to nobody

I live my life like it's a party

So let's go cuz



So go ahead and blaze up

Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)

So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)

I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep

I got me a sweet

I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police

You think you could smoke like my & Snoop, don't try to compete

I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up

If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up

Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity

If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me

I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe

You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so

You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow

Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong

Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song

And do it however you please, you please

Today's the day to smoke weed



So go ahead and blaze up

Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)

So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)

Damn, a pound ain't really nothing now

Remember smoking with my cousin

Now we all Raw cone stuffing

Enough to wake neighbors up

KK my favorite flavor

And you ain't gotta ask cause we major

I smoke like them old players

Only put it in the paper

I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me

Known to keep the room cloudy

Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open

The best trees I be smoking

Smell it through the bag so it's potent

Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice

Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it

A pothead but I be focused

And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit

Only the best what you dealing with

It's legal now, everybody's doing this



So go ahead and blaze up

Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)

So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)

Fuck the police, from a black man's point of view

And I don't fuck around

I don't wanna hurt you but I will spurt you

And send you back to the earth, you

Came from, game gun

Same one, that I used in another galaxy

Actually, it's all fact to me

If I ruled the world would it come back to me?

Black to me, with my hand on that thang thang

I'm from the home of the brave, land of the gang bang

All you hear is brrr brrr brr in the streets

People grip and they eat just to settle they beefs

Now you getting chased by police

You running to the west, running to the east

But the problem is you under the beast

Brr brr brr - now your brother's deceased

We need peace

Not brrr in the streets

The brrr in Iraq lasts for weeks

Wack rappers, I'm crushing these creeps

Every time I spit they get weak

I take you back to the days when the telephone used to brrring

I'm reading the sacred script

What, where, why or when?

Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen

While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in

By any means necessary

Peeking out the window

Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders

Thinking how the rap game was

I dig, I dug, I push, I shove

Yeah I fell out of love

But it ain't no thing

Telephone ring

They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang

So I try to show the little homies different things

How to diversify, and change different lanes

Learn to read a little, exercise your brain

Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game

Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't

Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace

The honourable [?]

Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep

Cause it's truth

What's that? You don't like that?

Well we fight back. And we'll be right back



Let us begin

What, where, why or when?

Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen

They want the meaning of V-A-P-O-R-S
Now the meaning of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be down when you're down and out

Now when you established and got a lot of money

Everybody wants to be your buddy and honey

Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers

(Here comes the vapors)

Can you feel it, nothing can save ya

For this is the season for catching the vapors

And since I got time, what I'm gonna do

Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew

Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records

""Never Leave Me Alone"", ""Ain't No Fun"", now check it

Back in the days before Nate Dogg began

He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam

The type of female with fly Gucci gear

She haad a big [?] with a weave in her hair

When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess

Talking about, ""Baby please, you out here serving stress""

Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer

The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her

But now he sport boots that match with his suits

Push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cute

And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and

Be coming round the Pound every single weekend

To get his beeper number she be begging please

Dying for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors



He caught the vapors

She caught the vapors

They caught the vapors

He caught the vapors

She caught the vapors

They caught the vapors



I got a little cousin that's kinda plain

He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang

A mellow type of fellow that's laid back

But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that

I remember when he used to scrap every day

When my auntie would tell him he would never obey

He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied

And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside

Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad

They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had

They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster

Or either in jail, or someone would shank him

But now he's grown up to their surprise

D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide

Now the same people that didn't like him as a child

Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle



He caught the vapors

She caught the vapors

They caught the vapors

He caught the vapors

She caught the vapors

They caught the vapors



I got another homie from tha L-B-C

Known to y'all as DJ Warren G

He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse

{scratching} and all that mess

I remember when we first started to rock

He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop

He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted

Said ""Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted""

Now my homie Warren still tried

On and on and on til the like break of dawn

To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick

But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped

Now for the year after Regulate

Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight

He walked into the same record shop as before

And the boss be like ""Warren, welcome to my store""

Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it

Damn it feels good to see people up on it

Cause I remember when at first they wasn't

Now guess what they caught since he busting

The vapors



He caught the vapors

She caught the vapors

They caught the vapors

He caught the vapors

She caught the vapors

They caught the vapors



Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg

I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog

When I was a teenager I tried to be down

But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound

I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, ""Can I be down champ?""

They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp

After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set

I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest

When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait

Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight

I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music

They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi

But now things switched from West to East

""Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?

We used to see Daz back in the day""

It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

You caught the vapors



He caught the vapors

She caught the vapors

They caught the vapors

He caught the vapors

She caught the vapors

They caught the vapors"

I'm tatted and matted, added, that's 4 to the 4

Now we say, well is he good or he great?

Don't even wait, just clean the food off your plate

Say your grace, for the life that you make

Now he butted and skutting, cutting the knife in the steak

Wow, I'm and out of TI, all about it

Cause I handle my BI, CI, I see you

Wanna get a flair, no faking

Let's take it cause I love this shit



This why they show me mad love around the world

This why they show me mad love around the world

This why they show me mad love around the world

This why they show me mad love around the world



Now when I'm on your, my spirit's unpure

And there's no cure for sure but I adore

I walk around the town and I explore

I'm greeted by 100 fans at my front door

Encore is what they want, much more

I'm smooth like suede with a touch of valore

On the rocks, Ciroc, glass and I pour

Snoop Dogg is the shit, get your ass on the floor

You can choose best and 2 step to this

Smoked up cause my weed is the shit

Take down and break down the verse

Put the S in your chest when worst comes to worst



This why they show me mad love around the world

This why they show me mad love around the world

This why they show me mad love around the world

This why they show me mad love around the world



Yeah all around the world

Big Bub, Snoop Dogg

Real love

From the streets to the suites

Everywhere I go

Everywhere I been

Love, love

Go head, go head, go head

Say that, say that, say that

Oh yeah they do

Another classic

That's real love right there man

All around the world

Shout out to the whole globe

Love y'all, nasty piece"

Born to be a legend

1996, I beat a 187 (murder was the case)

80 million sold, and I ain't check the records

Checked a couple rappers, told 'em not to test me

Ask me who am I? Motherfucking legend

50 bitches naked

Nike ain't my preference

Khaki with the Chucks

Now look how they dressing

Perfected my profession

Someone call the reverend (Nate Dogg nigga)

Bury me alive, living legend

Even if I die, living Legend

Look at my reflection

Ain't no second guessing

Always be a legend

Look, big dog, six broads, don't matter to me

You knew niggas look madder than me

Came up with the Doc, been around the world with 'Pac

Don't compare another rapper to me

When I came and kicked them buildings over

Swear I always knew I'd never be the same

Was born to be a motherfucking legend

I ain't never do it for no fucking fame

Motherfucking legend

You know what I'm repping

20 million, 20 years ago

Cuh, you was like 7

You ain't gotta like it

You ain't seen a playa lay this way

Wit a attitude, like - and ya don't stop
Aficionado, so fashionable

Wit a confident swagger, international

Game so tight the girls had to go

And you don't stop!



[Verse - Beanie Sigel]

Hah! sicka than your average

Money too long can't stash it

In the closet or the mattress

Paper, stretch like elastic

Checks from advances, the bank can't cash it

So the price for that, never ask it

Just sign my name or pop plastic

Hating ass cops wanna harrass em

Searching for a glock in the pocket of his fashion

Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses

And they left breast (yes!)

Let's get dressed and toast to the occasion

Cops couldn't page em, flow so amazing, hot like cajun

You fucking wit the champ

Pop corks on champ' like I just took the chip

Nigga took the stand when he coulda took the 5th

Yeah eat a dick wit AIDs on the tip, keep my name off ya lips

Not guilty!



[Chorus]



[Verse - Beanie Sigel]

I said I'm sicka than your average

Keep three shooters like the Mavericks

Short to the point like Nash is, fucking wit a savage

Niggaz press they luck, get bucked like ashes

Three piece suits, linen fabrics

Three quarter croc, sharper than a pastor

B Sig bring the light to the masses

Of these rap bastards, who gives street passes

One shooting can lead to three caskets

Jump suits, state boots, at least three stabbings

You softer than a Reebok Classic

Folding under pressure when confronted by them badges

I was taught stay low and keep blasting

Po only know questions that was answered

Keep a number on the high price lawyer

It's five ways now days, everybody saw ya



[Chorus]



[Bridge - repeat 2x]

[SD] Now let's toast to the man, that when he get out

That he gon do them thangs that he rap about

A true playa Pha-real [Pharrell]

[BS] Haters stay out my face

And know that thing still by my waist



[Verse - Beanie Sigel]

Once again I'm sicker then 'em all

Niggaz see C's start shitting in they drawers

When I kick in the door, stop the blood clot crying

Wipe the piss off the floor

The ape is back, my gate is cracked

My jumpsuit and my cuffs is off

Yeah I'm back on them bricks

Raise your cups and raise your glass

And let's toast to the boy B Mack, yeah I'm back in the mix!

You see I'm mean with the 16, yes you are

Got a big old house, bout 50 cars

And the ones I drive, what a hell of a ride

Built for a player when I lean to the side

My shit so dank, my paint is wet

Lacs, Impalas, and Corvettes

Wagoners, saggin' here

Nigga not braggin' here, but lets be clear

My cars, they hot, my paint is wet

So I figured the funk, point blank man this nigga a hoe

Look around, smash down, sit your ass down little class clown

Let me get back on the highway, try my way

This is the fly, way, Mass appeal, cash the deal

Never will I motherfuckin' crash the wheel

Pass the feel, the tank with the drank in the cup

Look baby girl, thats whats up

Slide by my side bitch house in the cut

With my 9 by side when I side in the cut

I shake I shook in, peep out the window, niggas still lookin'

When in doubt, flash that 9 get in and out

Take my time while dippin' out, then bang my set while spinnin' out

My cars, they hot, my paint is wet

Let me raise mine, bang for the Fo'

Pop that shit nigga break it down low

They say the stage with more lights

Can the nigga re-write the whole game

She tried to dodge the blue ride

Big race tires we ride the whole ride

We bringin' it live to your side

You gonna stand outside or you gonna hop inside?

She said cool can my girls come?

We gon' drank, smoke then fuck some

It was 2, 3, 4, then 5, tall short thick and fine

And they all enjoyed the ride, Dogg could you bring us all back again

I love it when you put it in my back again

Fill up in your car then you back again

Cause your cars are hot, your paint is wet

Your bitches, they're bad, thats probably why y'all mad

Your cars, they're hot, your paint is wet

I got a white one, a black one, a yellow one

A green one, a blue one, a red one

You could even float with me if you want to

Cause thats how a real player ride

We ride like we ride

You wanna get inside, well lets ride

You wanna get inside, well lets ride

The world is getting ablaze, yeah

Run away, run away with me

Come and play, come and play with me

Run away, yes do the day with me

Let's escape, yes do the day with me



I don't understand why do they live so violently

Let's get closer to the sun, where we're meant to be

Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?

Come on baby no time to waste, run away with me



You like the way that I dress (you love the way that I see)

You love the things that I do (yes but I love that you are free)

You love the way we think (for people everywhere)

We're approaching the brink but who cares

The world is getting ablaze, yeah

Ich can't find on sis sing
Oh, mein God, ich love a conna, sing con me
Ich swear to God, dizzy und busted
You know my story, I did a lot of ballin'

Been around the world, a lot of girls call it

A lot of pennies fallin' out the air and on the stage

If my label's a book, you couldn't miss a page

But none of that really matter when I cut my eyes and roll

See 'em pass by, I nearly dropped my phone

I'm like Snoopie Bree, cush er'where I go

I couldn't think straight, pimping was all alone

Should have seen her walk like a model do

If this was twitter, I would follow you

Open your (???) let doggy take yo hand

I'm seeing weddin' rings, call Diddy, lets make the plans

She got me high, I don't wanna leave

I see her walk best, but she's something to see

And now I'm on the flame, feelin' so ashamed

I didn't catch her name, I call 'er Miss Everything



Tell me, have ya seen her (Seen her)

Got something, pretty face and big brown eyes

Smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle (Struggle)

Make the ground pile up (?)

I keep runnin' the tune at her

But the numbers neva have exchanged

Everytime, every city, Miss Everything

Miss Everything



You know my story, I watched a lot of crowd

Sold millions of records, I love my fans so loud

I got a thousand cars and all the perks of being

A real superstar, I live super-far

But none of that really matters when I cut my eyes in Spain

She walked in to me, like you did yo thang

And that Spanish accent, the one I love so much

She look like an angel, one I wanted to touch

I blink my eye for a second and then she disappear

When I see that pretty woman, I felt like Richard Gere

Ball on, ain't neva been one of that watch and pass

Unless we in a room, and I leave and they watch that ass

But baby smth else, somehow I didn't speak

I been here so long, maybe I reached my peak

And now I'm in the plane, fellin' total shame

I didn't catch her name, I call 'er Miss Everything



Tell me, have ya seen her (Seen her)

Got something, pretty face and big brown eyes

Smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle (Struggle)

Make the ground pile up (?)

I keep runnin' the tune at her

But the numbers neva have exchanged

Everytime, every city, Miss Everything

Miss Everything



Yeah, you know my story, I seen a lot of hoes

A lot of gold diggers, Luda' call 'em ""goes""

I don't call 'em back, and that's just how it goes

Most people call me Snoopy, or S to double O

But none of that really matters when I was in NY

I had a show at the Guard, you know, up at Corse

That's when I seen 'er, from the distance, she smile at (???)

Now, everything I learned in the game told me she chose

And I don't miss a beat, this time I gotta speak

She look magnificent, like smth to eat

Ergo, I can't let her go, I made my way through the crowd

Lets get outta here, head off for Lee Child(?)

A lot of stars in place, Doggy set the mood

I'm like ""I like yo style"", she's like ""I like yours too""

Before I hit this plane, I gotta know yo name

She smiled as if she came, call me Miss Everything



Tell me, have ya seen her (Seen her)

Got something, pretty face and big brown eyes

Smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle (Struggle)

Make the ground pile up (?)

I keep runnin' the tune at her

The molly red, coming back home with the bread

Handle my metal, Hansel & Gretel

Cheese, keys, breeze, it's settled

This shit hot like a pot



Niggas hit the pavement

When I come through slow

In a six-four hanging out the window

Niggas hit the pavement

When I fall through the club

Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs

Niggas hit the pavement

DF on the beat

If you don't work then you don't eat

Niggas hit the pavement

Real true statement

Grind 'til they pay me

Real niggas hit the pavement



Yea! Fuckin' Snoop lovable

Yea, I'm searchin' through time and space

To find the funk

And reconnect the middle ship

Yea, and now this is quite some journey

Seven days of funk, baby



Niggas hit the pavement

When I come through slow

In a six-four hanging out the window

Niggas hit the pavement

When I fall through the club

Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs

Niggas hit the pavement

DF on the beat

If you don't work then you don't eat

Niggas hit the pavement

Real true statement

Grind 'til they pay me

Real niggas hit the pavement



Droppin C's for the G's

Hopin' my peas, battin' my eyes while crossin' my T's

Me and Dane spittin' game, doin' shows overseas

Forty years old, have no fuckin' enemies

Check checker bo readear letter mo wetter

If you knew better then you'd probably do better

Act like you know

Know not, better know better



'Cause niggas hit the pavement

When I come through slow

In a six-four hanging out the window

Niggas hit the pavement

When I fall through the club

Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs

Niggas hit the pavement

DF on the beat

If you don't work then you don't eat

Niggas hit the pavement

Real true statement

Grind 'til they pay me

Real niggas hit the pavement



I live with a maid

I won't be happy 'til my whole team paid

From my mama to my daddy, to my kids, to my wife

And all my kinfolks in the afterlife

I'm chillin' on the moon like man tonight

Big Snoop Dogg got 'em actin like

Money is the key to end all your wrongs

Mo money, mo hoes



Niggas hit the pavement

When I come through slow

In a six-four hanging out the window

Niggas hit the pavement

When I fall through the club

Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs

Niggas hit the pavement

DF on the beat

If you don't work then you don't eat

Niggas hit the pavement

Real true statement

Grind 'til they pay me

Real niggas hit the pavement"

Faden away

And I can't go another day

You make it hard to stay away

Girl you've got me faden away

Girl you've got me faden away

And ain't no other words to say

You make it hard for me to stay

Girl you've got me faden away

Faden away



In my mind, it's all about you

I don't know what to do

'Cause you have got me confused

We talking on the phone

We fussing fight you 'bout that lightening

I just wanna love you right, love you right



Faden away

And I can't go another day

You make it hard to stay away

Girl you've got me faden away

Girl you've got me faden away

And ain't no other words to say

You make it hard for me to stay

Girl you've got me faden away

Faden Away



Make time, make love, that's what we make

Looking nowadays, looking like it's gonna fade

See me, will you see here G soul

If he lose baby he gonna gain another dough

What a brother know, keep it on the low

That's what my grandma said it suppose to go

Feel the same, we toast and post it

And if it all work soft then we casper the ghost

Me and damn phone we capture the phone

Collusion, illusion, set it all foe

Plan with me, for your best, let it all go

The beach and the wind you blow



[Repeat x2]

Faden away

And I can't go another day

You make it hard to stay away

Girl you've got me faden away

Girl you've got me faden away

And ain't no other words to say

You make it hard for me to stay

Girl you've got me faden away

Faden away



It's so hard to stay with you girl

It's even harder to play with you girl

It's so hard to stay with you girl

And even harder to play with you girl

A new fish or a new jumbo shrimp

Pulling the case ain't no chasin' me, or replacin' me, no lacin' me

I hold up the whole broom, they can see

And the kush is the reason we dank it g'

And spanky beat, in my sack

Where doctor [?] put us right back on fact

Now we can smoke to that, I spoke to cat flat

Bout the other shit connected

Uncle jim's army and we back here protected

The funk bang, never be the same, burning up kush

Let me let me tell you what your worth is

Wake up in the morning with a purpose

Only you can make me happy, surface

East side, Long Beach baby, turf shit

The place where I murk that

13 on the scene, getting bent back

With a whole lot of snake venom

Used to steal, now ladies at the highway center

Up early getting shit started

Back flippin, trippin tippin, crippin cold hearted

Way before I got high then

Bought up about 50's from the pie men

Heat out the motherfuckin fryin pan

Lil kids love Snoop, fuck grimin

I'm a vet on the set

I ain't lyin man, let me show you how fly I am

Hatin the school, lay in the pool and I stay in the cool

Young low, I ain't playing with fools

Reset, repeat, unlock and we cop the heat

And it ends so fast

Spend yo cash and we'll get in yo ass

Now that question is this and that

Are you really in love with that bitch now?

Another man's trash is another man's treasure

What's yo measure?

Lookin at you straight from a falcon eye

On my balcony askin how can I



(Hook)

How can I love somebody else?

When I can't love myself enough to know

Bad 4 me

A lot of G's start snitchin

Bad 4 me

Fuckin with you hood rat bitches

Bad 4 me

All that you had for me, is all bad 4 me



(Verse)

Cuz I used to run but struck out down the way

Cold thing is to call where yo phone stay

Told me he was up for release

It's been about a dub since cuz in the streets

Yea Lo, shit done changed

Long beach then it flipped, crazy deranged

And everybody's selling out

Word of mouth, the OG tell em now

I drove near the other day

To chop some game, my big homie down the way

It's sorta hard for me to run away

Step out my car and no gun today, andale

I press my luck, if I get stuck

Well then that's what's up

Looking at you straight from the falcon eye

On my balcony I, asking how can I?



(Hook x2)

How can I love somebody else?

When I can't love myself enough to know

Buckle up and take a ride in my passenger seat
Put your feet to the pavement, look at my behavement
See how, the be how, and trip what I was raised with
Can't no nigga fade me, bangin' like the 80s

Had a lot of money with a handful of babies

Boy, this shit is crazy - straight from the turf

Hit the red alert and ask Mack it better work

So I slide to the spizot, right behind the lizide

And get a bag of pizot, avoid getting hizocked

Cause hizabs is on me, they want me, but I can't fold

I'm an Eastside rider, I was born to roll

Never tell to be told, never sell to be sold

On the level, what a rebel, boy, I stay in control

And I'mma let you ride with me so you can see how it goes

And we'll hit the track and let you peep out some hoes

And if you like what you see, and you agree with me

Then you enjoy my perspective of the LBC

Kick back and roll up, and mix the Henny with the soda

We ridin' like we flyin' through the system of solar

And the aroma of doja, the atmospherin' we hearin'

Since I'm the driver I'm ridin' with rear-end super suspension

The misson can't be completed 'til you get that vibe

Now you're mobbin' to the beat on the passenger side



[Hook]

Lean back, roll up, this is how it go

Windows down, music up, this is how we blow

Lean back, roll up, this is how it go

Windows down, music up, this is how we blow



[Verse 2]

We in the tre, so I'mma dip it slow

Next stop is the liquor store

Last sip, pour it back

So good, I had to get some more of that

Yeah. And now we on tizilt

Interior, mizilk - exterior, sizilk

Okay, okay, alright - say it like all day

In the tre with the dawgs, that's the player life

How you feel now?

I know - you probably want the wheel now

But I can't and I ain't, so just roll up some more of that dank

And pour some more of that drank

And hand me that CD so I can let the shit knock

Live in the drop

You can hear it when we comin', we speedin' up the block

While we're beatin' up the block, it's 'bout to go down

Slip-sliding, rip-riding with my broham, haha

Baby just take them panties, let me get inside that pussy slow

Hard times and good times... when they're mixed together
It can only make you stronger... even live a little longer
I see the Gs on the corner, holding steel, think they're real

But oh, it's only a short life...

Pennies on their eyes 'cause they won't see tomorrow



[Hook]

Sometimes, I wanna run away, but I'm holding on to what I feel

In this life, we don't crush no deals, back in the day

Back in the day when I used to be a mindless kid

Now I'm on that holy bid, no regrets for the things I did

It's the only way, only way, only way...

To live with no regrets...

You know you'd better live with no regrets



[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

You can roll up your problems, smoke 'em like a champion

You can pray for a miracle, and still nothing can happen

I ain't never been sober, and I'm a predictor of the future

But oh, it's only a short life...

Pennies on their eyes 'cause they won't see tomorrow

(You know) Or bring me 21-5, get a whole thing

On triple-beams they weigh up

You owe me, homie? Best pay up

Don't make me raise this AK up

You and your homie get sprayed up

My lifestyle wild - he ain't got a clue

Don't let this smile fool you, bruh, this what you'd better do:

Give me my R-E-S-P-E-C-T

'Fore I leave you D-O-A, you won't need no D-O-C

And ain't no other words to say

You make it hard for me to stay

I don't know what to do

'Cause you have got me confused

We talking on the phone

We fussing fight you 'bout that lightening

I just wanna love you right, love you right



Faden away

And I can't go another day

You make it hard to stay away

Girl you've got me faden away

Girl you've got me faden away

And ain't no other words to say

You make it hard for me to stay

Girl you've got me faden away

Faden Away



Make time, make love, that's what we make

Looking nowadays, looking like it's gonna fade

See me, will you see here G soul

If he lose baby he gonna gain another dough

What a brother know, keep it on the low

That's what my grandma said it suppose to go

Feel the same, we toast and post it

And if it all work soft then we casper the ghost

Me and damn phone we capture the phone

Collusion, illusion, set it all foe

Plan with me, for your best, let it all go

The beach and the wind you blow



[Repeat x2]

Faden away

And I can't go another day

You make it hard to stay away

Girl you've got me faden away

And ain't no other words to say

You make it hard for me to stay

It's so hard to stay with you girl

It's even harder to play with you girl

Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now

But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin

Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton

To serve me, not with a cherry on top

Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes

I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'

And I'll be

[Verse - Pharrell Williams]

Uh! I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams

See these ice cubes, see these Ice Creams?

Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat

That's whiter than what's spilling down your throat

The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs

The interior like suicide wrist red

I can excercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed

Cheat on your man ma, that's how you get ahizzead

Killer wit the beat, I know killers in the street

Wit the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat

So don't try to run up on my ear talking all that raspy shit

Trying to ask me shit

When my niggaz fill ya vest they ain't gon pass me shit

You should think about it, take a second

Matter fact, you should take four B

And think before you fuck wit lil skateboard P



[Chorus]



[Verse - Snoop Dogg]

I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that

Da Big Bo$$ Dogg, yeah I had to do that

I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside

But only on the left side, yeah that's the Crip side

Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play

I cut so much you thought I was a DJ

{*scratches*} ""two!"" - ""one!"" - ""yep, three!""

S-N double O-P, D-O double G

I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it

See I specialize in making all the girls get naked

So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside

We got a world premiere right here, now get live!

So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little

I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles

Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle

G's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo



[Chorus]



[Verse - Snoop Dogg]

I'm a Bad Boy, wit a lotta ho's

Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes

I hang out tough, I'm a real Bo$$

Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp

On the TV screen and in the magazines

If you play me close, you're on a red beam

Oh you got a gun so you wanna pop back?

AK47 now nigga, stop that!

C mid shoes, now I'm on the move

You're family's crying, now you on the news

They can't find you, and now they miss you

Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you

Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you

Then dance to this motherfucking music we crip to

Subscribe nigga, get yo issue

Money on my mind, good times and get caked up, uh,
Sunshine coming through my blinds
I'm living but, really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must,
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for



Women, weed and weather

(They come for) women, weed and weather

For the women, weed and weather

(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather



These n*ggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that

Still everybody gotta build for that; me? I make mills off that

How the f*ck can't y'all see I ride, when I drive,

Down the block and you look outside,

H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise

It's a beautiful day I guess for a b*tch to roll with Andre I guess

Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed



You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss

New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York

Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping

But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living



Women, weed and weather

My n*gga said he wanna fly out to get him - some

3 W's only for a three day run

B*tch, take them motherf*cking panties off, you ain't no - nun, sh*t

I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes

Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control

Let it breathe, I control

California living 'til I am old

You want to be one, to peak on the chart

So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts

She in the coupe, she in the Neon

Cause she on the BS before we can start

F*ck with a n*gga, ride with a n*gga

Let 'em know the priority order me Hennessy

And for my n*ggas OG Killa

Call it Jason Voorhees, boy he on his job

Boy he sure be having the marks

On they mark, pretty b*tches and tire marks

Let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts

Let 'em reveal how much it cost

For this life controlling my vice

No way hell no, uh uh

If I'm wrong then I don't wanna be right

You want to be one, to peak on the chart

So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts

Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault

That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off



You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss

Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping

But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

Known for that homegrown where I come from

Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun

I shall proceed, that's me, muthaf*ck your opinion

How many ways am I killing 'em, sh*t, right around a billion

We on it, that mean we living for the moment

That mean she'll f*ck 'til the morning, time and I got time

And I know that I'm in a position of controlling, anything, I buy that ocean

I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody f*cking with this



They want that sh*t, they often fiend, I give it to 'em, but in between

My time, I gotta tie shoestrings, life's a trip when you want these things

I often slip and then I lean toward 3 W's in life

You know blowjob need an application, eating pussy make appetite

And yeah my type, I like 'em brown, just like my drink, the f*ck you think

I don't f*ck wit' no hand me downs, see if you f*ck then it's after me

You know how much I'ma make it work?

You know her dress, slip it in her purse

When you discussed your love for lust

Just make sure you visit here first, Cali

[Verse 1]

They say I walk around like got an ""S"" on my chest

Naw, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest

I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court

But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down like it's sport

Front on me, I'll cut ya, gun-butt ya or bump ya

You getting money? I can't none with ya then fuck ya

I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I.

I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise

I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder

When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?

When the 5th kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder

In December I'll make your block feel like summer

The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine

Every chick I fuck with is a dime

I'm like Patty LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own

Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone

Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya

I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches

Industry hoe fuckers, in the hood they love us

Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new chuckas

Thinking bout 86 damn I was overdue

Walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood

While I'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood

That I came from it raised me real Crip crazy

[?] oops a daisy

Demon or a heathen scheming while I'm dreaming

Screaming to get even seeing is believing

And don't you forget that

Get it to you get back hit that kick back

Three flies one a way

Reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say

Stay in your own lane stay on your own and quick trying to be grown

Day turn to night and play turn to fight

Yeah I guess my granny was right



Reflections of the way life used to be

It's all right



I like them girls from Ladera Heights or the girls on Hills

I take a trip up the World On Wheels and get in a fight

Make it back to my ride

Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side

My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo

Slid me away just to get me away

I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood

I'm banging riding but doing it good

When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering

As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred

With the dealers the killers the [?]

The best from the west and the beast from the east

Yeah I'm acting a fool

I'm getting my degree from gladiator school

I chose this life cause I knows this life

Sell a little crack and my flows is tight

I'm clear on my choice and what's cold is

I can still hear my grandma's voice

She say day turn to night and play turn to fight

Yeah I guess my granny was right



Reflections of the way life used to be

It's all right



If you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk

And these was the rules squeeze on these fools

I came up in a different era homie

Where the G's is the G's and the little wannabe's really want it

Wanna be like cause the C life make you wanna G like

Now who you wanna be like

That fool on the TV screen

Or the homie on the corner getting major cream

In the Cadillac beating like Battle Cat

A nigga with money don't know how to act

Smoke til your eyes get cataracts

All money nonsense yeah none of that

Quarter sack run it back

Hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that

If a trick jump the track do you want your money back

Lil bitch was a bunny rat

Watch for the funny hat

Cause it's gonna come

And my granny said it's no fun

She say day turn to night and play turn to fight

Yeah I guess my granny was right

Went to the station that nigga straight point me out

So I'm a lay away and spray away and spray away

I gotta couple strikes against me one more and I'm on my way

I ain't got time to hang around the hood like I used to do I gotta get my bread

Keep my head it's either go to jail or get this money instead



Separate elevate

Concentrate dominate and innovate

Try to be fly as me

And every other homie tell them lie to me

I need a deal I need some stones

I need some beats Dogg I need a loan

Help me out throw me some cash

If I got you got it and you ain't got to ask

But on the real or is it lately

A lot of homies they tried to implicate me

They say I am changed is it the fame

If I throw it to you then charge it to the game

Money fold overload

I'll break down herbal til I move like a turtle

My money is green and my Porsche is turbo

In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop

Maybe it's the lawyer, her body's the truth



I'm in the game for real, it pay's to chill

I walk in the club and they front the bill

I'm the big dogg, best beware

You're coming with me, if you stop the stare

She'll be on my team in my car on the way to the spot

Yes you are, toasting up, posting up

And when we're done, we west coasting love

Spooned and groomed, dipped and wet

Home of the NBA championship

Purple and Gold, homie let the story be told

It's the city where you shoot your favourite television episode

And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard

But you gotta have a Low-rider car

With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin'

Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon

That's how we represent it though

Birthplace of Chevrolet '64

Rollin' down Fairfax

Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico

Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes

I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues

About 9 o clock stop by the record shop

And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball

Life is a mystery, my life is like history

Stop by my dispensary

Give me some kush and pusha

Put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk

But it's all legal in LA

Everybody taking a hit from the politicians

Athletes and even the teachers

My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher

He say ?Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya?

Yeah, I love showing you now

Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that

One hit of the bong will blow ya face back

LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP



[Hook: John Legend]

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now

Feeling like my life froze

I'm about to hit the ground



[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

I do it cause I feel it

Live it like I'm talkin'

Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and?

I'm so high, yeah the weed, I'm still sparking it

My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling

Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons

Breads in the bag, call it good marketing

Life's a bitch but I don't cartigan?

That's what a word to the third letter

Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar

Run these emcee's I'm tougher than leather

Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever

Fuck with the Dogg I'm biting whomever

Cause I don came from a long path

Only God knows how long the Dogg has

Cause like time we all pass

So if you ever taste success, just pray it's from a tall glass



[Hook: John Legend]

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now

Feeling like my life froze

I'm about to hit the ground



[Verse 3: Kanye West]

I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal

Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal

This game you could never win

Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again

Get away from me misery

Get away from me lonliness

Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness

Get away from me wack tracks

I can only make only hits

I'm an only child lost in the World

Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring

It's Feeling like hell rings

Bringing me back down

Checking my background

It's ironic what's happening

Imagine if I didn't have the ends

I would'nt have so many imaginary friends

I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk

Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk

I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more

I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore

I guess everything I hate about me I see in him

And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again

Till then I'll be pouring out my soul

Just a few things I see with my eyes closed



[Hook: John Legend]

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now

Feeling like my life froze

I'm about to hit the ground"

Eastside Long Beach to be exact
(I was raised in the hood)
Where the grass is greener and the crips are much meaner
(We got ya, back, I was raised in the hood)

I'll never turn my back on the hood

(I was raised in the hood)

Yeah you can take me out the hood

But you can't take the hood up outta me



[Snoop Dogg - Verse 1]

Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the twins

Yeah I'm stealing n-ggas, please what you know bout that

I do it everytime, told em 1800 had em mixing it with lime (oh weee)

My life is like a movie, I was thuggin in the beach when I lit my first doobie

In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie

Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi

Bitch, choose me, cause I'm going to the top

Rap or the rock, them hoes say I'm on bitch

Whenever will it stop

I was poppin'like it's on, slamming Chevy's up the block

East up, what it do though

Now I ride 2-door, the Porsche looking mean

Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a n-ggas still elope

Only cause I was raised in the hood



[Hook]

I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)

I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)

We got ya back

I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)

I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)

We got ya back



[Snoop Dogg - Verse 2]

Raised by the monsters the criminals

The G's, it was ? the n-ggas on the east

What you know bout that?

Snoopy in his prime, I'm a boss

I catch a n-gga slippin' like moss

Ride with the realest , I've been on it since a young'n

It's 200 bitches in the function

Looking cool, you know it bitchy I'm rollin'

And I aint worried bout them n-ggas we patrolling the hood and the city

Rollin on that dilly

2 milly, 2 Bugatti's, call em Rozay and Diddy

Heart of the set, Homie I'm a vet

Lil nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around,

I'm a rep, East up, what it do though

Hoes spillin' Nuvo, Doggy on his tip

I threw up the two O

Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a n-ggas still elope

Only cause I was raised in the hood



[Hook]



[Snoop Dogg - Verse 3]

Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block

It was plenty of them n-ggas on the spot

What you know bout that?

Turned up fully

The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig

Burnt out and any party we at, you know it's turned out

The people talking the rumours

Now what you heard about?

How I spend 100 thou gettin' purped out

I'm strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up

They know I'm famous like I won't get in the streets cuz

Like I don't come from the W, I'm a beast bru

What it do though, dickies for the dulo

Homie, you know skinny n-ggas sumo

Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a n-ggas still elope

Only cause I was raised in the hood

But never did they make the look so good
From candy cars to bright yellow bras
The gangster white walls and the wood
You see, there comes a time in a man's life
Where you gotta choose the goods of the game

Oh, but it so hard to turn your back on a place

Where everybody knows your name



It's a cold game, I ain't been one to

Jump in and out of the range

Maybe an old school synagogue

Spinnin' the vision from which I faint

You got to do it, you can, gotta keep rhymin'

East Side High enjoyin' life, hair blowin' in the wind

The state that I'm in is gangster bliss

This is what you're callin' a sis

Passin' them off quick, memories missed

I made a lot of friends, a whole lot of money

Been down a couple times, but it never stopped my rhymin'

In fact, I got better, clutchin' on Beretta's

Blowin' a sticky, turn it to whether

A war shows in dough free lobos, this is how a player roll

And I never be questioned by some new young chump

Poppin' their toss, Snoopy D.O. made the way for you to walk

Owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done

Your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?

Hold closer my hands from my throne

And I never be crucified within my own zone

Here is a very good reason to show love

But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug

From almost goin' down for murder in '93

To keys all over the city bowlin' in Snoops league

I changed, I got smarter, I got a daughter

Two sons, beautiful wife for starters

I did it all, Jack, poppin' this peas

Eatin' international cuisine overseas, yeah

Don't judge me, you only knew Snoopy

You never tried to know Calvin, you tried to groove me up

Like some loco, I earned my respect

Did so much shit for the Coast, I should get a check

But all in all, I did it big

Cool as a blind with a C

Leveled my life as I push away the groupies

Snoopin' in a coopin', you can call me Uncle Snoopy



(Don't worry about)

Don't worry about your circumstances

Take your chances, still from the L, B, C

For you are the C

Holla at ya uncle Snoopy

Holla at ya uncle Snoopy



I paid my dues

And now it's time to make a change

Gotta make that move

There's a time and place for everythin'

I paid my dues

And now it's time to make a change

Gotta make that move

There's a time and place for everythin'

I paid my dues

And now it's time to make a change

Gotta make that move

So back to the glock with the infra-blue clip

You on some T-Pain shit

Chop the pop and 20 crip

Watch the flames hit his whip

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Snoopy, is what they say as if they knew me
Groupies on my head like a kooflee, my nigga kid cudi,
That's my little buddy,

Call some hoe's up and get some cudi cudi,

What yo life like, mine is kinda tight,

A long way from hustlin, a china white,

My people love, the fans love me I'm all go,

If you ain't showin love then what did you call for,

I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price,

So alike and in need of my wife, smoke till I'm gone,

Dog on the throne I'm world-wide known and a boss in the zone,

I get it how I get it cause I can, I earn the spot,

You see the plans, I'm just fuckin with my fans,

I turned out to be a better man, important for life,

You understand while I'm puffin on this Grande



[Chorus:]

Everything I'm havin, no there ain't necessity,

Though I'm shining, keep on grinding what you see ain't all of me,

Though I keep them hoe's, don't love them hoe's,

The code in which y'all roll, it's so simple what I need,

I keep my Fam and I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah,

I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah,

I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah,

I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah



[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]

I got my fam dog, look at my niggas,

Got little money dogg but I ain't tripping,

Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated,

Steady wanting freaky hoes, then I want a lady,

Holdin' the fam down and the clothes on me,

The people who were there, stupid sucka left me lonely,

Phony, when you see me nigga, don't approach me,

Made it to the top baby, that's on me,

Cops trying to claim that they made me,

I want you to feel another real for gaizing,

I keep it one hundred, never frontin, don't need me,

I'm in the zone, no place for pussy my nigga,

CoГ±o tu hedes na DoГ±o, low pro, how a nigga like from costo,

The one fans loved, who was always a ultra joe-blow,

And I rep the double O, smoking, eating cherrios



[Chorus:]

Everything I'm havin, no there ain't necessity,

Though I'm shining, keep on grinding what you see ain't all of me,

Though I keep them hoe's, don't love them hoe's,

The code in which y'all roll, it's so simple what I need,

I keep my Fam and I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah,

I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah,

I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah,

I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah



[Verse 3:]

Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king,

And I'm still on the scene you gotta love it, all out in public,

The people want to touch it, I need a blunt with the stuffin',

Nigga, it's nuthin for me to chill out and post up at the house,

With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies,

Hollywood nice now,

Everyone want me and on the blogs they talk shit like they know me,

Fool, I'll take you niggas to school, ""How to get rich and stay cool"",

Snoopy D O Dub show you homie, even with the critics and feds on me,

I was tappin all the Choanies,

Dog, but my folks call me snoopy, boss dogg nigga sue me,

Pony tail swinging as I lay in the jacuzzi,

Love of my life while I'm puffing on the good weed



[Chorus:]

Everything I'm havin, no there ain't necessity,

Though I'm shining, keep on grinding what you see ain't all of me,

Though I keep them hoe's, don't love them hoe's,

The code in which y'all roll, it's so simple what I need,

I keep my Fam and I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah,

I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah,

I can't forget that tree,

Nah nah nah nah nah nah,

I can't forget that tree,

[Snoop Dogg]

Hmm, and I ain't never felt like this

I ain't never met a girl with the right mix

Green eyes, light-skinned with some nice tits

It took a minute just to write this

I'm the Boss Dogg baby! I'ma die rich

So let the money talk for me, fuck the nonsense

Hold me down, be my ride or die bitch

We fuck then we fight, we fight then we fuck

I'ma beat it up tonight like Kimbo Slice

Come live the proper life, no I ain't the shoppin type

I might take you out to eat, we can grab a bite

Now let me grab my bike and roll yo' ass through Crescent Heights

Up in Hollywood, step into the limelight

and hit this bubble kush, let me get your mind right

This is ""Wonderland,"" let your mind take flight

We gotta hurry up, I'm only here for one night



[Chorus]



[Snoop Dogg]

This next girl Bird, she from the suburbs

and live by herself, like cars and nice furs

and loves hip-hop - The Neptunes and Murs

But I'm her favorite rapper, my biggest fan is her

I like her skin tone, and how her figure curves

We smoke mad kush and drink until our vision blur

And then I pat her down, like she gettin searched

I fuck her with my chain on, she pulls on my shirt

like nigga don't stop, until the pussy squirt

I hit it twice and bone out, she went back to work

This happens all the time, I gotta go rehearse

for my next show, I tour on May 1st

Get yo' mind right, and this may work

You know love is pain, and havin faith hurts

You rollin with the best, so grab your heels and purse

and welcome to ""Wonderland"" the best place on Earth

Uhh, you gon' love me!



(""And ohh you're gonna love me"")

(""You're gonna wanna hug me, and"") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me

[? ]
Reap while I stay
Getting Richard (richer) like Pryor
Need to put the gun away
Cus I got pryors

It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders

Bullet tip on fire

Flyin down sunset

Motivated to win

Like I ain't won yet

Take shit over

Hell naw I ain't done yet

I LBC ya'll bringin?

Tonight it's going down like free fall

Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see saw

Trippin off hate no hee haw

All blacks locs on the loc

Actin like I don't see ya'll

Doing that shit to da mean dogg

When I bring it to you

You be like what you mean dogg?

Then we go back and forth like it's ping pong

Knowin I should just ring ya bell ding dong

But that's one thing about this shit partner

Every move is so watched by these rich boxes

So why should I lose all my rich sponsors

I'm gone then you suddenly hip hoppin

Shit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind

Pop a? like an m n m

So strong yet a nigga thin

Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talking Eminem

So fuck you him and him

I was gangbangin before a nigga mtv

No facade I went from the yard to a 3 car garage

To instant manaj just vintage, relentless

I mean this I promise

No Suge, No Dre, Ida did this regardless

And that's what I'm supposed to think

Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink

Motherfucka, this crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill

Pushin 40s still a big deal

Ponytail still swanging, hair still braided

Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded

Nigga! So buzz on that shit

Backflip back to plack shit

Blue red white to black shit

But for the green I send a whole motherfuckin team to clack shit

React to mack shit

Problem, terrorist

Fuck this rap shit"

You want to catch me out of pocket but I can't get caught

I'm a show you what a bitch thought, a bitch taught

A nigga got played out and layed out in chalk

It's a cold game

It's like a rap riddle

Nine times out of ten a bitch was in the middle

Most neighborhoods started off cool

In the eighties it was Long Beach fool

With no seperation

Here's a toast to the real shit, the foundation

You know my game is amazing

I keep blazing

Eastside niggas is the craziest and the shadiest

Yeah dawg, tell 'em again

What you talking 'bout loc?

Hoping that her smiling exes fall (ego hustling loopholes)

I'd always thought that you would've never have stabbed me everywhere

More rumours, more lies

More money, more time

I don't really give a fuck cause you all gon' shine

So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine

I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes

So jealous, so envious

What a drag

Real talk loc, you ain't acting like a man

Your message is how blessed you is

I guess you is

Look at the mess you in

And Snoopy is your homie

Nah nah girl he out of here

You a fool Jack

Though I don't condone faking for a bitch

Don't call it pimping when you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch

Go ahead and talk money

Talk, look at the chicks it brought

But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault

Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for

Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for

I do this balling cause I can not cause it's cool

I pop cause I'm the man

Now watch me and Kells

I got pimping in my veins

Pimping in my blood

Pimping in my swag

Pimping in my cup

Walking like a pimp when I walking through the club

Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love

Pimp by day, pimp by night

Pimp haters make me keep my pimp game tight

See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug

Like shots of patron make a nigga want fuck

But I ain't on that shit so I'm a throw my hands up

And keep it sexy pimping cause that's how I does

Uncle Snoop say Kells go hard or go home

Yo hating motherfuckers, I'm still here

To all my honeys in the club getting money with the thugs

Keep it pimping baby

So what, that's probably why we Cali-fornicate

And shake to a whole nother elevation

Catch me in the hood or your favorite television station

Creatin', a whole nother lane for the generation

Dippin', Rippin', shakin' and bakin'

I'm playful but I don't play

Spinnin' the globe like the strobe

Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night

If I plan to go right, a cold night

in hell before I fail, I'm alright

Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'

Breath of fresh air, classic debonair

Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand

Finger roll cold, Dogg the Ice Man

Brazil to Iceland

I shine like a million lights man

The talk of the town, believe it or doubt it

I don't need to shout it, you better read about it



[Chorus]

Snoop Dogg is out

You wanna be there partyin'

All night long

Until the break of dawn

Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh

Now pose like a superstar, walk like a model

I love it when you pop that bottle

I love it 'cause you're not so automatic

I love it when you put it where Dogg can grab it

I got my hands where you'll let me

I love it when you dance, so sexy

I love it when you in that night mood

Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you

I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to

Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue

I let it do what it might do

Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery

I'm blessed with history

No less than best, catch the rest

Live in the flesh, smooth with the style I choose

Not off the stress, I'm hot off the press



[Chorus]

Snoop Dogg is out

You wanna be there partyin'

[Intro:]
Fifteen years in da game man, and I'm still relevant, it's a blessing
It's a fine line how to keep it cool and keep it g
All keeping a g is keeping it cool, and all keeping it cool is keeping it g



[Verse 1:]

1992, d cover hit da world and fell in love with snoop

Doggystyle came out, it's like I dropped the bomb

One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time

I was young, gettin' money, livin' wild and free

Got owned and I Brought The whole pound with me

Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way to G

Niggaz know it was eastside LBC

Gangsta shit, That's what a Mothaf**kin' Gangsta Get

The one up above Didn't Like My Pace

I was movin' too fast Then I Caught That Case

Hm, I fought dat case, wondered where da west would be if I'd have lost That case

I slow ma down, swimin' with da sharks and I almost drowned



[Chorus:]

I done made some mistakes long da way, to become da G I am today

Who'd ever thought I'd make it this far, out the hood to be a big star

And I ain't going nowhere, only I ain't ever comin' down

I'm too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat



[Verse 2:]

I'm finally out, and da critics say they love me cause I went to the south

Said I wasn't gone shine, had me left for dead, switch sides, now my old boss want me dead

Dropped the first of the three, and you said it was weak, No Limit Top Dogg the return of da biz

And from dat point on, I know what to do

Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do

Last Meal was the one who took me off the leash, dats da last time a nigga gonna eat off of me

Stack Black after black game, mil your soul

I'm da boss of this bitch and I ain't never went gold, nigga



[Chorus:]

I done made some mistakes long da way, to become da G I am today

Who'd ever thought I'd make it this far, out the hood to be a big star

And I ain't going nowhere, only I ain't ever comin' down

I'm too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat



[Verse 3:]

Boss of da city, boss of da coast, some otha niggaz try but none of them come close

They stuck like a silly, but nothing like a loke

Da big bow wow, I kill it with one stroke

Dats what it's about, they tryin' a tell a nigga what to come out his mouth

Mothaf**ka I'm a G, but first I'm a man, freedom of speech, bitch is a word you can't ban

So they blamin' me, saying this my talk, just some women is hoes like it's my fault

Hm, damn they lost, they just don't know dat a bitch is a bitch and a hoe is a hoe

Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk

I'mma be smokin Down, Livin Like A Boss

Let them Heaters Cock and let them leaders talk

I'mma be smoking Down Livin Like A Boss NIGGA



[Chorus:]

I done made some mistakes long da way, to become da G I am today

Who'd ever thought I'd make it this far, out the hood to be a big star

And I ain't going nowhere, only I ain't ever comin' down

I'm too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat



[Outro:]

Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat

Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat

Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat

Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat

Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat

Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat

Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat

Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat

Too high, to ever have to worry 'bout dat

To ever have to worry 'bout dat

No, no, to ever have to worry 'bout dat

No, no, no, to ever have to worry 'bout dat

I'm tryin' to meet a few new ones

What's up with you girl, maybe we can do somethin'

Do you drink, do you smoke?

Hang with me, the first thing you do is get stuck

Take you somewhere, later on you'll get fucked, beotch!

Headed to the club in my brand new scaper

Gators on my feet, money in my pocket

I gotta do a show so you know I'm bout to rock it

See my homie $hort, layin' low-key

I strolled over to him, and passed him the bleezy

Dogg y Dog, anything goes

Snappin' my fingers, crackin' at some hoes

What do ya know, I'm in The A gettin' play all day

A lot of y'all wanna ball and try to walk this way

Y'all want that shine-shine but that's all mine

I'm bonafied, qualified to have a hot damn time

Now listen, get the picture, and take a picture of me quick

See 'cause tomorrow I got a new city that I'm gon' hit

A double whammy, right before I do the Grammy's

So, hopefully this record will help you

Get to the conclusion, ya dig?



I love this girl but I don't know about her

.As a matter of fact, I could go without her

But she got my daughter, I don't know why I bother

to try to make it work when she make it so harder

Wake up and break up and do the same thing tomorrow

I get tired of fightin', I feel no sorrow

for you, to keep it movin' in that Monte Carlo

That's what I get for fuckin' with a video model

You act too wild, I won't walk you down the aisle

What you thought? Yeah, we could chill, we could talk

When I look you in your eyes I no longer see sparks

I got to many on my side - I got to many in my face
Come ride with me
Take you where the gangstas play
Often heard but seldom seen

Thats the way that its supposed to be

When you do see me

Mobbin wit a gangsta lean

Got a piece by my side

You can ride baby close your eyes girl



{Chorus: Nate Dogg, Butch Cassidy, & Kokane}

I'm so cool

Cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool

It's me I'm back again

It's never gonna end

I know y'all heard it all before

I just gotta give ya more

Catch me rollin in the night

If I turn off my lights

The eastsidaz in the game

You hear my voice and know my name

You should bang this down on your block

All through your hood

Burnin trees...burnin trees

Ladies let the music run right through you

Just like I'll do - Butch Cassidy

I'm so cool I that I sweat ice cubes when I'm heated up

Take this move, this groove and still G it up

Stroll so slow you swore my leg was broke

Im Tracy Dee but think of me as mr. freeze

Gangsta leanin on the scene on them twisted deez

Big ballin mad doggin like a gangsta ride

As I exit I step with my stacey shine

I'm so cool but motherfcukers know I'm a fool

Ten times outta ten catch me toaten the tool

Laid back or stay strapped for pay back

To think that I'm slippin then crippin from way back

Now let me break it down a notch

Smooth like I do when I pound the cock

We cold motherfuckas holdin down the block

Everybody knowin that tha dogg pound is hot

Throwin dogg pound up

Snappin my fingaz stompin my feet

It's what you get from a gangsta with these hard ass beats

I'm cool as fuck and don't say to much

As the gangstas go dead diggle my niggle

Still got patience still makin niggaz

Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy

[Snoop Dogg]

Huh, it's like that that there

They love it when I let down my hair

from Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson

even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel

So I let 'em all come to my back table

Roll up and lick the paper if they able

Bottles of everything, models and everything

Everything goes and yes I mean everything

Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'

But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'

So, I invite her over to my party

Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie

No autographs, I ain't signin' now

Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down

My life is like one big highlight

Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life



[Chorus]

Those Hollywood nights

They drive me crazy

Those Hollywood nights

They drive me crazy



[Snoop Dogg]

Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion

With some whites, some asians and persians

They flirtin', and I'm certain they suckin'

One night with the Dogg and it's curtains

She say she wanna be an actress

So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled ACTION!

Take one, take two, now cut

Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck

Huh, yeah, here we go again

I gotta go behind the club just to get in

They say I'm just too much commotion

All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open

I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub

Smokin' with one of the Marley's, ""One Love""

I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass

Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, c'mon



[Chorus]

Those Hollywood nights

They drive me crazy

Those Hollywood nights

They drive me crazy



[Snoop Dogg]

Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room

I'm on Sunset (where you at?) at The House of Blues

I just stepped in for a quick cameo

Me and Leonardo DiCaprio

He keep a bad hoe, I keep a bad hoe

He slide me new hoes everywhere we go

Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight

Yes, these Hollywood nights

Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out

You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out

Cameras flashin', police passin'

Every little model wanna give me some action

So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it

Get some m_nage, durin' every visit

I wouldn't leave it, even if they paid me

The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy



[Chorus]

Those Hollywood nights

They drive me crazy

Those Hollywood nights

They drive me crazy"

I know I'm always on the road, I'm always gone
And you say I'll never make records for you no more
Well this record is from me to you baby
Yeah, real talk

Been around tha world

I've been into many places seen some unfamiliar faces

But baby none of them compares to you

Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone



I seen everything twice

Been around tha world, I've seen every scene twice

Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice

I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice



I do it big, fuck the rumors

Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas

Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami

I did all that, I was voted ...



I'm sorta like Sammy

Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy

Sipping Chardinae, making deals on my hands free

Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me

'Cause I own rap and I'm coming for your day job



Until then I'm chilling at the day spa

Relax my mind and just chill

'Cause without you none of this is real

Baby you know I



Been around tha world

I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces

But baby none of them compares to you

Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone



Yeah, but now I'm back across the water

I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter

Blowing sticky by the zips and they can tell

By my rag hanging, fuck this is Crip, but I'm chilling



It feels so good to get away

Especially when your name is D O double Gizzee

Coast to coast jetting, man I been doing that

What's up, just start balling ... I been around the track



Hop in Peas with the bosses

300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office

Docking down in Monaco, churching with my folks

Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat



My life is like a movie

But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me

Then I relax and chill

'Cause without you none of this is real

Baby you know I



Been around tha world

I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces

But baby none of them compares to you

Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone



Been around tha world

I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces

But baby none of them compares to you

Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone



Just for you baby

Yeah, I'm on my way home right now

I'm on my way right now

I'm leaving the studio right now



Yeah, soon as I get home tomorrow I'ma go unplug it

Matter of fact I ain't even gonna bring it in the house

See you in a minute"

Hold my lord [? ]

I'm sittin at the board with my head down

I can't write my next line I need to lay it down (hmm)

I'm stuck like a dumptruck

Lookin stupid, cupid, down on my luck

I touch, a four leaf clover

Hopin for somethin good, like I should

If not, I guess it's over

Baby be real with it

Do you love me?

Do you miss me?

Shit I can't deal with it



[Chorus x2]

I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammis
But these streets won't say a goodbye



I can't say goodbye

To the blocks

Goodbye

To the hood

Goodbye

To the streets (to my problems)

I can't say goodbye

To the hood

Goodbye

To the blocks

Goodbye

To the streets

I can't say goodbye goodbye

To the blocks

Goodbye

To the streets

Goodbye

To the hood

I can't say goodbye

To the hood

Goodbye

To the blocks

Goodbye

To the homies



[VERSE: SNOOP DOGG]

I quess it's tru, you can't take the hood out a homeboy

Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy

Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy

They in the street tell me ""just leave it alone boy,

Let them do them take care of your own boy""

But I said back brake a bound, before I was drome boy

You had dreams of being a dope boy

Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po

Banging for the turth, late night huntin'

Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,

Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first

Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church

Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st

I know since I left that it's gotten much worse

But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse



[CHORUS: CHARLIE WILSON]

I'm a man I gotta take care of my family

Fighting these precious in my life

I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammis

But these streets won't say a goodbye



[VERSE: SNOOP DOGG]

To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made

Me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would moul me

Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,

But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,

And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted

To the life, you just don't OD, I owe the streets before they owe me

Took me in when my moma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and cops

Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man

In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams [? ]

The reason I'm so nice with my hands [? ] shit, you think I forgot, man



[CHORUS: CHARLIE WILSON]

I'm a man I gotta take care of my family

Fighting these precious in my life

I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammis

But these streets won't say a goodbye



[VERSE: SNOOP DOGG]

Thank good every day that the boy could spit

And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit

I know I got plenty more wars to get

I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids

But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit

They made me how I am, the music in the man

Told me that I can for the world gave a damn

If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan

Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand

Probably be doin' a dub and the? with my man

The say leaders streets but they don't really understand

All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans

Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins

All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids

If it all come down and my carrer was to end, I'm sure my name

Would live... in the streets



[CHORUS: CHARLIE WILSON]

I'm a man I gotta take care of my family

Fighting these precious in my life

I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammys

But these streets won't say a goodbye



I just can't say goodbye



I can't say goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye

I can't say goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye

I can't say goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye

I can't say goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye



You can take the man out the streets,

But you can't take the streets out the man

Nobody, does it better 
Nobody, does it better
Nobody, does it better
[Chorus]

They can come closer than close, yeah

Original they never will be

We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah

We just tryin' make you see

Nobody does it better



I'm sittin' here trippin'

My mind is blocked

Nate Dogg just spit it so it's time to cock

No one can do it better like this 2 man crew

They say we're one hit quitters

So what cha'll gonna do?



Always into somethin', that's my name

Only out for money, hey 'cause that's the game

People always ask me why I'm out for scratch

He who has the most is he who won the match



Strike one

Me and Nate Dogg is a match

Stike two

Leave 'em standing still in their tracks

Strike three

You can call us two one three

It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G



My exhibition started back in '93

No one, nobody listenin' but Warren and me

To all the nonbelievers, now I bet you see

Nobody does it better than me



[Chorus]



They call me DJ and the spark plug

Keepin' it licked

There is no accident for these platinum hits

So when we make it to show love,

Bangin' in your club

Hangin' with your thugs

Givin' up G love



Do you remember back on the east side?

When all of us niggas used to love to ride

We didn't care what we did

Time was nothing to us, we were just kids

Times are different now, but you still get stuck

I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck

So if you think you really wanna step to me

Keep this is mind: nobody does it better than me



[Chorus]



Wow, make you say go now

Hot rap singles on the charts now

Got a baby

So I'm breakin' hearts now

On your mark, get set, it starts now



All you pimp playin' hustlers, now ya know

You can't keep me out once you crack the door

Either join a team or it's best you flee

Nobody does it better than me



[Chorus]



[Repeat: x2]

Nobody, does it better"

Relatives gotta live, what it do blood?

On the grind, one time, yea that's the bizz

Better get some heat when you're creepin through the beach

To each his own, the beach is long

We wanna bang with Snoop, we wanna bang with Daz

Opposite of G ridin, fly took a wage

Back to the east side, east side's where we goin

Whenever I'm makin a record, I'm gettin into my character

And I'm tryin to portray somethin that I'm feelin so that way the whole

world can believe in it

Do anybody know my name!?

(Snoop Dogg!) What's my name!?

(Snoop Dogg!) Hold on, I want y'all to say my name like dis..

(Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snooooop)

There are seven wonders in the world, you're about to witness the eighth

[Jay-Z sample] Nigga ask about me, nigga ask about me!)

You don't believe me? Motherfucker say what!?

Aiyyo Cat, roll out the blue carpet cuzz

Lemme C-walk on these niggaz



Blue hat, blue socks, blue shoes, too cool

Blue car, blue house, blue pit, blue pool

Blue grass, blue Coupe, blue b-ball hoop

What kind of phone you on Loc? I'm on the blue too

Talkin to my nephew, my nigga Boo, half who?

He make pimpin on a bitch look so cool

Old school, old fools, steel on a nigga first

Run up with that punk shit and I fill up a nigga's shirt

Do it to it hurt 'cause it hurt so bad (so bad!)

Snoopy D O dub they can't touch yo' swag (yo' swag!)

Oh mark ass nigga better tuck yo' flag

'Cause when my music out loco, I come to smash yo' ass

Fuck him, fuck her, and fuck all y'all too

(He wants everything to be right) 'Cause I'm... (Snoop Dogg!)

and every time that you see me cuzz, I'm oh so blue!

You know It's easy to talk about, doing something 
But when it comes down to the actual part most folks take a little light vacation. 
I was just thinking to myself man, you know this Blue carpet treatment record is deep to me. 

And I need to let my peoples know how deep it is to me. On some real 

talk like... 



It's like, lookin and poppin and seeing whoopers and movies despited guided 

that tried to be hard on the loc. Nobody's guided so I desided sling by the dough. 

Open my mind tried to slip inside my grandfathers folks. Drifting off to another 

stage of life, nigga paid your prize and big homies made you fight. 

Niggas aint wanna see a nigga be-bop no? Toe for toe I beat them niggas down on the floor. 



[Chorus:]

Incredible forgedable, better blast past and move their mind 

many men where eradicated by music mines 

Open your eyes and take your time to visualize 

And once you deside to move your mind then do time 

It's so erotic even exotic, it's getting naughty 

Freeze and groove your rady rady girl move your body 

It's melodic I'm being honest and modest 

You did fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it. 



Fuck that nigga I'm a do it right, thangs aint movin right, I dont think that you would like 

For me to be mad sayin niggas cant stab me, sittin at home watchin mothafuckas at the grammy's 

Wishin I was there, nah nigga I dont wish no mo, I'm the big cat fish in the bowl 

Basically you hear these rappers out here usin my flow 

they need snoop on their song to make their shit official though 

In this missimissible releasing niggas modern day king of mine 

takin my time, canalising my rhyme, writin my rhyme 

tryin to get intelectual, directing the wheather, makin my negative records more intelectual 

Tryin to change the direction of flowin and sayin born sayin you know I get liver when I get flowin 

aint been nobody to change game since king king same thing same lane, then biggy-biggy-bang 

word to rob base just make the music dope, thangs dont change man it's so remarcable 

and they dont know how to do it, cause they dont flow that way, go that way, roll that J 

roll my tape and take me back the day you were fooling 



[Chorus:]

Incredible forgedable, better blast past and move their mind 

many men where eradicated by music mines 

Open your eyes and take your time to visualize 

And once you deside to move your mind then do time 

It's so erotic even exotic, it's getting naughty 

Freeze and groove your rady rady girl move your body 

It's melodic I'm being honest and modest 

You did fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it."

fools don't respect nothing but the gang bang

what's seen is what's sawn dogg it's the law

I have you niggas running like a marathon

Lil g's tryinna creep on the east wit it

Talking bout they gon get my chain and they gon leave wit it

But they don't know once they get close its tic tac toe

Three motherfuckers layed on the floor

Yee this happened yesterday

On the west they spray I heard an essai say

[hook:]

Vato you won't believe what I saw

I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (nd what dey do)

He said I don't give a fuck I'm snoop doggy dog (Plow)

They keep talking and they went too far

So snoopy he went straight to thee trunk of his car (nd whut he did)

He got his gun and they start runnin' hard

He started firing and then he just charged

Now that's three mothafuckas dead and I ain't seein' shit

But these niggas are scream for plea

But for a G like me it's just a case really you could see

I crack the mac back and cop off rollin

And smack ya neck back you drop off fallin

I haven't seen my momma in a week

And she ain't even ran a mouth about me

Fuck that I ain't give a fuck about the law

Niggas say they wanna brawl

You would think that they were bra's

Believing all the things that you never saw

In it yall, been a dogg, smoke you like a menathol

You think you know but this can't go

You think you blow on my dough

What the fuck no

See these niggas proceed with slizz

So feel the need to bleed

All you hear my enemies goin'..

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am

If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth (i be damned)

And snoop'll keep one foot on these streets

And leave em covered in sheets

Run wit them niggas wit the heat

You never seen a thug like this

You never seen a dub like me

And I ain't weak for wanting peace

In fact I could be beast of the east motherfucka

I never hesistate to blaze

A nigga really tryinna change his ways

We gotta move my team cuz my peoples

is screaming that we need more

buffalo is illegal

Ba-ba-bang on the song

Make it feel like a drive-by

It's a shame but somebody gotta die

They see it happen state to state

But when I'm mobbin' LA

All I hear that essai say

Knockin' out 

Without protection though

Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay

Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay

But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't

That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life

Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's

And the G's puttin work in overseas

At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed

F**k it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me

Baby this is presidential really

A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living

Show them hoes how you winning

It's the beginning with the pearls you're given

The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon

But everyday like 50 Cent, yes Many Men

They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends

But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs

Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go

You know how the Dogg roll.. don't get it twisted

'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit

A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish

And it's comin from the Beach where them niggaz is a beast

But I just listen, all that shit is in my past

I'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last

From Long Beach to Venice is the premise

Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish



[Chorus: Nate Dogg]

See me man, I'm nothin like you

I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to

I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin

Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin



I'm livin that boss' life (life)

Girls come runnin when they see me comin

I'm livin that boss' life (life)

You can have anything just don't touch my money (my money)



[Snoop Dogg]

This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South

Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz with the platinum mouths

Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out

When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout

But trickin ain't the route (route), that's even if you got it

There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it

Just put the P up in it nigga if she 'bout it

You can have her and her partner, f**kin with it for a dolla

If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller

Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala

And if she follow.. then she gon' swallow

All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow

But I would never bother breakin out (Tha Doggfather)

'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin diamonds on his collar

I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners

Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor (Doctor)

[Snoop Dogg:]

West West y'all, pile it on your plate

A little somethin' somethin' from the Golden State

Nah, we ain't like Kobe and Shaq

It's Magic and Kareem nigga, Showtime is back

True legends, two steppin' on you peasants

What y'all thought, y'all gon' need bout two vests'

Cause we he plug, I plug

Mixed shot with the slug, listen here cuh

when I dig dug - play slick and get stuck

But don't play tough boy, go and get it up

Hey yo Cube, tell me this

Why half of the homies gettin' worked by a bitch?

Then they fall in love and get hurt by a bitch

Nine months later cause got mirked by a bitch

See I'm just a nigga that ya don't wanna

Reverse the game on her, put the bitch on a corner

Welcome to California

I'm scoopin' you up, ya rollin' or what?

I know what ya came for, I'm rollin' it up

Snoop Dogg nigga, y'all hold up

Never thought Ice Cube would show up

But I'm in the studio gettin' fucked up

with a beat from Battlecat, a nigga lucked up

I got my hustle down, look and learn

See how a hot nigga, cook and burn

A nigga earn like David Stern

mixed with Big Worm when he off that sherm

Now - bust a u-turn, come by your hood

For motherfuckers that think I went Hollywood

Pick a Coast, it got to be the West

I live out there, from the W.S. nigga

Fell asleep on the plane, and so did he

Woke up chillin' in the LBC

I grew up in the HNC

But that ain't what I turned out to be

Understand me that I'm still a G

who ain't never spent a day in the penitentiary

Now I'm rappin' with Snoop D-O double-G

And got the whole fuckin' world nigga lovin' me



[Snoop Dogg:]

Yep yep, they love him to death

Cause he walk under water, without gettin' wet

Roll through the neighborhood without gettin' checked

So gone and so blown, are we there yet?

You wonder why I got the S on my chest

cause I'm a motherfuckin' vet from the Wild Wild West

I used to sing ""Bennie and the Jets""

Nigga so boss now I sip Henny on my jets

From the East back to the West

Hah! sicka than your average

Money too long can't stash it

In the closet or the mattress

Paper, stretch like elastic

Checks from advances, the bank can't cash it

So the price for that, never ask it

Just sign my name or pop plastic

Hating ass cops wanna harrass em

Searching for a glock in the pocket of his fashion

Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses

And they left breast (yes!)

Let's get dressed and toast to the occasion

Cops couldn't page em, flow so amazing, hot like cajun

You fucking wit the champ

Pop corks on champ' like I just took the chip

Nigga took the stand when he coulda took the 5th

Yeah eat a dick wit AIDs on the tip, keep my name off ya lips

Not guilty!



[Chorus]



[Verse - Beanie Sigel]

I said I'm sicka than your average

Keep three shooters like the Mavericks

Short to the point like Nash is, fucking wit a savage

Niggaz press they luck, get bucked like ashes

Three piece suits, linen fabrics

Three quarter croc, sharper than a pastor

B Sig bring the light to the masses

Of these rap bastards, who gives street passes

One shooting can lead to three caskets

Jump suits, state boots, at least three stabbings

You softer than a Reebok Classic

Folding under pressure when confronted by them badges

I was taught stay low and keep blasting

Po only know questions that was answered

Keep a number on the high price lawyer

It's five ways now days, everybody saw ya



[Chorus]



[Bridge - repeat 2x]

[SD] Now let's toast to the man, that when he get out

That he gon do them thangs that he rap about

A true playa Pha-real [Pharrell]

[BS] Haters stay out my face

And know that thing still by my waist



[Verse - Beanie Sigel]

Once again I'm sicker then 'em all

Niggaz see C's start shitting in they drawers

When I kick in the door, stop the blood clot crying

Wipe the piss off the floor

The ape is back, my gate is cracked

My jumpsuit and my cuffs is off

Yeah I'm back on them bricks

Raise your cups and raise your glass

And let's toast to the boy B Mack, yeah I'm back in the mix!

Snoop Dogg, this what it is man 
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man 
And i think it's time for me and you to just 
Tone it down a bit 

Come on 



[Dr.Dre Verse #1] 

Imagine it never happened 

Imagine no rappin' 

Imagine niggas trapped 

Imagine it havin' action 

Imagine how these niggas could be actin' 

If you never got this shit crackin 

Imagine life so hard 

You can't imagine it's like livin' in city of god 

You feel me 

Imagine life on the yard 

I'm tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty ass job 

Imagine Biggie with his son 

Imagine Pac gettin' call pop 'bout one 

Imagine a mother struggling 

Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son 

Imagine life where you can't win 

When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen 

When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz 

So if you get back to the streets you go right back in 

Imagine Russell still struggling 

No Def Jam just antoher nigga hustlin' 

And no rocks on them fellaz 

Just rocks on them fellaz 

Just try and keep it bubblin' 

Imagine niggas dressed up 

From the east to the west coast, everybody fucked up 

I can't imagine no less 

But it don't take imagination 

To know niggas been blessed with 

HIP-HOP 



[Chorus] 

Before we go 

Can you imagine? 

Picture years, with your mom 

Can you imagine? 

Hang her picture in the sky 

Can you imagine? 

Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life. 



[Snoop Dogg Verse #2] 

Could you imagine bein' lit up by some hot shells? 

Imagine being tossed around and put in jail 

Imagine life when you can't get from under 

Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo' 

Remember when they asks ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch 

When they kick you in your dick and take your shit 

We actin' like they hate to see you gun hoe 

But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know. 

Imagine niggaz in the LBC felt just like Snoop Dogg & D-R-E, 

And felt just like the niggaz in the 2-1-3. 

Then imagine us was comin' when you fuckin' with me. 

Imagine you was up on top of this shit 

Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick 

I mean imagine we said fuck this shit 

Imagine if my niggaz got together and tow up this bitch, yeah 

You can't imagine growin' up in the jail done 

Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run 

Would you imagine growin' up to sell your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' off somebodies son 

Imagine if these niggaz never saw a colour 

Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggaz kill each other 

All the drunk fool get us pissed on balls 

He fuckin' off my niggaz, they gone murder us all 

Imagine that 



[Chorus] 

Before we go 

Can you imagine? 

Picture years, with your mom 

Can you imagine? 

Hang her picture in the sky 

Can you imagine? 

Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life

[Snoop Dogg:]
Brothers is wack by popular demand
Chasin fame and girls livin they life on cruise control
But tell me; what do it profit a man

to gain a whole world livin trife but then lose his soul?

I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreamin

Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steamin

Even though my star gleamin man my life ain't trouble-free

Homie take it from me, Snoopy D-O-double-G



[Stevie Wonder:]

It's no better people who have left the problems of today

Leavin to conclude that for their life is not the way

But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find

You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind

When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd

Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood

Heyyyyyyeahhhheyyyy



[Snoop Dogg:]

So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed

Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong

Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have

As God blessed the child that can go get his own

And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feelin like this life is a trip

Tryin to keep our hearts pure through the sins

But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich

But to them they can endure to the end and win



[Stevie Wonder:]

When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd

Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood... yeahhhheyyyy

[scatting to a harmonica]

Out here the only free psychiatrist, that's known throughout the world

Is fall in love by walks of all men and women, it's all boys and girls

When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd

Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood



[Snoop Dogg:]

Whether it's soldiers on the cell block or homies on the run

With God, man ain't no obstacles that you can't overcome



[Stevie Wonder:]

When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd

Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood



[Snoop Dogg:]

You're so frustrated, worryin 'bout your bread

And some mornings, you don't even wanna get out the bed



[Stevie Wonder:]

When you lose too much too baaaaaaad

Just go talk to God and prayyyyy



[Snoop Dogg:]

And you's a good women, but you can't understand

why it seems like you ain't never gon' find yourself a good man



[Stevie Wonder:]

When you feel your life's too HARRR-ARRRRRD

Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood



[Snoop Dogg:]

Mothers on welfare or ladies that's strippin

You under so much pressure, feel like your sanity's slippin



[Stevie Wonder:]

When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd!

Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood, hmmm

He'll never never let you down



[S.W.:] You know that, don't you Snoop?

[Dogg:] You know I know it Uncle Steven

[S.W.:] Oh I know that too, we know it

[Dogg:] Yeah we do

[S.W.:] Thanks a lot man

[Dogg:] Nah thank you man I appreciate that, you know I love you

[S.W.:] And I love you for what you sayin

[Dogg:] God bless you



[Snoop Dogg:]

And you can catch me down on my knees, askin the Lord please

Even Jes' pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease

There's disease, poverty, congestion or oppression

I'm askin for your protection and thanking you for your blessing

Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm tryna roll

Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that's the goal

Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't askin too much

Now that's tabernacle, chuuuch!"

Special dedication from the D.P.G.C.
To all the homies locked down
Hope that we could be together soon

On some real talk

We used to do it big out here, my nig

You should see how we doin' it out here now

Check it out...



[Daz]

It's been eighteen years since I seen you on the streets

You're up for parole heard the word this week

My cousin Flip comin' home damn it's been so long

Keep ya eyes on the prize, homie keep ya head strong

Sendin' ya packages, kites keep you straight

Keepin' this commissary fat 'til the take(?)

So we can chop it up, so we can spread the icin'

Enticing OG's fo' surely, you know I like it

This is a D.P.G. dedication

It's for my homies on parole or probation

And you can catch a case homie on vacation

It's for the radio, so ya'll just bang it



[Snoop]

To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettin' out

Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got clout

One love, Eastside, that's how we do right

D.P.G.C. we do or die

Oh yes we fresh to death, nonetheless

When we was out, we was rockin' Guess

But guess what?, now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin'

And every nigga in the click straight rollin'



[Chorus: Nate Dogg]

Hope that, we can be, be together real soon...

I hope that, we can be, be together real soon

Real soon...



[Kurupt]

Just a little bit of game ain't a damn thang

Let the heater rang, bang, Dogg Pound gang swang

Ride wit me, let me show ya how the D.P do

G.C. Dat Nigga Daz, Kurupt, Nate, Snoop

The homies might flash

Kick back, send about five of 'em past

All I wanna do is D.P.G.

And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets

Ridin' by, gettin' high, do that one-two step

Make the whole spot stop, then hit the vogue(?) next

Me and Daz ridin' side by side

Nate and Snoop ridin', one in front, one behind.



[Snoop]

To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettin' out

Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got clout

[Nate Dogg]

Nigga out up on the streets tryin' to come on up

Got caught slippin', and got caught the hell up

Just tryin' to make some money wit my rhymes

Cheddar for my baby, then live right

Got me a room and a couple of rocks

Raised on the streets, yes, the school of hard knocks

Nigga betta pay me, ready or not

Findin' dead bodies all on your block

Nigga gotta get paid, and that's on the real

Broke on the smoke, then you know how I feel

I miss the real gangsta's, and that's on the real

Got locked up while chasin' the scrill...

On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick



When I met you last night baby

Before you opened up your gap

I had respect for ya lady

But now I take it all back

Cause you gave me all your pussy

And ya even licked my balls

Leave your number on the cabinet

And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call

Next time I'm feeling kinda horny

You can come on over, and I'll break you off

And if you can't fuck, that day, baby

Just lay back, and open your mouth

Cause I have never

Met a girl

That I love

In the whole wide world



Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke

I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke

I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me

Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?

I have no love for hoes

That's something I learned in the pound

So how the fuck am I supposed

To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe

I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times

And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it

Pass it to the homie, now you hit it

Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me

And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me

I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention

Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt

Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!



It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none



Guess who back in the motherfucking house

With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth

Hoes recognize, niggas do too

Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo

What you gon do? You really don't know

So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe

Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch

Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip

Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger

How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop

Doggy, I'm all the above

I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes

But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it

Cause you know I don't love em



Whoa!

Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow

One for the money, two for the bitches

Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches

In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact

With bitches on my side, and bitches on back

So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get

Off your knees and then start juggling

These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout





It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none"

You can tear her linin out, what you whinin about

You want the presence of pimpin, I'm walkin while limpin

And holding on the drink that I'm sippin, I'm flippin the script an'

I'm sliding while I'm dippin my whip in, out of traffic

Basically around the burbs I'm fitting like a lego block, you bullshitting

While I'm sitting in an eight o drop, these suckers tell me keep it gangsta

But they don't know, when they ain't looking I be doing population control

Then I'm looking for a breezy with a whole lot of soul so I can have a malfunction in my wardrobe

To not the jada with the ?, its the Jada with the fo' fifth, clutchin on the fifth

With Snoop be in the front and his jewelry shining all through his clothes and little tigger's

In the back on the low, but I still shine though

Uh ya, uh like a African diamond that's deeper than rapping and rhyming

Success happens with timing, over here I'm doin low with the punk

When I'm over there I'm in the low low with my unc and all the bitches

Looking for us but I ain't looking for puss, right now ma I'm looking for cush

And I'm strapped with the pound and ? shoes, cackies, T shirts

Uh uh after my surrounding, air force ones, jeans, city lab

A fitted that's when I'm back in the town and don't get it confused

I'm proud to be gone, be home in a year with duffel bags out on the lawn

So much money my niggas be counting it wrong, so many hits

I can't keep count of the songs and we still grindin, stainless still nine

And ya'll still hate but we still shining let's go

Geah, first of all

Givin honor to God, and all the ministers on the pulpits

Ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir

They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?

Sing it sister..

Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&G

Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece

Such a, heavenly experience

Alchemist, break it down for me nephew

Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch



[Snoop Dogg]

In the beginning as a child I was chosen

Though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened

Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog

Love was given to all, outside livin the ball

As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message

to reach teachin the masses, I wrote my first passage

It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap

I'm young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin

and dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of niggaz around you

Once you get on top they down you

But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin

I found myself grindin on the streets quite often

With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin

At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside

Where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the G-ride

Niggaz throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs

Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine

Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up

Disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin

And then I found out that mom wasn't playin

Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand

Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man

Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with

Through the stripes still gotta shine my light

I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg

Just a block and a phone call away

I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist

I'm preachin just what I practice

To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe

Man woman young and old

Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite

Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light cause I love you



[singers - repeat in background of Outro w/ ad libs]

{I love, to give you light)



[Outro: Minister]

And the people that is locked up, locked down

And the people that's locked dowwwwwn

Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade

On 24's, with the spinnin thangs, ha ha

I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors

Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin to heaven huh

And you ain't gon' go!

So I need you right now to, look at your neighbor

and say neighbor, say NEIGH-BOR, YOU AIN'T GOIN!!

YOU AIN'T GOIN!!"

Huh?



[Snoop Dogg]

I don't say much

I don't say Alize, no I don't say Dutch

Keep yo' hands off until I say, okay touch

I never come off tacky, I'm a boss exactly

I'm like the slick suit Snooperfly Versace

Conversation flashy, y'all niggaz can't match me

I talk to you slow, so your game can roll

Take advice from a player, don't love her just play her

Boy I never could dare, to pay double the fare

Man I swear to God it's gon' be some trouble in here

Before I pay that bitch, I'm like a bossy hog

Half dog, half gorilla, bitch Donkey Kong

Niggaz thirst for hoes, I got a thirst to ball

Tryin to knock a pimp's hustle, be the first to fall

Fuckin with a-hundred-fifty, whole can of vodka

Mixed with gangbang, got a program like Poppa (hey hold up man)

I'ma do you a favor, let this pimpin save ya

Leave that bitch alone, the homies call her Ms. Behavior

Boy you move too fast, done too much talkin

I'm too much walkin to one who keep hoes hawkin

Don't fuck with Snoop too much cause he goes off when

niggaz mouth too much, so please no flossin

I step up quicker, cause the game don't pause

I gotta stay sucka free, cause it ain't no laws

Dig this y'all

That's the bidness mayne, step my game up up in this mayne

Long hours hard minutes mayne, with this hustle on splendid mayne

Yeah, real bossy like, and sometimes flossy

And if you fuckin with that

{""I-I know, I, I-I-know, I know you gonna dig this""}



I had to tell you the truth homey, but you got mad

Yeah I hurt yo' feelings, FUCK IT, it's too damn bad

I'm a major player, I got major game

I might floss a different bitch, but the pimpin the same

I ain't got time for no haters, I lay 'em flat on they back

I'm from the Dogg Pound homey, I don't fuck with them cats

I fuck with, niggaz, who be bustin them shots

I'm talkin Long Beach, Inglewood, Compton, Watts

Close your chops, I knows your spots

Keep talkin nigga I'll expose your knots

You ain't ready for daddy, boy I do this for fun

It's like you versus Kobe ballin one on one

You ain't got no chance, you ain't got no fans

I kick the shit out you punk, look momma no hands

I'm not a, holy roller but I pray so hard

Help me, I'm sendin these bitch niggaz straight to God

Shit I'm too damn grown, conversation is sho't

While your talk is funny, Jack I talk with money

Keep the chain on bling, the rock is sunny

For you smart mouthted bitches I ain't that dummy

[Verse - Snoop Dogg]

Roll up a fat one and pass it around

Lay back hypnotized by The Neptunes sound

My peoples always see me and they think I'm on point

So they roll me a blunt, or either pass me a joint

I'm the modern day Rick James, yeah that's me

Anything less than the best is blasphemy

So ask for me - when you wanna get spliffted

I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted

Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics

This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted

With the berries and cherries, the high berries

The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!

I took another hit and then my vision got blurry

I had to pass this shit in a motherfucking hurry

I'm looking at this chick, real thick, her name is Cheri

Big fat booty and her pootie was hairy, c'mon biatch!



[Chorus]



[Verse - Snoop Dogg]

Nick nack patty wack, give a Dogg a bone

Naw don't gimme nothing but a handful of stones

Don't stop! I ain't finised yet

You say you got the bomb? You wanna make a bet? it's on!

I blew about three zones then took baby home

Nigga what?! Motherfucker I'm grown

I have it how I want it, did it done it and stunted

Fronted a hundred to my nigga cause he want to get blunted

Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it cause I'm wit it

This is the Face Off, the one hitter quitter

It'll lay you on your back fast, sweat start to trickle

Everything is moving like you on a tricycle

You caught up in the pickle but I get you out

I blow you a charge through your nose, not your mouth

Slow down! hoe damn! you're doing too much

You're supposed to take two puffs then give the shit up, c'mon!



[Chorus]



[Verse - Snoop Dogg]

Yeah this is classic, fantastic, I'm blasted

I've been growing and blowing, niggaz wonder how I lasted

Well, like Jesus I fasted, for 40 days and 40 nights

I got it all mastered

Now I need a hit of that, Neptune-ology

Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be

Real high, whenever writing my novelty

Because it adds to my celebrity

So I celebrated, teledated, innovated, dominated

Orchestrated, situated, petuated, reinstated

Then I created, you're happy that I made it

Take another hit, young nigga get faded

We're going all out, smoke till ya fall out

D-O double G House all in ya mouth

The West got the best, the East got the peace

I'm out and about with a blunt in my mouth, peace!

Four hoes on a black tryna put their bid in

Girl, put it to work, you gon' do the damn thing

One hundred percent, pimp-motion, that's the deal

Like a star slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky
Tumbling through space
When you touch my hand
I swear I feel like I'm ballin'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin');

Yeh ballin'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin');

Like a wheel

Whirling round and round

Rolling down a hill (rollin' down a hill)

Spinning on the ground (rollin' down a hill)

Your kissing makes me dizzy yeh

In the head (ooh yeh)

And I'm ballin'

I'm ballin'



[Verse 1]

Hmm, I love this game coz this game love me back

I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac

Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track

The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that

Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars

Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier

Hell yeh you are, yeh you are

Say it say it, coz they all deny it

Player play it, coz you cant deny it

As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know its the shit

It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch

Switch back to the old school, old fools know

This here thang we do so original

I got to have it, lavish

Is how we establish

On the real love one it feels good to have



[Chorus 2]

Like a rose, flippin down the street

Looking oh so sweet (lookin' oh so sweet)

Bumpin to the beat (bumpin to the beat)

These streets they keep me busy yeh

Makin' bread

And I'm ballin'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin');

Yeh ballin'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin');

Oh here I go!

Ballin making dough

Working for myself

Coz it thrills me so

I keep women on my line

Coz they know

That I'm ballin'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin');

Yeh ballin'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin');

Oh here I go!

Driving down the road

Yeh ballin'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin');



[Verse 2]

Do that, who that, you that one they called on

Now you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the cha-cha

And once my small kitchen ?throw?

Watch out, no need to pull your glock out

It's a players affair, now

Look at my hair and the girls wit me

They got the same thang on

Pimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on

Coz my uncles about to get their sang on

And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song

And when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'

[Chorus 3]

He starts to mill

Just rollin' tru his town

Stacking dollar bills (stacking dollar bills)

Raising dogg pound (he be raising the dog pound)

Becasuse he's loved

Loved in every city

Thats why he's ballin'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin');

Yeh ballin'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin');



[verse 3]

There it is coz it is there

Now have a seat and come hit the game from a player

They say time brings change and change brings time

It's so genuine and so divine

It's been so long in fact its overdue

Now tell me baby girl what can D-O-DOUBLE-G do for you

I fell for you, I'll always look over you

So quit stallin' and fallin'

And come get a bar of some of this ballin'

Now quit stallin' and callin'

And come get yaself a bar of this ballin'

Thinkin of a master plan

Cause ain't nuttin but sweat inside my hand

So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent

So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint

So I, start my mission, leave my residence

Thinkin how can I get some dead presidents

I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid

So I think of all the devious things I did

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin funny

Stop smilin, cause still don't nuttin move but the money

Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous

I feel great, so maybe I might just

Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive

Then maybe I'll stay alive

So I walk up the street, whistlin this

Feelin out of place cause man do I miss

A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of

Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of

Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thang

But without no money man that shit's a dream

Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid

So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made

Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull

I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full [echoes]

If she chose to ride wit a G

Then let her ride wit a G

Let the ho be what she wanna be

A real slut, and let the ho get on and make her money

You understand? I got a homey sittin' by me

Understand this nigga don't understand because he's a young nigga

What she do, she jumped out of her sleep and left the pad at a quarter to two

That's on you, you shoulda put your foot in her ass, like a pimp's supposed to do

But instead of goin' 'upside da head'

You bought her a 5 karat wit your bread

And then she went and gave her homeboy Ted some head

I ain't tellin' on her, I'm just sayin', what you do

When your bitch out of bounds and you don't know what to do

What we do, we check 'em from the gate, to keep a bitch straight

It's on you, see you can take her out and buy her all types of things

You's a fool, cause when she leave you, for what he do

You'll see fool

Me and you, that's what you thought 'til your ass got caught

Shame on you, and now I understand why my momma used to tell me that

Ain't that true, you can't make a queen out a motherfuckin' hoodrat

Game on you, cause now you back at your momma house

And you sleepin' on tha copeasack

What's she do, I gave her the keys to my '74 Cadillac

Say it ain't true, she let a nigga drive it, ask tha homie Battlecat

Whatchu do, put my foot in her ass and mashed tha gas

You know me, and ever since that day my nigga, I've been P I M P

I love you, you shouldn't a told her that, you should a smacked her flat

Shame on you (shame on you), your so in love you fittin' to get a tattoo

Lime green and gold, we was sharp to death

Had to catch my breath, watch my step

And call a timeout, before you put your dime out

Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out

And go to the ""Wizard of Oz""

And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart

A brand new start

Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part

And that was smart

It's like a art the way I articulate

And break these bitches from state to state

See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate

I ain't ask for it homie I just shake and bake

I won't fake to make you buy my tape

I say a prayer to the Lord just to keep my faith

Fuck straight

Best kept secret so I'm want up

I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7

Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven

Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks

And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock

Never looking back uh uh, a steady process

And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed

It's like I'm happy now, cause I'm a family man

You the real, you never will slow me up

And you was always on my mind

Say no more

I still miss you at times

All of a sudden you lost my interest

I packed it up and set about my business

You used to have a hold on me

Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me

I kept going to jail and all that

Get out, fuck with you again, I'm right back

I guess I had to learn the hard way baby

I'm leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy (I miss that bitch)

My mamma ain't raise no fool, she love me

That's why she hide my tool inside her room

Me and my nigga, my nerve, my kinfolk

You want a problem, then lets go

Cause if not I came to disco

And freak this ho from Acopoqo

And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride

Let's go we hit the hood slow

Post up, set up shop and press four

Who got the best flow, who got the most dough

Who got the best hoes, nigga you know

Shit its been ten years since I hit some cess smoke

But I still rock a mean coat on the West Coast

In the summertime

And I crumble mine down to the dandelion

Nigga watch how I handle mine

Spiritual, hear we go, hear this

Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless

Square biz, you know what time it is

I'm cool on these niggas but I'm hard on a bitch

Now check dis, fact is

Go head wiggle it round you feeling me now

Girlfriend, you killing them now

[Snoop Dogg]

A day in the life, of a Rollin 20 Crip

I'm just a stuburn type of fella with a head like a brick

And just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless

But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness

Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip

Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip

I bust a funky composition that's smooth as a prism

Now check it as I kick off in this funky ass rhythm

It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck

And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set

Aww nah, Dogg aint this y'all

I got couple relatives up off of Crenshaw

This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all

I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs

Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Reel, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face

And the homie Har'ron rest in peace

Big Jay from Cappinella Park

He used to blaze with his nephew after dark

On and on, rocking big neck bone

Mausberg I had to put you on my song

It's so real, I had to show some love

Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood

It's about you bein jealous of what I does

Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast

in the paint playin post - I back you down

like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy

And skirt up, bust ya boulevard

I'm not Xzibit, you can't +Pull My Hoe Card+

.. I fucked all your groupies

When you was doin time in Camp Snoopy

With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches

And you was payin niggaz off with all my riches

You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?

Oh I know (bitch!)

But I walk the mainline everytime I go down

You can check my G files I do it L.B.C. style

.. I got the word on your Simon

You need to just start rhymin

Cause you the biggest star on your label

And them other niggaz just crumbs off my table

You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop

And I still ain't been paid, for ""1-8-7 on a cop""

I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit

if you keep talkin shit on Crip!



[Hook 1: repeat 2X]

It all boils down to the fact

that you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)

It all boils down to the fact

that you're jealous of my paper stack (gon get pimp slapped)



[Hook 2: repeat 2X]

Money, I get it, paper I got it

Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em



[Snoop Dogg]

If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous

And I'll be spending money out the anus

Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level

Man you worser than devils

Alotta niggas should've said it, fuck em

But Ima say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em

This nigga's a bitch like his wife

Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life

And I'ma let the whole world see

Cos you fucked up the industry, and that's on me

We can go head up, nigga, set it up

Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up

Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up

Cos I'll fuck every last one of em up, especially Kurupt

See that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up

He better keep it Crippin, and slip his clip in

Cos these niggas trippin, this is official business

Do the same way, leave no witnesses

This is that unexpected diss directed, sprayed, covered and protected

Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it

It's all to the good again

You can catch Snoopy Dibby Double in the hood again

Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit

To make the whole world feel it

So put the bacon in the skillet, and try to peel it

Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga

since, I believe, and I think any person - reasonable person would

believe, that that is not covered, in the definition of sexual

relations I was given - ahh - I'm not going to answer it except to

refer to my statement. I had intimate, contact with her that was

inappropriate - I do not believe any of the contacts I had with

her violated the definition I was given; therefore I believe I

did not, do anything but testify truthfully on these matters.

I see you with me forever

We can do things that you never,

Thought you could've

Up out the hood-uh

Is where I took you

Never overlooked you

I can't believe that you shook to another spot

And left me cold, now I'm hot

I'm tryin' to find you, what am I to do?

I gave you everything that you needed



[Refrain]



[Snoop Dogg]

You know what girl?

I was in love with you and you treated me like that,

But you know what they say?

What goes around comes around



[Butch Cassidy]

How could, how could, you do me wrong?

You be messin' up my songs

Now a nigga must move on

Gave love, and you just, straight played on me

Had a nigga sick for weeks

Now I must begin my streak"

I am Sir Dogg, DPG fuck... and I hate water.
I never learned to swim....
AAAAH! PUT ME DOWN!!!! Let go of my leg!!!
I HATE WATER!!!! I CAN'T SWIM!!!! AAAAH!!!!!

(Snoop)

Now matter where I go, you got'cha eyes on me,

And everybody sittin' around waitin' on me,

Show us how you do it Uncle Snoopy,

So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggaz gon' respect me,

Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl though,

Gettin' interviewed by mothafuckaz like Geraldo,

And niggaz wanna know if I smoke Newports or Marlboros?

Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?

I make dat shit for the realest of millions,

While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin',

Hmm... and oh what a relief it is,

That Snoop is back in dis mothafucka handlin' his biz,

Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit,

There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz

So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes,

And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow,

Fuck these niggaz and peep out Whitey Ro (?),

Somebody told? Well then, somebody gettin' rolled on,

And that's usually how the scenario rolls on,

Baby girl said she wanna keep her clothes on,

She either fuckin' gettin' stole on or gotta stroll home,

Well number one, keep your hand on your gun,

And don't (don't) trust (trust) anyone (anyone, one, one.....)



Ohh... you can't trust nobody baby.... you can't even trust your own Mama!!!

This is Snoopy Collins.... trust no one.... especially a bitch....

Or even a bitch-ass nigga.... Yo Ha!!!!



T-R-U-S-T in me, I'm sexy but I'm pussy,

The homies in the hood call me Lil' Bo Peep,

And you da type a nigga I been dyin' ta meet,

So Snoopy, what'chu tryin' to do?

Now hold on lil' mama, ain't no reason for me to lie to you,

Now what I'm tryin' to do, and what I'm gon' do,

Is hit this bud, I got a wife at home,

Bitch I ain't lookin' for none, you might got kids for cuz, or down wit' bud

Pushin' them dubs, look here cuz,

Lemme tell you how it's gon' be

If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me

I'm tellin' you the good-god truth, you want proof?

Ask them hoes over there, ""Y'all wanna fuck Snoop?"" (yeah!)

We'll take the money and the game away,

I bet they won't say the same that day,

But it's okay, cuz I don't trip,

Cuz ""Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks"",

I thought I told you, bitch I'm a soulja,

East side, long beach, gang-bang roller,

From the solar, cuz this, is it,

Can ya dig it? (I can dig it!!!)

Jelly Roll pulled a rabbit out his hat,

I pull a strap out my mothafuckin' back (Aaah!), cuz I know it's like dat,

I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread,

They want a contract on a nigga till' I'm dead,

If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds,

They struck me out, now I'm pinch-hittin' for the Reds,

But I'm a Dodger blue, so I gotta keep it true,

I gotta home-run, nigga we long gone,

I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin',

Rip-ridin', put mines in,

Takin' this game to the next level,

Trustin' no one, especially them Red Devils,

Keep ya head level, hand on my get-up,

Stay on the red-up, pimpin' ain't easy, but there's a whole lot of fed-up,

And like I told you from the get-go, don't trust no one (no one, no one),

And like I told you from the getti, don't trust no one...



(Alien)

OH NO!!! YOU DID IT AGAIN!!!! PUT ME DOWN!!!!

I HATE WATER, I CAN'T SWIM!!!! I NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM!!!!

I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED YOU!!!! I PUT ALL OF MY TRUST IN YOU!!!!

Yo.. uh-huh
I'ma try somethin different on this right here
but I know y'all gon' feel it
cause I know y'all feel me
It's some real shit right here, y'knahmsayin?

I ain't never did it like this before

Check this out..



[Snoop - singing]

I'm the kind of G that everybody knows

But I'm so low-key, when it comes to hoes

I never break the rules and that's just how it goes

All my friends and foes - know that's just how it goes

I can flip the script but I chose not to this time

There's so much to say with so little time, but I like it

(Yes I like it)

I'm gon' dip dive socialize and get high

I wish my people had, other ways

I'm thankful, that a brother's paid (that a brother's paid)

But how can I be happy? My hair is still nappy

I miss my grandpappy

I wanna do right but the world is wrong

That's why I'm singin this song



[Chorus]

I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song

Y'all niggaz better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)

I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)

I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song

You bitches better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)

I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)



[Snoop - singing]

There's so much goin on out there in the world today

All these - ladies, players, gangsters, and suckers

I get caught up sometimes, some of the people I hang with

they turn out to be snitches, bitches, yeah they switches

But you know like I know I can't stop doin, what I got to do

I'ma keep doin what I got to (I'ma keep doin) y'know!

Everywhere I go, the game is the same

People lookin at me want me to say somethin

want me to do somethin, but I don't know nuttin

If I ain't gettin paid, I can't drop no rhymes

I can't do nothin for you no mo', I ain't got that kinda time

and they know..



[Chorus] w/ minor variations



[Snoop - singing]

I try to be to myself, and try to stay.. away from the world

But the world just keeps runnin after me (runnin after me)

I try to shield myself away from all the wickedness

but somehow, the wickedness is in my circle - what am I to do?

I try to ask God to help me get through this

what am I to do to this? Just do this, let's do this

So I, continue to mash, day by day (day by day)

I continue to play, play by play

And I con-tinue to spit my manuscript (spit it)

and say what I want to say (say it)

And I do it to ya ev-ery-day



[Chorus] w/ minor variations



[Snoop Dogg]

Leave me alone, I think you better leave me alone

Leave me alone, leave me alone - better leave me alone

If it don't pay you wrong, leave me alone

I think you better leave me alone, leave me alone

Leave me alonnnne, leave me alonnnne

If it don't pay you wrong.."

Roll a joint, in the bathtub gettin head

Put the G in the P, flipped the G to a ki

Put the West coast back on the map bay-bee

Check my styles, check my files

I've been gangbangin since I was a juvenile

They cut me loose in nine-deuce I swore to tell the whole truth

Keep it gangbang 100 proof

E'rybody say, ""Ay Snoop"" - did Death Row pay me?

Look here young loc, shit it's all to the gravy

I really can't trip off the past, on the real I had a blast

Tupac, rest in peace and God bless all my enemies

Windows on tint, ridin like the President

It's evident, shit I'm doin good (yeah)

I moved out the hood like I should (say what?)

And then they had the nerve to call me Hollywood (nigga what?)

But I don't give a fuck, if I'm misunderstood

20 Crip don't slip, yeah it's all to the good

Yeah the homies got twist too, whatchu say?

Oh the homies might get me? They'll get you

Listen here, don't try it, and don't deny it

And don't pay 'em no mind Dogg, man I'm tryin



{Chorus w/ variations}



{Snoop Dogg}

Just when you thought I was gone, I'm back on

Knick-knack-paddy-wack give the Dogg a home

with a gang of pitbulls, rottweilers and doberman pinschers

Bonafied killers

The illest, cap peelers, that you ever wanna meet

Straight up out the ghetto where they pack the heavy metal

I got my hand on the wheel, my foot on the gas pedal

I'm drivin DoggHouse to the next level (woof)

and buckin two shots at the devil

Run up on his ass, and blast, like a rebel

Turn up the treble cause I hit you with the bass

Remember my name and remember my face

Remember these words, and remember the taste

And remember, we all gotta leave this place

I'm tryin to stay focused, I'm the loc'est in the game

The Rap Prime Minister, ""Mr. G Thang""

Fuckin with the wrong folks, messin with my spread

On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, peep game
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad

I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors

And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores

My brothers, they used to boast and brag:

""We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!""

And even worse than that, to make me feel low

They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows

Girls used to say, ""Snoop, you're so cute

But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit""

Welllll, one day, up the Avenue

There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew

He said ah, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!

The princess is having a royal ball

If you can rap, also dress fresh

You might win a date with the sweet princess""

Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash

I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad

I said, ""Step-dad, may I?""

And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied (Cinderfella!)

My brothers were goin, they were gettin down

Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)

They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted

""We can and you can't,"" is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah)

They all stood there, laughin in my face

And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!""



(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love



Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss

And I'd get them back if I had one wish

Before I could make my thought a phrase

There appeared a man from a puff of haze

He said, ""What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb

I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!

Now I've came here with the main purpose

Of granting you your fondest wish""

I said, ""Herb, my man, just make me fresh

And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest""

With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot

And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit

On my feet was some white tube socks

And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock

I showed him my sack, and don't you know

With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe

Once again his hands began to flow

Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)

He checked me over, passed me the keys

And said, ""One more thing before you leave...

You must return before the stroke of twelve

Or you'll turn back into your old self""



(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love



I jumped in the low-low and went on my way

I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say

It was after eleven when I rocked the mic

And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!)

The princess was starin, while holdin a drank

Reflected from her eyes was gold tank

She waved her hands like, ""Hello! Hi!""

Then gave another gesture like, ""Come here, guy!""

I left the stage, girls came in flocks

The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks

I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock

Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock

No time to waste, I broke out in haste

The princess followed in a futile chase

A quick steady pace is what I kept

Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps

For the six-fo' I continued my stride

About this time I heard gong five

I was down the block when I heard gong eight

And the princess screamed out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!""



(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love



I was almost home when my luck ran out

And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout

My fresh low-low, also went too

And there was no denyin that my night was through

The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported

Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded

Made it to my pad, no time at all

Went to my room, or better yet the far wall

Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased

Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's

Early the next mornin, when I awoke

I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat

Slid into the front, my family stared at me

Sayin, ""Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be""

They kept askin me if I did my chores

My butt was saved by a knock at the door

""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked

""The princess,"" this sweet voice remarked

She said she was lookin for a certain man

Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand

The family ran around with their heads in the air

Bringin her shoes from everywhere

She just shook her head, a nod of relief

And said, ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief""

I ran in the room and got my shoe

And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""

Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute

But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?""

I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light

And I was wearin shit, from just last night

Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'

Yelled to my family, ""I've GOT to go!""

We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I

And in back of me, I heard my family cry...

Ya'll get my ash tray, get my lighter.
I'm a read ya'll a gangsta bedtime story.

Come here, sit on my lap.

(Okay.)

Check it out.



Great scotts, it's hot today

He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest

He fell to the floor with his hands in the air

His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care

Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck

So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck

Shooting like a muthafuckin vietnam vet

Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set

No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots

On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop

You better have a spot up in town my nigga

Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga

Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat

Grease strikes you out with no get back

Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat

And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that

Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me

Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me

We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all

Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em

LBC in this muthafucka cuz

I had to show these niggas what time it was

We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns

We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves

Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip

Or better yet, strapped a clip

To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater

And put the ride down out of G two seater

You need a nigga like me to get your game like that

Young nigga, you could get a smack for that

I'm that nigga who brought the afro back

And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack

Before I came out niggas was wearing slack

I brought the curl back and the golf hat

The black poker sack and this skandelous raps

The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks

I brought snaps to the game nigga

Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga

S-N double O-P fa sho

I do my thang way cut throat on the downlow

Oh once upon a time in the LBC

There lived a OG from the DPG

And all the little kids looked up to him

All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him

But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel

And all they hated on him because he was way to real

I don't know why but he's just so fly

But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight"

Worldwide, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing

Playin football up in Powly High

Too young to ride but it's still Eastside

Homocides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much

It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up

Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end

So next year we can do it all again

Same dogg channel, same dogg time

Only the strong will survive in 99

So much drama and dillusion, my conclusion is confusing

Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music

Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it

Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it

It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising

And Eastside niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)

But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest)

Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine

Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime

Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime

Be smart, fresh start is all you need

First thing first, cuz, stop smoking cess weed

You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating

That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating

But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say

But somehow someway, better days ahead, Freddy's dead

And Betty said Eddie's a fed

Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head

And he fuckin with this hoodrat that he met up in dance

Betty gettin mad cause Eddie wanna share

But look at how you livin for a minute then compare

I love confetti, I always stay ready

Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli

I'm ready to do now, who now, you now

Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow

Two down, with just one gun

My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun

I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone

Live the life of Al Capone or Don Coroleone

Tragically casulties and fatalities

And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me

My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said

Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead

I never really understood what he said

Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head

Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson

Slow down and go down, shit you know now



Be smart, fresh start is all you need

First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed

You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating

That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating

But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say

But somehow someway, you got to make a better way



(Somehow someway)

You got to make a better way

(You got to make a better way)

You got to make a better way

(You got to make a better way)

You got to make a better way

(You got to make a better way)

You got to make a better way

(Yeah, better days ahead)

Better days ahead

(Better days ahead)

Better days ahead



That's real.

I feel your pain nigga.

I used to be just like you nigga.

Before I got off in this rap shit.

Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar.

You know, but one thing I never did do.

I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing.

I went out and got my own ya feel me?

So from me to you, man to man.

Better days ahead my nigga.

Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on.

Cause I'm a get mine regardless.

Nigga wether I'm rapping or on the streets.

I gotta have it."

And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up

She actin like that hair's hers but you know what's up

Say she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much



I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb

I told em ""Hit the side and slide and get the herb""

But guess who's callin, Pipedream Patty

Made that nigga park my whoride beside the alley

Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)

Fuck that nigga yo

But I can't forget about him cuz he taught me everything I know

Oh no Joe, walkin down the wrong lane

Tootin on that cocaine, fuckin wit that wrong thang

Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)

Then fake the funk, doggonnit

You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit

Niggas like you, used to be in my crew

Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to

I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew

That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce

Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend

Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in

I believe in, sharin the cock

Also, I believe in comparin the cock

Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)

Not just knee deep, she was totally deep

When she went down on me

She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off

Ooh wee, baby you's a freak

Put my homey up on game like a gangsta

But my homey fell in love and he banked her

Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist

Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist



Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back

And he get his third strike wit no get back

Say he doin too much, yeah homey you doin too much

And when the homey in the pen, doin a sin

And his girlfriend fuckin wit his best friend

Say she doin too much, hell yeah she doin too much



I'm livin up in the hills, wine sippin wit mills

I'm havin major type of paper, I ain't trippin off bills (still)

Show me some respect and accept my coolness

And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish

Use this as a warning, cuz I'm startin

To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin

Pardon me, cuz I ain't mad when you get bent

But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. ?spray?

Friends and family, gettin after me like repo

Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note

You doin too much when you clutchin on my touch-tone

Callin strays over nigga leadin months gone

Conversate for fo' hours, wastin mo' power

And only get to hit a cold shower

You fakin like you're makin more moves than Simpson

But frontin, pushin buttons, doin nuttin but sin



And when a nigga on yo' phone, runnin up yo' bill

You know he doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much

And when your baby momma cryin bout she need some milk

Westcoast nigga, Quik and Snoop Dogg (Forever)

9-9 nigga



When I wake up in the morning and I get up out my bed

I feel good, o yes I do

Cause I still can give it up for you



Chorus

Cause we're all a little strong

In the Beach, where the paper's long

But as for me

I only G when I'm buss'n rocks

Dogg Pound

{repeat}



{Verse One:}

Nigga, you know you gotta have heart

I told you niggas from the start

If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life

Always stay down and keep my motha fuckin' game tight

Cause ever since Elementary, or was it Pre-school Quik?

I was a motha fuckin' fool

I had to have papers it was routine

A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens

I, shake niggas

Break Niggas

Make niggas, shank theyselves

For fuckin with my wealth (nigga)

And it'll catch on

Cause if it don't, it's on

And, cuzz, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone

Sittin' back loungin' in the Chronic Zone

Clown me ya gone

Surround me, it's on

Get the money you're gone

My niggas' paper so long

They call him Snoop Capone

So if you want me, get me, got me

Should have shot him

But now they call me Snoop Gotti

And that's all I LBC

Betta yet, that's all I DPGC



{Chorus (2x)}



{Verse Two:}

I'm slappin' bones

In front of my home

Choppin' game on the phone

Smokin' a zone

Big 6, big 5-3's with ya bitches

My girls in the kitchen, cookin' up some fish and

I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'

O, knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'

But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck

I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet

Dead, gone, light's out

With no remorse, I had to take him out

I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny

Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money

And then I dip to my spot (dip dip)

And set up shop with yo rocks (motha fucka)

And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7

Cause still, all doggs go to heaven



{Chorus (2x)}



{Verse 3:}

I'm freestylin'

C-stylin'

Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island

Where the bitches and the bud come free

And everybody listen to the D-O double G

Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts

People be lovin' me because I drop cuts

That makes sense, it make big money

See Snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny

But I got yo honey, up under my wing

Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing

I'll put her in a cling

I won't buy her a ring

But I'll put her on the hoe-stroll to make me some green

And even if she never even saw me befo'

There's just no way that she can tell me no

You know my game's unbelievable baby (uh uh, uh uh)

And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me

{Snoop}

Yeah, I love my momma

I love you momma, I love my momma -- I love you momma

I love you momma (I love you momma)

I love my momma (I love you momma)

I love my momma (now you tell em Snoop)



You taught me how to read and write, how to fight

My do's and dont's, my wills and my wont's

I'll never forget, the things that we went through

Bangin oldies in the livin room, sippin brew

Schlitz Malt Liquor was the thing back then

My momma was my homey my daddy, and my best friend

Ask the Twinz, them my lil locos to the end

And Warren G and Nate Dogg, shit them my true friends

Time and time again, I'ma spit this rhyme again

She the queen in my life, and I'ma make sure she gon' shine again

She taught me everythang, but she didn't charge a fee

She taught me everythang, except how to see a G

For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me

instead of the other way around, and I put that on Dogg Pound

I made you cry, you made me smile

I just wanna say I love you for life

and that's the reason why I'm here now

Love, Snoop



I love my momma, yeah..

I love my momma (I love you momma)

Yeah, I love my momma (I love you momma)

Through all the drama, yeah, yo, yeah, I love you (I love you)

Momma, momma, momma, momma, I love my momma

Momma, I love you momma

I love you momma

Momma, momma



{singer}

Your money wasn't always long (fo' sho');

But your heart was forever strong (momma.. momma..)

You taught me bout faith and hope

And never ever get hooked on dope

Momma.. (I love you, I love you momma)

I love you momma.. (throught all the drama, I love my momma)

At ease
I would like to welcome the newest No Limit Soldier
Mr. Snoop D-O Double G, and he brings to the tank
Money, power, respect, leadership, street knowledge and wisdom
AHH YAH...D.P.G., yah D.P.G.

Pop the Champaign

Once you break this of you can't get twisted

So pay attention and listen



[Chorus]

Welcome to my world nigga, and its V.I.P

And the bitches and the bud for free (6x)



[Snoop]

Welcome to this world that you never thought existed

And you got to be a soldier to be inlisted

Listen, IM gunna take your mind, your body and your soul

On a whole lil' trip just don't loose your grip

Wait a second (Wait a second), were is the sack

You don't have to ask no questions just jump in the back

And leave your strap, cus there ain't none of that

Were we goin', it ain't nuthin' but 808, beats and flauntin'

Niggas showin' niggas love, hoes suckin' dicks

That's how we do it, cus everything is in the mix

Doggy Land, Doggy World, Snoop World whatever

It don't matter cus we 'bout it, and homies down to do whatever

Everything is legit, and the bitches the shit

And niggas they give you love, cus dey down for it

Now that's just how it goes, and all the hoes on me

And everything is V.I.P, and that's on D.P.G

Now nigga creep in, just like a liquor store

Now nigga if you want a hoe, nigga just let me know

I'll send a H, and when she gets you (got you)

She with you forever, and a day, that's the D.P. way



[Chorus x 5]



[Snoop]

Wipe your feet before you enter in

Now take a seat and peep dis beat and sip yo' gin

Cus ain't no killin', everybody chillin'

Steady stackin' paper from the floor up to the ceilin'

Now in my world, a bitch is a girl

And mans best friend is his ends, and his mothafuckin' benz

But chall can't get in just cus you all say you chall down wit us

And try to get around wit us, and hang around wit us, and clown wit us

Hold on, this shit here is for the establishment

Niggas that's havin' shit, and if you ain't roll on and stroll on

This is the spot were the bangers at, the slangers at

Were red and blue equals green, and we probably be black

In fact we stack G's for them keys, so when we finished doin' deeds

You all can't believe what we did 

provide an opportunity in the community,

Tryin' to spread a lil' unity between you and me

Since IM the mayor, I think I gotta say-ahh a lil' something

Lets keep it jumpin' playa (playa)

ain't too many places that you know about

So everybody in the world, welcome to the muthafuckin dogg house



[Chorus x 2]



[Master P]

UGGHHHH, picture me ballin' (ballin');

3rd world hustler out the ghetto of New Orleans

Some say life is like a fairy tail (fairy tail)

Did a song with Snoop Dogg, and it turned into a business deal

But it ain't bout da ends, cus we all got matches and we all got benz's

It's about riddin' with the homies (homies)

Gettin rid of the fake and lookin' through the phonies

And the haters can't stop this, check billboards, number one

The only company with a profit, So say Ughh and How You Do Dat There

It's No Limit and D.P.G. nigga we don't care



[Chorus x 4]



[Snoop]

Yah, Snoop World

Home of the No Limit Soldiers, Beats By the Pound

You know how we do dis, ain't no stoppin' this

We can't be stopped, we run da streets

You feel me, da streets is ours

Yah, it's on for life

Yah, gunna drive this tank overseas

{Snoop:}

Life ain't nothing but a big old twist

A lot of times when I'm smoking

I'm doing that just to reminisce

It's funny, on how shit be

A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me

But look here, I work hard for all the things I got

And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot

You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes

And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors

But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc

Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke

Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it with rich niggas

Nigga we seven figure niggas

And we bigger than the biggest hip hop niggas in rap

And when we get to spittin' make sure y'all step back

You with that? Cause if you ain't clown,

We from the D-O double G, we groupie true, and slow down



Slow down (slow down now) cause I can't take the heat, slow down

{Mia X:}

Ayyo Snoop (I used to)

I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas

Know about the hits, hang with killas

Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits

Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga

Have the card parties where the stakes was high

Go shopping hit the club and then ???

Never had a day without no drama

Half the OG's age, but they call me Mama

Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag

Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad

I never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real

Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I

Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord

Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard

And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child

When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down



Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down

(Slow down baby)

It's wicked in these streets (Slow down baby)

Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down

(Slow down, slow down)

It's wicked in these streets



{Mia X:}

Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut

And started putting all this game on records for my come up

From sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money

Hata's ain't gon' stop me cause hatas can't run me

It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul

Every body seemed glad, but now they ?????

Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free

And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down

Snoop:

I got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun

I ????? from these shoulders, I don't need no gun

But it's the nineties, and niggas don't bump by the end of the round

The clown bound to dump, young chump

You don't wanna get caught up in my mix

Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch

We don't neva eva, talk no shit

Unless we mack that shit up, nigga you get lit



Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas

Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down

(I can't take the heat)

It's wicked in these streets (It's wicked in the street)

Slow down, (I can't take the heat no more) cause I can't take the heat

Slow down (I can't take it) it's wicked in these streets

Slow down (slow down) cause I can't take the heat

You ain't gonna realize whats you got till its gone, thats real
You gets no lovin, babe
Girl you know I got you livin plush in the cut
An every time I wanna dig you out

You tell me ""don't rush""

Money stashin, you got me sneakin

An we all alone in the zone, I be tweakin

I almost got caught, my game is lethal

I had to stay at my daddy's house, on the couch last weekend

It's written on my face, an I can't even hide it

So I decided, to ride it

Roses are red, an Violets are blue

Girl you got a nigga hooked, when you do whatcha do when ya do

An now ya want a Benz for ya birthday

An I been waitin to hit that ass since the first day

I'm buyin you gifts, drape'in you out, with gold

I'm showin you love, you's above any other hoe

Tatoo wit my name on your tits

An everytime I dip, I make sure to kick some chips

Now bitch trip



Chorus:

You don't show me some love {show me love, for real, you gets no love, yea}

You gets no lovin babe {you gets no love, you aint gonna miss it till it's

gone} -2x-



An that's on lust, an I trust thats you wont bust under pressure

An I ain't even trip, when you dip wit them chips off the dresser

An you didn't even have to fess up

I just gave you another G, an told you ""pick ya dress up""

For the weddin, the settin was set

40 G's for your ring, you's a Queen sippin Moet

I'm upset, an I don't even want to have jip out

But baby didn't give it to me, ughh

I was down at the alter, I seen Sister Salta

Said ""lady could you pray for me?"" ughh

I'm in a love affair, I can't share, it ain't fair

Because my life is my wife, an that ain't right

Cause I'm a do what I'm suppose to do, an what I was choose to do

Wether it's buyin a house, or car, or some clothes for you

I try to stay tru to it, see I ain't new to it

Thats why I do for you boo, I need love too, three



Chorus -2x- 

Snoop with background chorus -2x-



See I done put it on the line, see this here is genuine

An as long as you with me girl, see everything is gonna be fine

See can't nobody match it, don't touch it, ya might scratch it

This love affiar, it's so original, I call it classic

See I'm attracted, an I'm infacturated

At the same time, belated, an gang related, Dogg Pound on mine

But to fine time to leave all that behind

An tryin to spend some time an give you all of mine {what's that} ya see

I ain't hard to get along with, to do a song with a nigga like D.J. Pooh

Dedicate this whole thing, to a girl like you, boo, look here

You know I'm true, just continue to do me like you want me to do you

An, I hope we don't never have to, write another chapter

Just keep it on the real wit me

Cause I don't really wanna, see you on the corner

Just show a nigga love ya see {gets no love, gets no love}

Check this out
{Snoop Dogg}
Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game

I dust off my knees

I fucked off two g's

Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock

Why? so I can rob every known dope spot

I'm having hard times, grit, and grind

Shit I'm tyring to get mine

Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline

It's a cold twist the way that shit goes

Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo

And keep a down bitch for when your money run out

And get you gun out

And shoot'em up till they come out

I'm blowing in the wind

It feels good my friend

Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in

I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc

A drug dealer at the same time i love to smoke

But if I wasn't in this rap game

Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name



{Chorus Fiend}

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs

And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs

If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed

Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed repeat



{Fiend}

I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?

With this automatic rocket

Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage

Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch

Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips

Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this

Cold blooded killing for ??? this

Soda couldn't rock this

chop a shelf when i drop this

My ??? can't chop this

The hunger that I hold

Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul

See this here with a hole

Allowed that silencer to blow

And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before



{Soulja Slim}

Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja

Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober

I seen my nigga nigga from way way back

Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac

He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin

He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin

And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time

So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???

And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got

And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being

shot



Chorus



{Silkk the Shocker}

Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside

I had 120 dollars, but i spent a 100 on my ride

Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name

Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine

I told him weed charge it 2 the game

Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit

Some slum shit

Some out the projects dumb shit

some weed and blunt shit

Some I don't give a fuck shit, where it from shit

Some penitentiary solitary confinement never see no motherfuckin' sun

Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more

So I tell nigga hit the floor I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick

door

Now whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting

Y'all call me down??? do get scared I ain't flipped till my guns smoking

And it be hard on these streets

Gotta get my hustle on

{Snoop}

Homies all standing around just hanging

Some dope dealing some gang banging

We decide to roll a week deep

Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep

Real slow, in you before you know

I had my double pointing at his window

He got scared and hit the gas

Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass

He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket

We couldn't catch him so I said fuck it

Then we headed right back to ????

Sweating all the bitches in the dazzy dukes

We couldn't no play from the ladies

With seven niggas in a Nav is you crazy

She was scared and it was showing

So we all said ""FUCK YOU BITCH"" and kept rolling

To the hood now we was 'fen to

Find something else to get into

Like some pussy or in fact

Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack

On a nigga cold nutting it off

Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs

I might stumble and still wont lose

Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's

Cause I'm the type of nigga who's quick to blast

Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass

I'm in Junior High with a C+ grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I to school from my moms apartment
I got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit
Cause where I'm at if you soft you lost

And to stay on course, you got to roll with force

My homeboy Dogg is chilling in a Benz

In front of his building witht the rest of his friends

I give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand

He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man

I go upstairs, I hug my mother

I kiss my sister and I punch my brother

I sit down on the bed to watch some t.v.

{Gun Shots} Do my ears decieve me

No That's the fourth time this week

Four young brothers got shot in the street

The very next day while I'm off to class

My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass

My sisters cute but shes got no gear

I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share

So there in school I made a fool

With one and a half pair of pants, you aint cool

Cause there's no dollars for nothing else

I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf

Now everyday I see my momma struggling

So now its time I got to do something

I look for work

I get dissed like a jerk

I do odd jobs

And come home like a slob

So here comes Dogg his gold is shivery

He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery

I do it once I do it twice

And now there's stake with the beans and rice

My mothers nervous but she knows the deal

My sisters gear now has sex appeal

My brothers my partner and were getting paper

And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors

My family's happy and everything is new

Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do



{Chours}

Doggz Gonna Get Ya {x4}



{Mac Talking}

Ay yo yo Check this out Snoop

All these niggas always talking about

""They looove this"" And niggas got looove for you

Or nigga I looove this ride or this chin around my neck nigga

You niggas dont know what the fuck love really mean

Nigga you cant buy love at no corner store nigga

Love aint got no price tag

Snoop I want you to kick this shit to them niggas



{Snoop}

hmm

Money is flowing everything is fine

I bought my self and Uzi and my brother a nine

Business is booming everyhing is cool

I pull about a G a week, fuck school

A year passed by and I began to grow

Not in height but juice and cash flow

I kick up my feet to watch some t.v.

Cause now I got other people working for me

I got a 55"" television you know

And every once in a while I hear ""Just say no""

Or the other commercial I love

That's when they say this is you brain on drugs

I pick up the remote control and just turn

Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned

Me and my brother bounced in the Benz

We driving around our territory again

I pull up at the light like a superstar

An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car

I hit the accellerater scared as shit

I drove one block to find my brother was hit

He wasnt dead but the blood was pouring

And all I could think about was Warren

Later I found it was Dogg and his crew

Now tell mw what the fuck am I suppose to do



{Chours x8}



{Mac Talking}

Yeah so now you see what I'm talkin bout nigga

You see what that love shit do ya

This nigga said he had love nigga and this nigga done shot yo brother

So what the fuck you gone do now



{Snoop}

My brother s out of it but I'm still in it

On top of that I'm in it to win it

I cant believe that Dogg would dis me

That faggot that punk he soft or sissy

I driving around with three of my guys

The war is on and I'm on the rise

We rolled right up to Dogg's favorite hang out

What's cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out

Someone shot back so we took cover

And all i could about was my brother

Dogg jumped up and began to run

Bustin shots hopping to hit someone

So I just stopped and let off three shot

Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop

I threw down the gun and began to shout

""Ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out

Now as I left there goes the boys in blue

They pointin they guns at my four man crew

They shot down one, they shot down two

Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do



{Chours x8}



{Snoop Talking}

Ya see the moral of the story is this

Love is a motherfucka

And Doggs is a motherfucka

You mix the two up you bound to get some drama

{Verse 1: Snoop Doggy Dogg}



Some do the things that they do cos they dumb

and some do the things that they do for crumbs

I do mine for me ya see?

Not the big homey double O-G

Scared to do your own work, man that's fast

and that's the reason why I had to shoot you down

because you never should've tried to work my Dogg

and the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump

Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'

Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!

Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er

few many times too many and became a teller

They sell a nigga dreams if he want em

but they won't sell you the game to get up on em

Ya tryin ta find em cos you want em, they shook out

Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out

it ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga

but it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us

But it's steel, you put it in their head

that at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)



Chorus



{Verse 2: Kurupt}



Aiyo Snoop, why would niggas get into the bracket

and make a loot, niggas want trip

Spittin like ""you spoke beef from the hood

Show me love nigga or don't show me shit""

Feel the fever, million dollar male like Cole Severs

Made a non-believin man into a believer

Receive a cheque the next day, my homies say

""it's the way to get paid"", DP's and pay

I don't know why you wanna get on my back? (why?)

Trippin cos you know the bomb's at where I'm at

Well if that's the case you shoulda roll

wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)

This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue

Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop

Niggas from Seth be tryin to set you cos you settin your ways

so ask DJ Pooh what pays



Chorus



{Verse 3: Snoop Dogg}



Just what we need, bangin on wax another trip

What you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?

You're like a actor wit another script

Predictable as Rambo wit another clip

How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?

You need to sit down and learn to get down first

cos, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers

not part-time FBI singers

Niggas havin bad intentions, sendin BG's on a mission

One move too many, nigga you missin

Listen you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no

loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D

Niggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossin

but guess what it cost em, they crossin me

But before I give a nigga a 9

I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme

I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond

Been workin on ya new album for two years strong

and still can't come up with the right song

You know what they say:'Study long, study long'

All aboard the train so come along

cos we keep the glue stuff against the bone

It's alright ain't no room for wrong

Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home

I got money loads by the barrels

I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro

I'm international money maker, player hater

shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler

at a player though cos players know the real from the fake

You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state

I give you people what you like

What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic

{Verse 3: Snoop Dogg}



Killin up crews, give em the real street blues

Have em slidin in their eelskins, groovin in their tennis shoes

Of course it don't stop bein a Westside ridah

Wit no tattoo that's how they got the clue

I lay conversation on wax and CD's

BG's and o-riginals, here come the mission

Makin biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season

Doggy DPG ya lil homey, uhh

I represent the LBC-ment

Windows tint, nigga that's the president

I hit you with a tune every blue moon

Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face

Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate

It taste like it's laced but it ain't

It remains the same in the year you live in, see
Cos if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in

And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school

When it's time to duel, you get two men

Two heaters, one street, one clock

and when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop

If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue

but if you're too slow

I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)

Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real

I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang

The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit

You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers

Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas

We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes

bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg

Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses

The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen

Searchin for this location on the map

It feels just like it's 1865

and a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

On and on and on it's more strange

Time to heat, shootin range

Quick with the heat on their hip

Young Jesse James come to test your aim

I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral

I hearda ya name

Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie

Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride

From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach

My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts

The off-the-rocker roller coaster

On a six-shooter holster

with DPG on every Wanted poster

Let me think about which bank to gank

which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank

I want all the shit you got in stacks

attached to this skirt in the corner

so I snatched the bitch in the back

The Dogg in me feels for the lust

but the hogg in me makes me wanna bust

Back to the drawin down board

Nowadays we drawn down more

To survive thru all the round wards

Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene

or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen

I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it

With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket

Like that cock back

quick to pull my strap

Just to put the Horsemen on the map

(The gold rush)



{???? from LBC Crew}



Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots

I got the six shots for all the plans and plots

I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags

Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags

I got stacks so my stacks excell

Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells

I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse

A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course

It ain't no stoppin young Josey

Box all the nosey

Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be

Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell

Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele

Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet

Divide between my homies and ride the sunset



{Bad Azz from LBC Crew}



Two sacks o' money from the train heist

They ain't even counted it up

just mounted it up

Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster

Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster

Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat

so I gotta have what I can get

Heard word about the gold rush and headed West

on my white horsey with three straps in my napsack

Giddy up, the next town I rode thru

I had to threaten to blow their city up

Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west

sell us some beads and hail us some weed

He offered me a toke

he didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke

I almost choked

Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset

tryin ta reach my destiny fast

It's these two bags o' cash

44's cocked I ain't makin no mo' stops

till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot

I slid off my boots, counted my loot

Five minutes after the strike of midnight

I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you

Now Sh????, I told the bitch to blaze the weed

Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew

Hey, I got knocked off on the bar

And my room got knocked off in the car

Gave it to me until I reached my peak

Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week

I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast

You've been givin' up too much damn cock and givin up too much ass

Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that

Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back

Ever since she tripped, I went on one

Stepped in the club, Caught me a homerun

Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call

I wanted to break that bitch like a law

Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth

Talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof

Then she said somethin bout the cost

Man, that same bus stop is where

I dropped that bitch back the fuck off

You can't ride my bird

So I kicked that bitch to the curb

You best to believe

You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me



You thought you had my grip

But Soopafly never ever slips

You thought you had my cash

I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute

Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on

Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas

She fly but she wasn't the sexiest

She had a hoe with her named Bama, short for Alabama

A big bad mama-jamma, now look here

I like big bitches cause they large

And big bitches always take charge

Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg

Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll

Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of

Got alot of cash for a little love

All they wanna do is take you down to the mall

Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg

I don't see a god damn thang

That's stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring

It'd look nice on my finger, I'm a buy you a zinger

Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer

Your homegirl, bring her cause I've been dying to meet her

You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her

She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her

But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her...

It was fun while it lasted

You know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby



You thought you had my grip

But Snoop Dogg never ever slips

You thought you had my cash

Until I turned around and whupped your ass

....trick beyotch beyotch

I said beyyyotch, what are you smokin

There must be some kind of misunderstanding

Hit the parking lot, bitch I be standing by the Benz

You think a nigga rich, bitch

Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick

For all the wrong reasons

Niggas ain't trippin' during pimp season

But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway

If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday

I rolled to my house with the bitch

(What'd you do ) introduced her mouth to my dick

Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable

You fuckin' with a dog, bitch you ain't fin' to come up, hoe

So you might as well enjoy the ride

And serve this nigga from the eastside

How much for the game that I'm sellin'

Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen

I know sex sells but I'm a tell you though

Couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable

Fucked all night woke up the next mornin'

Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on

Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent

It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money



You thought you had my grip

But Too never ever slips

You thought you had my cash

Until I turned around and whupped your ass

....trick beyotch beyotch



...I got family members, homeboys...

Muthafuckaz I look out way before you."

For this is the season of catching the vapors
Since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew
What you want on Nate Dogg
Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'

'Ain't No Fun', now check it

Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it

He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam

The type of female wit fly Gucci gear

She wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair

When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess

Talkin about baby please she wrought his service stress

Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer

The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her

But now he wear boots that match with his suits

And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap

And now she stop flautin and won't it speakin

Be comin round the Pound every single weekend

to get his beeper number she be beggin please

Dyin for the day to eat these



She caught the vapors

She caught the vapors



I got a little cousin that's kinda plain

He bring the heeb wit tha beep for the Dogg Pound gang

A mellow type of fellow best laid back

But back in the day he wasn't nuthin like that

I remember when he used to scrap every day

When my auntie would tell him he would never obey

He wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied

And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside

Around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad

Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had

They said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta

Or be there in jail or some other shaker

But now he's grown up to be a surprise

D-A-Z got a hit record slangin world wide

Now the same people that didn't like him as a child

Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle



They caught the vapors

They caught the vapors



I got another homie from tha L-B-C

Known ta yall as D.J. Warren G

He cut grass trasform wit finesse

......... and all that mess

I remember when we first started to rap

He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop

He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said

Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted

Now my homie Warren still tried

On and on and on til the like break of dawn

To work at tha V-I-P would be the link

But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip

Now for the year after Regulate

Warren G is havin papers so my homies write straight

He walked into the same record shop as before

And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store

Offerin him a job but nah he don't want it

Damn it feels good to see people love Warren

Cause I remember when at first they wasn't

Now guess what they call sessy bussin



the vapors

They caught vapors

I got to talk bout me now



Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg

I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog

When I was a teenager I tried to be down

And since they wasn't tryin to hear me I made the Dogg Pound

I saw a crew on 2-1 street

and said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said

no, and treated me like a wet food stamp

after gettin rejected, I ain't runnin upset

I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?' Rhymes at rates

When I used to go to parties, they make me wait

What I have to get on the mic to set M-C straight

I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music

They acted like I wanted to keep hangin with the juzi

But now things switched from West to East

Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?

'We used to see Daz, back in the day'

It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed



You caught the vapors

You caught the vapors

You got the papers"

{Verse 1: Tha Dogg Pound (Dat Nigga Daz, Kurupt)}



Beeyatch! (Beeyatch!)

I come thru with the humps, I thump tha shit out'cha block

I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop

Spot us some hos, tooted my horn at the bitch

??? ever skaty, my team ya's the shit

Fifteen's humpin, dropped the top, she moaned

countin my dough, purchased a 50 of some bomb indo floss

In South Central I'm on my way to the East Side

We high, blazin like crazy, we don't know why

feelin good as fuck on a hot ass day

and it's a pujam right around the way

Niggas got hos but ladies in the world

they wanna play wit their minds like little girls

I twirled my fingers in the air

rubbed my fingers thru my hair

Red bones to black bones

dark bows to red bows

Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen

but I play hos like plenty-leany cos I get greedy

It's all about game cos when the game

is hard to maintain for so long, man

From Long Beach, California, from Tulsa, Oklahoma

Tonight *?warnin the award is?* from Mississippi, I know ya

hold the key to unlock the door

From long clothes she rolls with gold thangs we ridin for sure

So tell me how much money can one playa make? (make)

and how much o' ya ass can one nigga break?

You're just a gigolo (you know)

To the heart you're just gigolo (you know)



I was off in Vallejo

pullin hos like Idaho potatoes

What am I to do when life as a G

bein from where I be, DPG

It's manifico

ran into this pretty ass skirt, Mexican-Puerto Rico

mixed with a sprinkle of black

So I'ma approach her like dat

and let her know where I ride and reside at

My zone the place that I call home

is the Wall from Philadelphia, the room

Picture me ay

entrepenuer with my nigga D-A

Rockin tours and we still young boys

They got bitches, they got some bomb ass niggas

She used ta put em on his bomb ass dick

She always talked some bomb ass shit

She used to blow some bomb ass dick



Chorus



{Bridge: Nate Dogg}



That's right

Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?

Someone wants to score and get laid by the D-O-double G

Hey girl, what's your name? Ya wanna go a couple rounds with me

I told her Nate Dogg is just the same but she kept screamin out Snoopy



{Verse 2: Warren G, Snoop Dogg}



What's up baby, my name is Warren

I'm down with the Pound

cos I get around

So let me scoop you, swoop you and take you

Gimme a chance and I'ma break you

down to the very last compound

with my homies from Tha Dogg Pound



Now you know and I know

Rule number one, you can't trust no ho

Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast

The ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash

You got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos

I bust a brand new ho in every video

That's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow

I pass a ho to my kinfolk

and then smoke

She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy

She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me

Right before she do me, I blaze up a lupi

then turn on some Snoopy and, uhh, heat up jacuzzi

and later on I might just turn on a movie

so you can regroupie and redo me just for Snoopy



{Chorus to fade}



{Outro: Warren G}



There's roaches and shit in this motherfucker in here

I forgot about this"

I hope things get better for you

cos I'ma make things get better for me

We ride at high tide, the East is my side

I'ma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable

Oh yes I'm fresh and like spy from existence

Wit persistence I perceive

to supply you wit what you need, no room for greed

Better go around and when it come to you

don't bite off more than you can chew

Respect the game and the game will respect you back

Game is life, life is struggle

without the coastal juggle

So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal

Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?

On the microphone I bury the bone

Always, strays try to follow me home

Uhh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin doo-doo

I'm steppin on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe

See I'm smashin full-breaded wit no leash

When I mob, make marks across the street

See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail

for the bow-wow LBC style

Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper

On the receiver, go get it like a retriever

I want em close enough so I can lock on em

wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em

Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em

Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten, uhh

We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses

Knockin niggas llike cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin

It's like in a action

cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin

Bustin, no need for discussion

{VERSE 1:(KURUPT)}

Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind

Thinkin many plots blossoms how amny times?

I'm sedated my (?conscriptiated?) from beginning

Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke

To my loccs way down in the Valley deep

To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach

To my bulls out in Philly coz all they smoke is phillies

Wit' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches

Now really really ever slip or trip

A big shout out to my niggas in ??

I spits the vocabulary to sinks MCs like ships

With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips

I gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts

The homies catchin cases,robberies and assaults

It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that

Listen in,get elevated off the verbal contact



{BRIGDE:(DAT NIGGA DAZ)}

When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop

Gotta get somewhere

When a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop

Gotta get somewhere



{VERSE 2:(DAZ,BAD AZZ,unknown)}

My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid

Hurt em in the worst way,put it down for myself

Put em to rest,confess nevertheless

Snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best

For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage

We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast

And the rest of the jungle,while mistreat

Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z

I represent it to the fullest,it could be a verbal massacre

In '96,with a diff'rent approach I'm shit

I got the flavour and I'm major,bust the ass

Niggas can't stop us and can't fade us

Shady ass niggas can't stand next to ya

When the Tek connects to ya,swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya

I bet'cha I won't let ya escape

Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area

When the smoke clears the area,rather we toast

So at home I blaze the zag or the bone

Once again another zone is gone

MCs try to step they get lit and blown



At the end the lights go out so before they do

I'm a L-B-C on through,stayin true

Demanding my respect,respect is what I've given

So respect is what I expect,the money got me driven

To the point of no return so the streets I roam

Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black

.45 calibre Glock,gat,gun or pistol

Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run

Or hear the click,damn that shit that you get hit with

When we bust I let loose,this is pre-meditated dick-up

To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it

With the every attempt they fail,oh well

Consequences get suffered,I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers

The bill is crisp,(the deal is )the deal is this-

I gotta plot em on a mash for my chips

Get in my way and get stepped on

I'm stompin,steppin with my projectile weapon



Wuz up (?Jex?)so's eject the hum

When I swarm through,who knew about the real deal I conceal?

But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust

No ho is a must!If I bust

My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max

Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs

We wax tracks and smack up MCs who compose the violence

Bringin drama with no parental guidance

Eyes went deceived,somethin up my sleeve to intrigue

And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs

When we do the do to you so go call your crew

And who wants to compete with technique

Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak

And what you say when I display

Sleepless acts as (?bombin ya?),suffer from insomnia

And I'm a gonna be comin for you

So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew

{1st Verse:}

Now if you tired of the hard work

tears and sweat

and you breakin' your neck

and you still up in debt.

Walkin' round town all strapped in,

niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did.

Two strikes none left, out of breath

Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo.

All this deception on top of stress,

you havin' more problems than a algebra test.

You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent,

and now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent.

It's a thin line, between yours and mine

the difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime.

Now I know a place where

Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there

Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind

You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.

{2nd Verse:}

Oh your homies think you're funny?

Doin' stick ups for moneys

Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)

Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,

you got two strikes, but you right back up to bat.

You all about yo' money and got something to sell

but if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell.

You chillin' wit yo' feet up

Someone hated but baby without the homies and

that's when you got beat up.

Because you can't be out there doin' low

and then right gather up yo' crew and roll.

Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt,

somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt.

But see, I know a place where

you might wanna be

and I can take you there

Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind

You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.

{Bridge One:}

Here ye, Here ye, come one, come all.

To a place that be, call it LBC.

Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick,

Cuz he travelin' in the fast lane.



Stop the life it seem that we are on,

Time to slow your roll,

Let Doggyland be your new home,

Stop the life it seem that we are on,

time to slow your roll,

Let Doggyland be your new home.



{Verse three:}

Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne

(It's goin' down)

Everything is free,

and ain't no HIV. (What?)

And niggas don't kill one another

(Oh really why is that?)

Because a brother is a brother.

(And what about the mothers?)

They queens,

righteous,

man,

heaven must be like this,

Ain't no peneteneries and ain't nobody doin' time.

And oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er,

Bigger than the mayor.

And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got

You gots to be and I took you there,

Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business,racketeerin
Smugglin,doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin

Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit

Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick

Different locations,spots where it takes place

If you show them my money,your ass is gettin f-laid

There's four major games that run the city of G's

The violators,the Gambinos and the Corleones and me

The violators and Gambinos they run uptown

Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown

Murder's an everyday thang in the city

Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its

Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons

Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected

So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot

Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block

Let em have it as soon as they come out

Unload on their ass,commence to takin them out!



{INTERLUDE:(DAZ talking)}

Throughout the streets of Long Beach

The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts

Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young

youth behaviour is outrageous with crime

They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements

have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs

from coming into our country, but they can't

The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount

of which they make is more than 700 million dollars

Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down

Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town

I been around since the Jumpstreet makin it pop

Young crook keepin hook,nigga,shakin the spot

Had to be a standout not to get ran out

Look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout

Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos

You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes

Trust,bust,be aware and I ain't ya curse

Cos the niggas that I dared to (?agank?) the first

Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling

As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin

I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life

Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes

Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listenin

And war story glory ain't worth the riskin

Real niggas still get a mob like respect

If you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck

Who I be?I'm the Dee,nigga check the file

Under G you will see not to sweat my style

I'm takin em out!



{INTERLUDE:(Corleone talking some more)}



{VERSE THREE:(SNOOP DOGG)}

I come through blastin,me as a Downtown Assassin

Mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets

Shoot em down in front of Hassans

Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?

In my zone,Don Corleone wanted

For the murder of forty men

Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again

From the U-S-C,I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides

Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months

Big business and big dollars is all that I want

I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make

Toast till we all die,till we burst and break

From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums

We ran outta dope,I don't think so son

While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park

From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark

From when I pick em off like darts

Stab em in they hearts

Make an example,what I said,ya end up dead

Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs

Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die

All I ever want is to be left alone

Me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome

Got paid by cops and judges,I budge when I buzz

I got the City of Long Beach goin crazy for drugs

Let these niggaz know that niggaz don't give a fuck!

This is just a small introduction to the G Funk Era

Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror

And I see motherfuckers tryin to be like me

Every since I put it down with the D-R-E



{Outro:}



Foamin at the mouth and waggin his tail

Searchin through the yards with a keen sense of smell

Lookin for the business in heat

And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat

We travel in packs and we do it from the back

How else can you get to the booty?

We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle

Yo motherfuckin hoes!!!

He fucked the fleas off a bitch

He shaked the ticks off his dick

And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin bone

And if there's any left over

He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home



Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin to a nigga

With so much drama in the L-B-C

It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G

Keep comin up with funky ass shit like every single day

May I, kick a little something for the G's (yeah)

I got bitches in the living room gettin it on

and, they ain't leavin til six in the mornin (six in the mornin)

So what you wanna do, sheeeit

So turn off the lights and close the doors

So we gonna smoke a ounce to this

G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this



{Chorus: repeat 2X}



Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice

Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)



{Verse Two:}



Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin

Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in

Now this types of shit, happens all the time

You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine

Everything is fine when you listenin to the D-O-G

I got the cultivating music that be captivating he

who listens, to the words that I speak

As I take me a drink to the middle of the street

and get to mackin to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)

She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)

Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please

Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these

At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze

{Verse Three:}



Later on that day

My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray

And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke

Shit, this ain't no joke

I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down

Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now

But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin

Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton

To serve me, not with a cherry on top

Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin up off the cot

Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes

I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'

And I'll be

Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself

Cuz it's cool when ya cause a cozy conditionin

Which we create, cuz that's our mission

So listen close, to what we say

Because this types of shit happens every-day

I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin

I gave myself a strech up, a mornin yawn and

went to the bathroom to wash up

I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup

and said um ""Mirror mirror, on, the wall

Who is the top Dogg of them all?""

There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted

The mirror said, ""You are you conceited bastard""

Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef

So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf

Used Oil of Olay, cuz my skin gets pale

And then I got the file, for my fingernails

I'm true to the style on my behalf

I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath

Clean, dry, was my body and hair

I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear

for all the bitches I might take home

I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne

Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks

Threw on my white sox, with my all blue chucks

Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no

I went back in, I forgot my indo

Then I dilly (dally) I ran through an (alley)

I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)

This was a girl playin hard to get

So I said ""What's wrong?"" cuz she looked upset

She said um



It's all because of you, i'm feelin said and blue

You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days

I love you so, how much you'll never know

Cause you took your dope away from me

A-huh, a-huh, ahuh



Damn, now what was I to do

She's cryin over me and she was feelin blue

I said, ""Um, don't cry, dry your eye

And here comes your mother with those two little guys""

Her mean mother steps then says to me ""Hi!!""

Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye

Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet

Slammed the child on the hard concrete

The bitch was strong, the kids was gone

Somethin was wrong I said, ""What was goin on?""

I tried to break up, I said, ""Stop it, just leave her!""

She said, ""If I can't smoke none, she can't either!""

She grabbed my closely by my socks

So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks

But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick

They started cryin on my shoes and grabbin my dick

and sayin....



Why don't you give me a play

So we can brake it down the Long Beach way

And if you give me that okay

I'll give you all my love today

Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see

Somehow your words just hypnotize me

And I just love your jazzy ways

Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay



And on and on and on she kept goin

The bitch been around before my mother's born!

I said, ""Cheer up!"" so I gave her a hit

I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!""

She said, ""No you're not,"" then she starts cryin

I says I'm nineteen, she says, ""Stop lyin!""

I says, ""I am, go ask my mother

And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover""

Yeah, uhh, tic toc you don't stop

And to the, ah tic toc and you don't quit

How long will I live?

""Eternal life and forever""

And will I be, the G that I was?

""I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of

Murder... murder was the case that they gave me



I'm fresh up out my coma

I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner

It's gonna take a miracle they say

For me to walk again and talk again but anyway

I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet

And everything that nigga said, came to reality

Livin like a baller loc

Havin money, and blowin hella chronic smoke

I bought my momma a Benz, and bought my Boo-Boo a Jag

And now I'm rollin in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad

I pray the lord, my soul to keep

If I should die, before I wake

I pray the lord, my soul to take



No more indo, gin and juice

I'm on my way to Chino, rollin on the grey goose

Shackled from head to toe

Cuz it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C

Mad doggin niggaz cuz I don't care

Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair

Niggaz stare as I enter the center

They send me to a leval 3 yard, that's where I stay

Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor

Niggaz gettin they shanks, just in case the war, pops off

Cuz you can't tell what's next

My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck

And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two

I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Who am I? (It's Kurupt motherfucker)
Do or die (We gives a fuck motherfucker)

So slow your roll, I'm In Control like Janet

The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet

Take it for granted, if ya wanna, cuz I'm gonna

Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air

Now on a one, two, three who could it be

Comin with a group of gangsta shit for ninety-three

So ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up

And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up

Now can't nobody see me here or there

wherever I bails, I put it down on the ground

Cuz ain't shit for sale in the Coupe

with the beat flossin off gold D's

And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean

And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap

in your ass, for gettin us all fucked up

Now check it, it's a callin for niggaz like Doggs

who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin like hogs

(Yes y'all) Walk the Doggs (yes y'all) Yiggy y'all

Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball



I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this

Now how many bitches must get dick?

Before they say, that Daz is that nigga from back in the day

Ya never ever thought I'd see him bustin with Dr. Dre

Cuz I grips mics, I rips mics in half

Hoes be comin to my flat so I can tap that ass

{Verse Three: Kurupt}



You're headed my way, nigga you best to hit a U-turn quick

So what's happenin? I'm cappin shit up like a Western flick

17 shot Glock cocked, so all nigga drop

The run of the mill fool get broke off for tryin to serve

I smoke chronic everyday, so what have we

Another motherfucker, gettin served like some cavy

Now who, drops (ruff rhymes) I got full Juice like 2Pac

Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt

Hellraisin like Pinhead, beware I'm tearin shit the fuck up

Slow your roll, like your legs was broken

Who's jokin? Rakim never joked, so why should I loc?

Now that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe

Runnin em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row

Mediocre motherfuckers die cuz I'm servin it

They can't fuck with or see me I'm mass murderin

Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techiques

Take down, when it comes to the mic I'm puttin my weight down

And that's 175 pounds of beed

And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, cuz we gonna make it a little mystery
here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick



{Verse One: Nate Dogg}



When I met you last night baby

Before you opened up your gap

I had respect for ya lady

But now I take it all back

Cause you gave me all your pussy

And ya even licked my balls

Leave your number on the cabinet

And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call

Next time I'm feelin kinda horny

You can come on over, and I'll break you off

And if you can't fuck, that day, baby

Just lay back, and open your mouth

Cause I have never

met a girl

That I love

in the whole wide world



{Verse Two: Kurupt}



Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke

I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke

I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me

Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?

I have no love for hoes

That's somethin I learned in the pound

so how the fuck am I supposed

to pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe

I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times

And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it

Pass it to the homie, now you hit it

Cause she ain't nuthin but a bitch to me

And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me

i gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention

Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt

Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none



{Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg}



Guess who back in the motherfuckin house

With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth

Hoes recognize, niggaz do too

Cuz when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo

What you gon do? You really don't know

So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe

Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch

Knowin damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip

Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger

How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop

Doggy, I'm all the above

I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes

But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it

Cause you know I don't love em



{Verse Four: Warren G}



Whoa!

Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow

One for the money, two for the btiches

Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches

In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact

With bitches on my side, and bitches on back

So back up bitch cuz i'm strugglin, so get

off your knees and then start jugglin

these motherfuckin nuts in your mouth

It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

Whoo!

A fuckin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets

All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin

I wanna see some panties droppin

I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton

(All I ever did was just use that hoe

Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)

I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news

Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes

Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs

and I smoke weed for the fuck of it

Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked

but it's manditory that I kick it

Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it

Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin

Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin

Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn

Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin

Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action

You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog

You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog

Tell when (till the early morn)

It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)

The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)



Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin cut once mo'

So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow

I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick

Till I die I'm still screamin that (bitches ain't shit)

Now i'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about

the city where I'm from, dum diddy dum

As you groove to the gangster shit

The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique

We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row

Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it

Still clockin grip, and really don't give a sheeit

about nuttin at all, just my Doggs, steppin through the fog

and i'm still gonna fade em all

With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin

How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin?

Every single one, to get the job done

East Side, Long Beach, in a 7-8 Coupe DeBille

So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set

A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit

With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin dick

And the Compton niggaz all about to set trip

Swing it back, bring it back, just like this

And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff

And keep the motherfuckin blunt in your pocket loc

Cuz Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke

See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from

And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some

But watch the gun by my side

Because it represents me and the motherfuckin East Side

So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow

yippie yo, you can't see my flow

My shit is dope, original, now you know

And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow
