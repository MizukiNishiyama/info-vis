And they're taking it easy, swapping personal experiences
Let's listen in America Today
Life of the party, mhm, 'til I almost cry, mhm
It's the life of the party, to think I could've almost died
Lord, help us



Hey, Miss Donda

You run into my mama, please tell her I said, ""Say something""

I'm startin' to believe ain't no such thing as Heaven's trumpets

No after-over, this is it, done

If there's a Heaven, you would think they'd let ya speak to your son

Maybe she has in the form of a baby's laugh

I heard passing by in a stroller remindin' me, ""Hey, keep rolling""

I don't know, maybe she has with a prick of a blade of grass

I've been layin' on way too long, got me itchy

Got up and roamed a lil' more

Miss Donda, you see my mama, tell her I'm lost

You see, she'd always light a cigarette, we talk, I would cough

Exaggeratin' a lil' bit so she get the point

Tryna get her to stop smokin', I would leave and fire up a joint

'Til I quit, started back up again, twenty years later

All that time, y'all thought a nigga was high, thought I was crazy

My mom, she ain't cut no corners

Got me back on track, I don't miss her overstepping

But do miss her showin' Seven civilian life ****

Ah, Miss Donda, you see my mama, whisper her this:

The real reason I was geeked to go to church

Must confess, when y'all grown-ups would be in Bible study

That girl helping me with my homework? Her and I were ****

So pure and ****, so spirit spinning and dirty

So on, so on, and so on, we hoped that no one heard us

Sh-sh, ah, ah

And to this day, I think her mama knew but let us explore

Miss Donda, you see my father, please, ask him why he never married

Always smiled, but was he happy inside?

Because I carried my mother's name, did he carry shame with him?

I'm sure she did it out of spite, it was her decision at birth

Shit, she probably was hurt, ah, poor baby

Two young people with different views, a lot for a young lady

No coincidence, they both passed away from heart conditions

There's a dissidence at play, dad and mom do hard division

Three Thou', poster child for big **** **** raised by their mothers

I'm supposed to smile as if God knew that I would be troubled

Keeps me around, for what? I don't know

But I do know that it's crucial, that we do so, pronto

I don't know how much long though



Straight from Shibuya, on some zen

We back, ramped up, we on ten

It's a marathon and look, we comin' for the win

Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (C'mon)

Put the whole family on, look at what my Kim did

Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (Uh)

We gon' win big (What?)



Southside gang mentality way heavy

I was thinkin' out the box even in a Box Chevy

And my favorite art teacher name was Mrs. Levy

'Round the time, I learned to put my feelings to a medley (The life of the party)

I ain’t turn in homework for like four months and I bet she let me

She saw the vision

""Yeezy you special, go make your own decisions then""

Man, that was a good choice, faith driving us like a Rolls Royce

They tried to take my voice away, I ain't try to take ya choice away

I just prayed the water break, just for my daughter sake, from a slip-up

Fake signatures from fake managers, it all damage ya, good Lord

Give 'em enough of they own rope to hang 'em with

The paparazzi never really got what my angle is

They treat my married life like some type of entanglement

My neighbor still dissin', wonderin' why I ain't sayin' it

I can smell the setup, that's that 2Pac in Vegas hit

I revealed myself and some don't know what to make of it

God has said himself to make sure that the baby live

And if Ye ain't here, then tell me who gonna say this here?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a goddamn minute

Let me stop playing with it, hopped in a Lamb' with it

Hopped in a Lamb' with it, in a damn pandemic

Know that Uncle Sam gotta have his damn hand in it



Listen, straight from Shibuya, on some zen

I'm on ten, it's a marathon and look, we comin' for the win

Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (C'mon)

Put the whole family on, look at what my Kim did

Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (Uh)

We gon' win big (What?)



Do y'all feel me? Really?

Get off Scott Free, I'm talking Ridley

Get off our knees, that's if you're with me

Get off your knees, that's if you're with me

Get off your knees and let's get free

Get off your knees and let's get free

Really, I mean really

Really, I mean really

I need release, I don't need police

I'm like, ""****, puh-lease""

Y'all can't hear me, (Harmonizing), for the real me

For the real me, I mean, mhmm-mm



Alright, it's gonna shoot us in the— woah, uh-oh, uh-oh

Ready mama? (Yup)

I'm so proud of you, yup, you're gonna have so much fun

They gonna shoot us in the air, mama, okay?

C'mon, P, I got you, it's okay, mama

Hold your head back, hold your head back (Three, two, one)

Daddy's here, daddy's here, daddy's right here

It's okay, mama, daddy's here, daddy here

Help, help, daddy's right here, I'm scared

Okay, okay, I got you, it's okay

Okay, we goin' slow, we goin' slow down

It's okay, stop cryin', daddy got you, see, it's over, you did it, P!

You already did it! See? It's already over! Yay! You did it!

Big Girl! It's already over! It's already over, it's already over (The life of the party)

Daddy right here, daddy right here ('Til I almost cried)

I told you I'm not gon' let you go

I'm not gon' let you go, mama, okay?

Daddy got you, daddy gon' bring us all the way down, okay?

How was it? (We good)

You did a good job (It was scary)

Good job! (Our daughter got more heart than you)"

Did what I want, and I say what I want

And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?

I got this God power, that's my leverage

I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages

I gotta help myself out of selfishness

I just bought a floor out of Selfridges

I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with

I gotta tell 'em sorry, they too delicate

I gotta stay with God where the blessings is

Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy

I talk to God everyday, that's my bestie

They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi

And this money could never neglect me

I pray that my family they never resent me

And she fell in love with me as soon she met me

Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave

I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe

You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived

By some dude who's more rather into greed

Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs

Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha

You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?

But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved

Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed

Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha

I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no

My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)

How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?

How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?

Quiet all the cordialness

'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)

You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)

'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here

Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here

But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)

And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)

I deaded those night terrors when the night clears

And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?

And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)

But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)

You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic

Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic

And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)

And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)

And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid

That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it

Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)

But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)

Baby shower time, father didn't show up

Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up

The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)

A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)

And she's still dependent on her mom

Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun

He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)

And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)

Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?

From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)

A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)

Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side

He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes

To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)

Even let him get the last meal

He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)

He gotta show him that it's that real

He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)

""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)

""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""

He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""

Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)



Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)



Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)

Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)

Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)

To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)

It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor

Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)

I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)

But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda

Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)

What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)

In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)

I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal

The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local

My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)

As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)

I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel

My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne

But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castille (Jesus)

I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)

My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears

Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier

It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)

It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)



Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Now we've been through a lot of things

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

He lives in a lot of things

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Been through a lot of things

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)



What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr

First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office

You might not have been the only one that could've did that

But you were the one that did do that

And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight

You know, to me, it kinda feels like

Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids

Have all been incarcerated through this journey

And we haven't even been to jail

We have been looked at and treated as criminals

For being a part of this family

My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in

Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)

'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him

And it is what made the children of today

After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one

My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world

And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples

If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction

Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years

Man, he would be dead to me

I didn't sign up for that

I didn't stay on this journey this long for that

All my life, man

I've been waitin' for my father to come home

They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home

Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home

I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home

Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated

He still not home

Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'

Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren

And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather

Even though it is not seen that way for some of us

But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community

Who deserves to breathe free air

Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)"

One last sparkle to follow in love

One last sparkle to follow in my light

One last sparkle to follow



Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave

I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe

You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived

By some dude who's more rather into greed

Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs

Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha

You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?

But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved

Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed

Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha

I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no

My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)



Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down

Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'

About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'

Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)

I watched so many people leave (Lord)

I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sеasonin'

God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in

I know I madе a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)

But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)

And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end

It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there

You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)

Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)

And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there

Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions

And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)

Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)

Mama, you was the life of the party

I swear you brought life to the party

When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)

That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)

Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me

Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army

'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)

You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)

'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here

Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here

But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)

And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)

I deaded those night terrors when the night clears

And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?

And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)

But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)

You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic

Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic

And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)

And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)

And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid

That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it

Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)

But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)

Baby shower time, father didn't show up

Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up

The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)

A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)

And she's still dependent on her mom

Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun

He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)

And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)

Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?

From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)

A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)

Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side

He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes

To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)

Even let him get the last meal

He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)

He gotta show him that it's that real

He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)

""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)

""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""

He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""

Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)



Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)



Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)

Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)

Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)

To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)

It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor

Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)

I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)

But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda

Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)

What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)

In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)

I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal

The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local

My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)

As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)

I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel

My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne

But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castille (Jesus)

I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)

My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears

Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier

It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)

It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)



Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Now we've been through a lot of things

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

He lives in a lot of things

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Been through a lot of things

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)



What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr

First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office

You might not have been the only one that could've did that

But you were the one that did do that

And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight

You know, to me, it kinda feels like

Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids

Have all been incarcerated through this journey

And we haven't even been to jail

We have been looked at and treated as criminals

For being a part of this family

My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in

Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)

'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him

And it is what made the children of today

After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one

My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world

And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples

If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction

Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years

Man, he would be dead to me

I didn't sign up for that

I didn't stay on this journey this long for that

All my life, man

I've been waitin' for my father to come home

They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home

Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home

I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home

Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated

He still not home

Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'

Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren

And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather

Even though it is not seen that way for some of us

But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community

Who deserves to breathe free air

Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)"

Mad when she home

Sad when she gone

Mad when she home

Sad when she gone (Loosen right now, the spirit that wants to run)

Floatin' on a silver lining (In the name of Jesus)

Yeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining

And my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, ""Get behind me""

And all the stars are aligned, lift me up every time

You know exactly where to find me



Hallelujah (Thank you, Jesus)

Hallelujah (Yes)

Hallelujah



Did those ideas ever really come to life?

Make it all come to life

Make it all come to life

Prayin' for a change in your life

Well, maybe it's gon' come tonight



Sadness settin' in again

Three, two, one, you're pinned

Uncle right back in the pen'

Tell me how auntie been

Took your thoughts and penciled 'em in

Should've wrote 'em down in pen

And maybe they'll come to life

And maybe they'll come to life

Sadness settin' in again

Three, two, one, you're pinned

Uncle right back to the pen'

Tell me how auntie been

Thoughts, you had penciled 'em in

Probably should've wrote 'em in pen

And maybe they'll come to life

They could finally come to life

They could finally come to life



You know where to find me, they cannot define me

So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?

Come and purify me, come and sanctify me

You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam

Brought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes

This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free

But, we're made up of 90 percent water

We are water (We are water)

But, we'll get through it because of your love

Either way, we crash like water

I know I won't forget all He's done

He's the strength in this race that I run

Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness

And it shows just how much He is miraculous

I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still

Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed

King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store

From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door

You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name

Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane

And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up

I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup

I know God is alive, yeah

He has opened up my vision

Giving me a revelation

This ain't 'bout a damn religion

Jesus brought a revolution

All the captives are forgiven

Time to break down all the prisons

Every man, every woman

There is freedom from addiction

Jesus, You have my soul

Sunday Service on a roll

All my idols, let 'em go

All the demons, let 'em know

This a mission, not a show

This is my eternal soul

This my kids, this the crib

This my wife, this my life

This my God-given right

Thank you, Jesus, won the fight



That's what God is

That's what God is

I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you

I contemplated, premeditated murder

And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so...

Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder

You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love

The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest

(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)

Just say it out loud to see how it feels

People say ""don't say this, don't say that""

Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels

Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table

Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder

I think about killing myself, and I, I love myself way more than I love you

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest

(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)

I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad

But sometimes I think really bad things

Really, really, really bad things

And I love myself way more than I love you

See, if I was trying to relate it to more people

I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself because that seems like a common theme

But that's not the case here

I love myself way more than I love you

And I think about killing myself

So, best believe, I thought about killing you today

Premeditated murder



I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins

I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb

Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none

Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb

Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pu-pu-pum

Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em

I need coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue

I don't joke with no one, they'll say he die so young

I done had a bad case of too many bad days

Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays

I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache

I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name

It's a different type of rules that we obey

Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay

We was all born to die, nigga DOA

Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cape

Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah, I don't see no, mhm, mhm

If I wasn't shining so hard, wouldn't be no shade

Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay

Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age

I thought I was past my Deebo ways

Even when I went broke, I ain't break

How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back

To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap

Drop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP

Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that

Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed

They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)

All you gotta do is speak on Ye

All you gotta do is speak on Ye

I'm the only one that's in control

I been feeling all I'm giving

For my children

I will die for those I love

God I'm willing

To make this my mission

Give up the women

Before I lose half of what I own

I been thinking

About my vision

Pour out my feelings

Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul

The layers to my soul

Revealing the layers to my soul



Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up

Can't let them get to me

And even though I always fuck my life up

Only I can mention me



See before I let you go, one last thing I need to let you know

You ain't never seen nothing crazier than

This nigga when he off his Lexapro

Remember that last time in Mexico

Remember that like time the episode

Asking me why the hell I text in code

Four times that you say don't text me hoe

Told you four times don't test me hoe

Now we finna lose all self control

But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me

Especially when we in the Giuseppe store

But I'mma have the last laugh in the end

Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe

But I'mma have the laugh in the end

Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe

And I...



Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up

Can't let them get to me

And even though I always fuck my life up

Only I can mention me

Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up

Can't let them get to me

And even though I always fuck my life up

Only I can mention me



Do you feel the hand

On a level above the hands

Throw them, throw them away

Don't stop your loving

Don't stop for nothing

No, no don't stop it

They always wanna

They don't wanna see me love you

They don't wanna see me love you

They don't wanna see me love you

They don't wanna see me love you

On a level above the hands

Throw them, throw them away

It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle

I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing

Hope you're doin' your thing too

I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions

F*ck the church up, I'm drinkin' at the communion

Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined

In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?

Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom

I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you're not the problem

Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday

Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?

When was the last time I remembered a birthday?

When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?



Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime

Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime

Even when we was young I used to make time

Now we be way too busy just to make time

Even for my...



Real friends

I guess I get what I deserved on 'em

Word in the streets is they ain't heard from him

I guess I get what I deserved on 'em

Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him



I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was

Couldn't tell you how old your son is

I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg

Plus I already got one kid

Couldn't tell you much about the fam though

I just showed up for the yams though

Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister

Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business

You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?

Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with

Please don't pressure me with that bill shit

Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children

Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me

Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me

It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries

To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy

Money turn your kin into an enemy

Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be



Lookin' for all my real friends

How many of us? How many of us are real friends

To real friends, to the real end

'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin

To 3 A.M., callin'

How many real friends?

Just to ask you a question

Just to see how you was feelin'

How many?

For the last you was frontin'

I hate when a nigga text you like, ""what's up, fam, oh you good?""

You say, ""I'm good"" then great, next day they ask you for somethin'

How many?

What's best for your family, immediate or extended

Any argument, the media'll extend it

I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on

Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him

Real friends

Huh?

Hell you know my repertoire is like a wrestler

I show you the ropes, connect the dots

A country girl that love Hollywood

Mama used to cook red beans and rice

Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite

Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection

Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians

R&B singers and lesions, rappers and managers

Music and not phone cameras

Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is

The hair still good though, the hair still good though

Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical, make me get spiritual

Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Captain Crunch cereal

Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me

Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday

Bottle service, head service, I came in first place

The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek

The pop community, I mean these bitches come with uni fee

And I walk through with ease, moving units through consumer streets

And like my wife said, I still didn't say no

People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter

My friends' best advice was to stay low

I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills

He sat back and smiled

Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime

The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality

Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?

I am one with the people

I am one with the people (Real!)

I've been woken from enlightened man's dream

Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem

Let me not say too much or do too much

'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch

I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen

I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov

I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove

But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks

'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke

Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go

We all go

What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?

What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?

Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

No church in the wild

No church in the wild

I invented swag

Where the hell ya been?

Niggas talkin real reckless: stuntmen

They aint see me cause I pulled up in my other Benz

Last week I was in my other other Benz

Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another gain



Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth

I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself

Uh, live from the Mercer

Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya

Flee in the G450 I might surface

Political refugee, asylum can be purchased

Uh, everythings for sale, I got 5 passports

I'm never going to jail



I made Jesus Walks I'm never going to hell

Couture level flow, it's never going on sale

Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses

Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive

I get it custom, you a customer

You ain't customed to going through Customs, you ain't been nowhere, huh?

And all the ladies in the house, got em showing off

I'm done, I hit ya up mana-naaaa!



Welcome to Havana

Smoking cubanos with Castro in cabanas

Viva Mexico, Cubano

Dominicano, all the plugs that I know

Driving Benzes, wit' no benefits

Not bad huh? For some immigrants

Build your fences, we diggin' tunnels

Can't you see? We gettin' money up under you



Can't you see the private jets flyin' over you?

Maybach bumper sticker read What would Hova do?

Jay is chillin', Ye is chillin'

Hold up, before we end this campaign

Yeah, me and the RZA connect
And I’ll never let my son have an ego
He’ll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican

So everybody know he love white people

And I’ll never let him leave his college girlfriend

And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind

And I’ll never let him ever hit the telethon

I mean even if people dyin’ and the world ends

See, I just want him to have an easy life

Not like Yeezy life, just want him to be someone people like

Don’t want him to be hated all the time, judged

Don’t be like your daddy that would never budge

And I’ll never let him ever hit a strip club

I learned the hard way, that ain’t the place to get love

And I’ll never let his mom move to LA

Knowin’ she couldn’t take the pressure now we all pray



Me and the RZA connect

Sorry junior, I already ruined ya

Cause you ain’t even alive, paparazzi pursuin’ ya

Sins of a father make your life ten times harder

I just wanna take ya to a barber

Bondin’ on charters, all the shit that I never did

Teach ya good values so you cherish it

Took me 26 years just to find my path

My only job is cut the time in half

So at 13 we’ll have our first drink together

Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk

Look a man dead in his eyes so he know you talk truth

When you speak it, give your word, keep it

And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend

I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him

Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin’

Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him

Never repeat him, never repeat him"

It aint safe in the city, watch the throne

You say I care more about them basquion's, basquiats

She learning a new word, its yacht

Blew the World up as soon as I hit the club with her

Too Short called, told me ""I fell in love with her""

Seen by actors, ball players and drug dealers

And some lesbians that never loved niggas

Twisted love story True Romance

Mary Magdalene from a pole dance

I'm a freak huh, rock star life

The second girl with us, thats our wife

Hey boys and girls, I got a new riddle

Who's the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle

No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle

But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle

Not swerving, oh, yeah

Swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion

Stop motion, ooh, yeah

Go harder than a nigga for a nigga go figure

Told me ""keep my own money"" if we ever did split up

How can somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures?

With jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers

Uh, Picasso was alive he woulda made her

Thats right nigga Mona Lisa can't fade her

I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice

But why all the pretty icons always all white

Back to my Beyonces

You deserve 3 stacks for the Andre

Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in museums

You belong in Vintage clothes watching the whole building

You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing

You too dope for any of those civilians

Now shoot trigga, stop looking at her tits

Get ya own dog, ya heard

She turned around and looked at me and said ""alive""

Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well



[Jay-Z:]

Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes

Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov

Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears

Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs

My uncle died, My Daddy did too

Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move

My nephew gone, My heart is torn

Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born

My faith in God, Every day is hard

Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard



[Kanye West:]

Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God

Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all

So que sera, Get a case of Syrah

Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far



[Jay-Z:]

My dreams is big, Reality set in

Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,

Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas

Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it

I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise

Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5

I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin

I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending

Where the fuck is the sun?

It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son

What happened to my smile?

My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket

I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it

Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low

God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?

I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment

I look in the mirror, My only opponent

Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?

Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed

No crying in public, Just lying to judges

Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well

[Jay-Z:]

This is to the memory of Danroy Henry

Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly

Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team

Giving you respect, I expect the same thing

All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code

I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load

Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be

Power to the people, When you see me, see you



[Kanye West:]

And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital

Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon

Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,

No shop class but half the school got a tool,

And I could die any day type attitude

Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue

It's time for us to stop and re-define black power

41 souls murdered in 50 hours



The paper read murder, Black on black murder,

The paper read murder, Black on black murder again

Murder again...



Is it genocide?

Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized

Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size

The old pastor closed the cold casket

And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs

It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from

I feel the pain in my city wherever I go

314 soldiers died in Iraq

509 died in Chicago



[Jay-Z:]

I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died

Real niggas just multiply

And they say 21 I was supposed to die

So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise

If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival

You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you

What up blood? What up cause?

It's all black, I love us



[Kanye West:]

The paper read murder, Black on black murder again



[Jay-Z:]

It's a celebration of black excellence

Black tie, black Maybachs

Black excellence, opulence, decadence

Tuxes next to the president, I'm present

I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris

In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb

Do you know who I am Clarice?

No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""

Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success

The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast

I repeat, My religion is the beat

My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino

Only spot a few blacks the higher I go

What's up to Will, Shoutout to O

That ain't enough, We gon need a million more

Kick in the door, Biggie flow

I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go



[Kanye West:]

Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go

So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P

From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys

We like the promised land of the OG's

In the past if you picture events like a black tie

What the last thing you expect to see, black guys

What's the life expectancy for black guys?

The system's working effectively, that's why

I'll be a real man and take care of your son

Every problem you had before this day is now done

New crib, watch a movie

Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues

Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci

Now ain't nothin new but your shoes

Sunday morning, Praise the Lord

You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for

So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor

Black excellence, Truly yours"

I'm trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man's

Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this water

The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order

Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up YaYa?

What's that smell? Oh I'm just boiling some aqua

No papa, bad Santa

I got my liberty, chopping grams up

But why I love you

Picture if you will, that the throne was burning

Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning

Why does it always end up like this?

Something that we don't determine

Same people that I fought for

That I fight for, that I ride for

That I live for, that I die for

Be the reason that these niggas is alive for

And they want me dead

But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you

But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you

We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th

Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?

When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over

I tried to teach niggas how to be kings

And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers

So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn

So we no longer wear the same uniform

Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller

The castle got bigger, The walls got taller

And truth be told after all that said

Niggas still got love for you



[Chorus: Mr Hudson]

I love you so

But why I love you

I'll never know [x4]



[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]

Showed love to you niggas

You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it

I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it

God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it

Shit feelin' like death don't it

Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it

I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it

Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it

But first I shall digress on it

Wasn't I a good king?

(Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)

Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?

(Huh, I gave you my loyalty)

Made you Royalty and royalties

(Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)

And this is how niggas rewardin me

(Damn)

I love you so

But why I love you

I'll never know [x4]



[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]

Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me

But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me

Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)

And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?

(Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)

Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist

So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit

Am I my brother's keeper?

(Only if that nigga don't creep up)

Got a pistol under my pillow

(I've never been a deep sleeper)

P-p-p-paranoia

(Cause the nigga that said he'll...)

Blast for ya (Is now...)

Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya

Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us

Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake

She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake

Now there's crumbs all over the damn place

And she want me to cum all over her damn face

I never understood planned parenthood

Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood

Taking refills of that plan B pill

Another shorty that won't make it to the family will

If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will

They ain't crazy they don't know how insanity feel

Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad

But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they sisters

They momma, named them after white bitches

So next time you see me on your fallopian

Though the Jewelry's Egytian, know the hunger's Ethiopian

Stupid questions like ""Is he gon be dope again?

Have You seen him? has anybody spoke to him? ""

This beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch and a bag of weed the Holy Trinity

In the mirror where I see my only enemy,

Your life's cursed, well mine's an obscenity



[Chorus]



[Jay-Z:]

This is my momma shit

I used to hear this through the walls in the hood when I was back in my pyjama shit

Afro's and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja hat will be popping like the sample that I'm rhyming with

Pete Rock, let the needle drop

I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don't needle pop

Taking sips of pop, six packs of millanips

Pink champel, Valentine L

Bally's on my feet help me balance out well

That and the shit I used to balance on the scale

I got it honest from the parties from my momma's

Virgin Mary's try to judge her, I'm like ""where the Madonna's now? ""

Give all glory to Gloria, they said ""you raised that boy too fast, but you was raising a warrior""

We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us



[Kid Cudi:]

Keep you hands up, get mine up

Don't let them take your fire

Keep you hands up, get mine up

Don't let them take your fire

Keep you hands up, get mine up

Don't let them take your fire

Keep you hands up, get mine up

Yeaaaah, okay



It's Pete Rock, Kanye, One, two, okay

It's Pete Rock, Kanye, One, two, okay

It's Pete Rock, Kanye, One, two, okay

Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor

Blood stains the Colosseum doors

Lies on the lips of a priest

Thanksgiving disguised as a feast

Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche

Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police

Cocaine seats

All white like I got the whole thing bleached

Drug dealer chic

I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach

Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?

Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?

All for Plato, screech

I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks

Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats

Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats

What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?

Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild



I live by you, desire

I stand by you, walk through the fire

Your love is my scripture

Let me into your encryption



Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra

I call that jungle fever

You will not control the threesome

Just roll the weed up until I get me some

We formed a new religion

No sins as long as there's permission

And deception is the only felony

So never fuck nobody without telling me

Sunglasses and Advil

Last night was mad real

Sun coming up, 5 a.m

I wonder if they got cabs still

Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard

Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard

Two tattoos: one read ""No Apologies""

The other said ""Love is Cursed by Monogamy""

It's something that the pastor don't preach

It's something that a teacher can't teach

When we die, the money we can't keep

But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap

Preach



Human beings in a mob

What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?

What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?

And I’ll never let him leave his college girlfriend

And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind

And I’ll never let him ever hit the telethon

I mean even if people dyin’ and the world ends

See, I just want him to have an easy life

Not like Yeezy life, just want him to be someone people like

Don’t want him to be hated all the time, judged

Don’t be like your daddy that would never budge

And I’ll never let him ever hit a strip club

I learned the hard way, that ain’t the place to get love

And I’ll never let his mom move to LA

Knowin’ she couldn’t take the pressure now we all pray

Cause you ain’t even alive, paparazzi pursuin’ ya

Bondin’ on charters, all the shit that I never did

Teach ya good values so you cherish it

Took me 26 years just to find my path

My only job is cut the time in half

So at 13 we’ll have our first drink together

Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk

Look a man dead in his eyes so he know you talk truth

When you speak it, give your word, keep it

And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend

I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him

Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin’

Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov

Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears

Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs

My uncle died, My Daddy did too

Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move

My nephew gone, My heart is torn

Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born

My faith in God, Every day is hard

Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard

Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God

Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all

So que sera, Get a case of Syrah

Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far

My dreams is big, Reality set in

Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,

Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas

Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it

I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise

Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5

I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin

I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending

Where the fuck is the sun?

It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son

What happened to my smile?

My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket

I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it

Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low

God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?

I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment

I look in the mirror, My only opponent

Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?

No crying in public, Just lying to judges

Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well

Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly

Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team

Giving you respect, I expect the same thing

All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code

I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load

Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be

Power to the people, When you see me, see you



[Kanye West:]

And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital

Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon

Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,

No shop class but half the school got a tool,

And I could die any day type attitude

Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue

It's time for us to stop and re-define black power

41 souls murdered in 50 hours



The paper read murder, Black on black murder,

The paper read murder, Black on black murder again

Murder again...



Is it genocide?

Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized

Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size

The old pastor closed the cold casket

And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs

It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from

I feel the pain in my city wherever I go

314 soldiers died in Iraq

509 died in Chicago



[Jay-Z:]

I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died

Real niggas just multiply

And they say 21 I was supposed to die

So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise

If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival

You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you

What up blood? What up cause?

It's all black, I love us

It's a celebration of black excellence

Black tie, black Maybachs

Black excellence, opulence, decadence

Tuxes next to the president, I'm present

I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris

In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb

Do you know who I am Clarice?

No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""

Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success

The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast

I repeat, My religion is the beat

My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino

Only spot a few blacks the higher I go

What's up to Will, Shoutout to O

That ain't enough, We gon need a million more

Kick in the door, Biggie flow

I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go



[Kanye West:]

Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go

So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P

From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys

We like the promised land of the OG's

In the past if you picture events like a black tie

What the last thing you expect to see, black guys

What's the life expectancy for black guys?

The system's working effectively, that's why

I'll be a real man and take care of your son

Every problem you had before this day is now done

New crib, watch a movie

Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues

Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci

Now ain't nothin new but your shoes

Sunday morning, Praise the Lord

You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for

So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor

Black excellence, Truly yours"

Picture if you will, that the throne was burning

Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning

Why does it always end up like this?

Something that we don't determine

Same people that I fought for

That I fight for, that I ride for

That I live for, that I die for

Be the reason that these niggas is alive for

And they want me dead

But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you

But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you

We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th

Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?

When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over

I tried to teach niggas how to be kings

And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers

So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn

So we no longer wear the same uniform

Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller

The castle got bigger, The walls got taller

And truth be told after all that said

Niggas still got love for you

You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it

God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it

Shit feelin' like death don't it

Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it

I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it

Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it

But first I shall digress on it

Wasn't I a good king?

(Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)

Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?

(Huh, I gave you my loyalty)

Made you Royalty and royalties

But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me

Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)

And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?

(Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)

Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist

So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit

Am I my brother's keeper?

(Only if that nigga don't creep up)

Got a pistol under my pillow

(I've never been a deep sleeper)

P-p-p-paranoia

(Cause the nigga that said he'll...)

Blast for ya (Is now...)

Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya

(These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)

Please lord (Forgive him)

For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)"

You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring

Twisted fictions, sick addictions

Well, gather round children, zip it, listen:



Can we get much higher? So high

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh



I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago

Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago

That's me, the first year that I blow

How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo

Me drown sorrow in that Diablo

Me found bravery in my bravado

DJs need to listen to the models

""You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?""

(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)

Stupid, but what the hell do I know?

I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow

And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo

So much head, I woke up in Sleepy Hollow



Can we get much higher?

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh



Look like a fat booty Celine Dion

Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis

Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher

Tell me how do you respond to students?

And refresh the page and restart the memory?

Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?

We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies

Sorry for the night demons still visit me

The plan was to drink until the pain over

But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?

Fresh air, rollin' down the window

Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low

Don't make me pull the toys out, huh

Don't make me pull the toys

And fire up the engines, huh

And then they make noise



Can we get much higher? So high

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh



At the mall, there was a seance

Just kids, no parents

Then the sky filled with herons

(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron

And the hell, it wouldn't spare us

And the fires did declare us

But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress

And woke up back in Paris



Can we get much higher? So high

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh"

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying

I will never ever let you live this down, down, down



Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it

I can feel it slowly dripping away from me

No more chances if you blow this, you bogus

I will never ever let you live this down, down, down



[Kanye West - Verse 1]

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances

and eventually answers to the call of Autumn

all of them fallin' for the love of ballin'

got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin

inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums

based off the way we was branded

face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon

and at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random

but we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage

I need a happy ending and a new beginning

and a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative



This the real world, homie, school finished

they done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it

I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS

I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?



[Kid Cudi]

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it

I can feel it slowly drifting away from me

I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying

I will never ever let you live this down, down, down



[Kanye West - Verse 2]

Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion

the soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing

this is more than just my road to redemption

Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention

as long as I'm in Polo's they think they got me

but they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me



I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me

if a nigga aint running shootin a jump shot running a track meet

but this pimp is, ar the top of mount Olympus

ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics

we make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish

choke a southpark writer with a fishstick

I insisted to get up offa this dick

and these drugs, fans cant resist it

remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted

if I ever one of the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!



[Kid Cudi]

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it

I can feel it slowly drifting away from me

I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying

I will never ever let you live this down, down, down



[Kanye West - Verse 3]

I need more drinks and less lights

and that American Apparal girl in just tights

she told the director she tryna get in a school

he said ""take them glasses off and get in the pool""

it's been a while since I watched the tube

cause like a crip said: ""I got way too many blues for any more bad news""

I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today

they rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday

and what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach

I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach

but God said I need a different approach

cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke

it aint funny anymore try dipping jokes

tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o

kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it

play strings for the dramatic

and end all of that wack shit

act like I aint had a belt in two classes

I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it

I'm coming after whoever who has it

you blowing up, that's good, fantastic

that y'all, its like that ya'll

I don't really give a fuck about it at all

cause the same people that tried to black ball me

forgot about 2 things, my black balls



[Kid Cudi - Chorus]



[Raekwon]

I know cops, hems is lifting lenses

kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes

counting up, smoking, one cuff

live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it

steam about a hundred and one L's

kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson

nigga hat game was special

it matched every black pair of Nikes

throwing dice for decimals

the older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head

make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead

got made code red

break up the black skunk

the black dutch, back of the old shed

if you can't live, you dying

you give or buy in

keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding

keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan

learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye



[Kid Cudi]

Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it

I can feel it slowly dripping away from me

no more chances if you blow this, you bogus

I will never ever let you live this down, down, down"

The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours

Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power

The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open

We ain’t got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling

With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands

In this white man world, we the ones chosen

So goodnight, cruel world, I’ll see you in the morning

Huh? I’ll see you in the morning

This is way too much, I need a moment

Fuck SNL and the whole cast

Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass

More specifically they can kiss my asshole

I’m an asshole? You niggas got jokes

You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon

My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in

And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic

He knows, he’s so fucking gifted

I just needed time alone with my own thoughts

Got treasures in my mind but couldn’t open up my own vault

My childlike creativity, purity and honesty

Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts

Reality is catching up with me

Taking my inner child, I’m fighting for custody

With these responsibilities that they entrusted me

As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece



Thinking no one man should have all that power

The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours

Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the powder

Till then, fuck that, the world’s ours

And they say, and they say

And they say, and they say

Colin Powells, Austin Powers

Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation

They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation

Well that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation

At the end of the day, god damn it I’m killing this shit

I know damn well y’all feeling this shit

I don’t need your pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick

I ain’t gotta power trip, who you going home with?

How 'Ye doing? I’m surviving

I was drinking earlier, now I’m driving

Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?

I got the power to make your life so exciting

(So excit-, so excit-, so excit-, so excit-)



Now this will be a beautiful death

I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go

I’m letting everything go

Now this will be a beautiful death

I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go

I’m letting everything go

Now this will be a beautiful death

Letting everything go

Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart

G-A-T in the Pathfinder

Cause you haters got PhDs

Y'all just some major haters and some math minors

Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron



Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches

You know the shit is fucking ridiculous

Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress

You know that shit is fucking ridiculous



One hand in the air if you don't really care

Two hands in the air if you don't really care

It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous

It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous

One hand in the air if you don't really care

Middle finger in the air if you don't really care

It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous

Life can be sometimes ridiculous"

I love it though
I love it though
[Chorus]
Uh put your hands to the constellations

they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation

I know I'm preaching to the congregation

we love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan

I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting

we ain't married but tonight I need some consummation



[Kanye West - Verse 1]

may the Lord forgive us

may the God's be with us

and that magic hour I seen good Christians make rash decisions

oh she do it, what happened to Religion?

oh she lose it

she putting on her make up

she casually allure

text message break up, the casualty of tour

how she gone wake up and not love me no more

I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off

hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme

hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron

I'm looking at her like this what you really want it, huh?

what we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime



[Chorus]

Uh put your hands to the constellations

they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation

I know I'm preaching to the congregation

we love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan (Satan, Satan, Satan)

I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting

we ain't married but tonight I need some consummation



[Kanye West - Verse 2]

When the sun go down its the magic hour

the magic hour

and outta all the colours that are still up the skies

you got green on your mind

I can see it in your eyes

why you standing there with your face screwed up

don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up

throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up

maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us

I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat

I ordered you jerk, she said ""you are what you eat""

you see I always loved your sense of humour

but tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was

the Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's Dior Homme not Dior homie

the crib scarface couldn't be more Tony

you love me for me could you be more phoney



[Chorus]

Uh put your hands to the constellations

they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation

haven't said a word, haven't said a word

to me this evening

Cat got your tongue?



[Rick Ross - Verse 3]

Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone

Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone

Stretch limousine, sippin' Rosé all along

Double-headed monster with a mind of his own

Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character

All black tux, nigga shoes lavender

I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders

Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired

Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder

We still speedin', runnin' signs like they don't matter

Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad

Never that when I'm in my favorite papertag

Therefore G4s at the Clearport

When it come to tools, fool I'm a Pep Boy

When it came to dope, I was quick to export

Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport

New Mercedes sedan, they'll export

So many cars DMV though it was mail fraud

Different traps, I was gettin' mail from

Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne

Whole clique, appetite had tapeworms

Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns

I shed a tear before the night's over

God bless the man I put this ice over

Gettin' 2Pac money twice over

Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller

I'm makin' love to the angel of death

Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps"

In your wildest

You could hear the loudest screams, comin' from inside the screen

You a wild bitch

Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy

Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy

Or do anal, or do a gangbang

It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing

Well I guess alotta niggas do gang bang

And if we run trains, we all in the same gang

Runaway slaves all on a chain gang

Bang bang bang bang bang

We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard

We'll have a mansion and some fly maids

Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bride's maid

She wanna role play, 'til I roll over

I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja

What party is we goin' to on Oscar day

'Specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de

La Renta, they wouldn't rent her they couldn't take the shame

Snatched the dress off her back and told her, ""Get away.""

How could you say they live they life wrong?

Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I'll call you bitch for short

As a last resort, and my first result

You call me motherfucker for long

At the end of it you know we both were wrong



But I love to play the blame game, I love you more

Let's play the blame game for sure

Let's call her names, names, I hate you, more

Let's call her names, names, for sure



On a bathroom wall I wrote

""I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else""

I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""

And I went and found somebody else

Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings

Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self

Till about two a.m. and I call back

And I hang up and I start to blame myself

Somebody help...



Let's play the blame game, I love you more

Let's play the blame game for sure

Let's call her names, names, I hate you, more

Let's call her names, names, for sure



You weren't perfect but you made life worth it

Stick around, some real feelings might surface

Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom

Gripping you up, fucking and choking you

What the hell was I supposed to do?

I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude

And if you are I hope you have a good time

Cause I definitely be having mine

And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional

Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you

Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you

Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?

You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you

Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you

1AM and can't nobody get a hold of you

I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?

Even though I knew, he never told the truth

He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to

At a certain point I had to stop asking questions

Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers

I heard he bought some coke with my money

That ain't right girl

You getting blackmailed for that white girl

You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl""

You'll probably find one of them ""I like art""-type girls

All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl

And I was satisfied being in love with the lie

Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame

For the pain and it poured every time when it rained

Let's play the blame game



Let's play the blame game, I love you more

Let's play the blame game for sure



""Things used to be, now they not

Anything but us is who we are

Disguising ourselves as secret lovers

We've become public enemies

We walk away like strangers in the street

Gone for eternity

We erased one another

So far from where we came

With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?

Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E

Hatred and attitude tear us entirely"" - Chloe Mitchell

Let's play the blame game for sure

Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more

Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much

I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

And when the phone called it just ring and ring

You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back

And I heard the whole thing

It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?

Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?

You know what, I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'mma thank him. I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker, I'm-a shoot a bootlegger!

That's how good I feel about this nigga

Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!

Die high blood pressure

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know,

Never know enough, 'til it's over love

'Til we lose control, system overload

Screamin' ""No! No! No! N-No!""

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to

See I wanna move, but can't escape from you

So I keep it low, keep a secret code

So everybody else don't have to know



[Chorus:]

So keep your love locked down

Your love locked down

Keepin' your love locked down

Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down

Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down

You lose



[Verse:]

I'm not lovin' you the way I wanted to

I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true

I got somethin to lose, so I gotta move

I can't keep myself, and still keep you too

So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own

Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone

How many times did I tell ya fo it finally got through

You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to

See I had to go, see I had to move

No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life

We're just wastin' time, where's the finish line



[Chorus:]

So keep your love locked down

Your love locked down

Keepin' your love locked down

Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down

Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down

You lose



[Verse:]

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to

I bet no one knew, I got no one new

I know I said I'm through, but got love for you

But I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to

Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' goin'

Keep it on a roll, only God knows

If I be with you, baby I'm confused

You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to

Where I wanna go, I don't need you

I've been down this road, too many times before

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to



[Chorus:]

So keep your love locked down

Your love locked down

Keepin' your love locked down

Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down

Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down

You lose, you lose

You'll never figure out real love [x3]
It's so crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about

No doubt

Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what love was about



Do you think I sacrificed real life

For all the fame, the flashing lights

Do you think I sacrifice, a real life

For all the fame, and flashing lights



There is no Gucci I can buy

There is no Louis vuitton to put on

They could sell

To get my heart out of this hill

My mind out of this jail

There is no clothes that I could buy

That could turn back a time

There is no vacation spot I could fly

That could bring back a piece of real life

Real life, what does it feel like?

I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight

What does it feel like, I ask you tonight

To live a real life

I just want to be a real boy

They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy

Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy

Pinocchio story goes to be a real boy



It's funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it?

I tell the truth and I keep running

It's like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something

I turn on the tv and see me and see nothing



What does it feel like to live real life to be real

Not some posiedon? on tv that no can really feel

Do you really have the stamina

For everybody that sees you and that say wheres my camera?

For everybody that sees you and says sign the autographs

For everybody that sees you and come and see you'll all that

You all that

I just want to be a real boy,

Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy

Pinocchio story goes



And there is no Gepetto, to guide me, no one right beside me

The only one was behind me I can't find her no more

I can't find her no more I can't,

The only one that come out on the tour and stays

Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream



And the fame will be got caught and the day I moved to LA

Maybe it was all my fault, all my fault to be a real boy

Chasing the American dream, chasing everything we seen, up on the tv screen

And the benz was left and the clothes was left, and the hoes was left you talk those hoes to death, pepping that money they depth [? ]



Real boy, they say kanye you keep it too real boy

Perspective, Wise man say, one day you'll find your way

The wise man say, you'll find your way

The wise man say, you'll find your way

Hey, I'm good



[Verse 1: Kanye West]

Welcome to the good life

Where niggaz that sell D

Won't even get pulled over in they new V

The good life, let's go on a living' spree

Shit they say the best things in life are free

The good life, it feel like Atlanta

It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami

It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh

(Now throw your hands up in the sky)

So I roll through good

Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari

And she got the goods

And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry

Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned

Haters give me them salty looks, Lowry's

50 told me go 'head switch the style up

And if they hate then let 'em hate

And watch the money pile up, the good life



[Hook:]

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

Now throw your hands up in the sky

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

Now throw your hands up in the sky

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, I'm good



[Verse 2: Kanye West]

Welcome to the good life

Where we like the girls who ain't on TV

Cause they got more (Ass than the models)

The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles

Till she feel boozed like she bombed out Apollo

The good life, it feel like Houston

It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.

It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye

Ayy, this is the good life



Homie, tell me what's good

Why I only got a problem when you in the hood

Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?

(I wish a nigga would)

He probably think he could, but, but

I don't think he should

50 told me go 'head switch the style up

And if they hate then let 'em hate

And watch the money pile up, the good life



[Hook:]

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

Now throw your hands up in the sky

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

Now throw your hands up in the sky



[T-Pain:]

I'ma put shit down

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, I'm good



[Verse 3:]

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane

While getting' some brain

Whipped it out, she said ""I never seen snakes on a plane""

Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz

Having' money's the everything that having' it is

I was splurging' on trizz

But when I get my car back activated

I'm back to Vegas cause

I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it

I close my eyes and imagine, the good life



[T-Pain:]

Is the good life better than the life I live

When I thought that I was gonna go crazy

And now my grandmamma ain't the only girl calling me baby

And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky

And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh

I'm good

When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.
I told God I'd be back in a second,
Man It's so hard not to act reckless.
To whom much is given much is tested.
Get arrested, got some chili, get the message.

I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,

And What I do? Act more stupidly.

Bought More Jewelry, More Louis V, My momma couldn't get through to me.

The drama, people suing me,

I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.

I'm just saying how I feel man,

I ain't one of the Cosby's I ain't go to Hill man

I guess the money should've changed him,

I guess I should've forgot where I came From.



Excuse Me, is you saying something?

Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing.



Let up the suicide doors.

This is my life homey, you decide yours.

I know Jesus died for us,

But I couldn't tell you who decide wars.

So I parallel double parked that motherf***er sideways

Old folks talking bout back in my day

But homey this is my day.

Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?

You know I already graduated

And you can live through anything if Magic made it.



They say I talk with so much emphasis,

OOOO They so Sen-Sa-Tive.

Don't ever fix your lips like collagen

Say something you gone end up apologing.

Let me know if it's a problem man,

Alright man, holla then.



Excuse Me, is you saying something?

Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing.



Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash,

Let that man get past.

You don't needa stop to get gas,

If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cuzz

How he move in a room full of nose?

How he stay faithful in a room full of h**s?

Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,

So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.

Treasure. What's you pleasure?

Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.

So if the devil wear Prada,

Adam Eve wear Nada,

I'm in between, but way more fresher.

But way less effort, cause when you try hard,

That's when you die hard.

Ya homies looking like ""Why God?""

When they reminisce over you, my god."

She don't believe in shootin stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartement

Courtois from the store's departments

You more like love to start shit

I'm more of the, trips to Flor-i-da

Order the hors d'oeuvres, views of the waters

Straight from a page of your favorite author

And the weather's so breezy

Man, why can't life always be this easy

She in the mirror, dancin so sleazy

I get a call like ""Where are you Yeezy?""

I try to hit you with the [?]old and wafty[?]

Till I got flashed by the Papparazzi

Damn, these niggaz got me

I hate these niggaz more than a Nazi



[CHORUS:]

As I recall I know you love to show off

But I never thought that you would take it this far

But what do I know

What do I know



[VERSE 2:]

I know it's been a while sweetheart, we hardly talk

I was doin my thing

I know it was foul baby every day lately

You've been all on my brain

And if somebody would've told me a month ago

Frontin though, yo I wouldn't wanna know

If somebody would've told me a year ago

It'd go get this difficult

Feelin like Katrina with no FEMA

Like Martin with no Gina

Like a flight with no VISA

First class with the seat back, I still see ya

In my past, you on the other side of the glass

Of my memory's museum, I'm just sayin

Hey Mona Lisa come home, you know you can't Rome without Ceasar

[CHORUS:]
Go ahead'n roll it up and pass it around...
Cuz there's been a lot of bullshit going down 
A lot of soldiers they ain't make it through this year 

So let's just celebrate that we still here and 

Whooooa, never leave me alone 

Tell 'em holla atcha boy 

Cuz I'll be coming home 

I'll be coming home 

Never leave me alone 

Tell 'em holla atcha boy 

Cuz I'll be coming home 

I'll be coming 



My homie called me like, ""What up, man?"" 

Not from Florida, but what up, fam? 

There's been a whole lot of hating again 

And if they hating on me, damn, what up then? 

I met this girl when I was three years old 

And what I love most, she had so much soul 

She said ""Excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me 

But uh, my name is Windy, and yo, I like to blow trees"" and 

From that point I never blow her off 

Come from out of town, I like to show her off 

They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off 

And make 'em straighten up they hat cuz she know they soft 

And when I grew up, she taught me how to go downtown 

And in the nighttime, her face lit up, so astounding 

I told her, in my heart is where she'll always be 

She never mess with entertainers cuz they always leave 

She said it feels like they walk and go from me 

Knew I was gang affiliated, got on tv, and told on me 

I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me 

She said ""'Ye, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"" 

But if you really cared for her 

Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport, and followed your dreams 

Sometimes I still talk to her 

But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talk about me 

She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you 

They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you 

But they just not you, and I just got through 

Talkin' 'bout what he tryin'a do, just not new"" 

Now everybody go the game figured out all wrong 

I guess you never know what you got til it's gone 

I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home 

And guess when I heard that, when I was back home 

In the interview I'm representing you, making you proud 

Shoot for the stars, so when you fall you land on a cloud 

Jumpin in crowds, sparkin' lighters, wave 'em around 

If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-town

Uh
My big brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother
Who was hip hop brother

Who was No I.D friend

No I.D My mentor

Now let the story begin



Its the hard knock life tour

Sell out, picture us in the mall

Copin iceberg and yell out Jigga

Yea that's what we would yell out

Yell out

You know the name dude

I gotta spell out or tell bout

J a y an Ye so shy

Now he won't even step to his idal to say hi

Standing there like a mom

Let the chance pass by

Back of my mind he could change your life

With all these beats I did atleast let him hear it

Atleast you could brag to your friends back at the gig

But he got me out my mama crib

Then he help me get my mama a crib



Big brother was Bigs Brother

Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother

Who was hip hop brother

Who was No I.D friend

No I.D my mentor

Now let the story begin

Let the story begin

If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands



Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline

Nothing handed out

I'm about to take mine

Around the same time of that BluePrint 1

Any beats in my pocket was that Blueprint form

I'd play my little song in that ol back room

He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you

But by the Black album I was blacking out

Party at S.O.Bs and we had packed the crowd

Big brother got his show up in Madison Sqare

And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there

But not only did I not get a chance to spit it

Carleen told me I could buy two tickets

I guess big brother was thinking a little different

Kept little brother at bay, at a distance

Put everything I felt was more focused

Only made me more focused

Only wrote more potent

Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over

I guess ill understand when I get more older

Big brother saw me at the bottom of the todum

Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrodum



My big Brother was Bigs brother

Used to be Dame and Bigs brother

Who was hip hops brother

Who was No I.Ds friend

No I.D my mentor

Now let the story begin

Begin

Let the story begin

If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands



Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant

Not only a client the presidito

Hola ovito

The game getting foul so here's a free throw

I was always on the other side of the peep hole

Then I dropped jesus walks now I'm on a steep hole

And we know

New jack city gotta keep my brother

But to be number 1 I'm a beat my brother

On that diamond remix I swore I spaz

Then my big brother came thru and kicked my ass

Sibling rivery, only I could see

It was the pride in me that was driving me

At the grammys I said I inspired me

But my big brother who I always tried to be

When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll

Cuz even if he gave me the rock its give and go

I guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk

And my shit was more like a finger roll

but I had them singles though

And them hoes at the show gonna minggle yo.

Ya know

I told Jay I did a song with cold play

Next thing I know he got a song with coldplay

Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way

Translate espanol

No way jose

Then I went and told Jay brown

Should of known that was gonna come back around

Should of told you like a man should of told you first

But I told somebody else that's what made shit worse



My big brother was Bigs brother

So here's a few words from your kid brother

If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um

People never get the flowers while they could smell um

A idel in my eyes, God of the game

Heart of the city,Rockafella chain

Never be the same, never be another

Number 1 young Hov also my big brother



My big Brother was Bigs brother

Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother

Who was hip hops brother

Who was No I.Ds friend

No I.D my mentor

And that's where the story ends



Don't kill this shit..."

[Kanye West]

Uh, Yeah, Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah



[Piano drops]



And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.

From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,

So this is in the name of love, like Robert says

Before you ask me to get a job today, can i atleast get a raise on a minimum wage?

And I know the gouverment administered AIDS,

So I guess we just pray like the minister say,

Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,

Things we see on the screen are not ours,

But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,

Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,

But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,

I guess they want us all behind bars.

I know it.



[Chorus (Adam Levine)]

Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.

(ooooooooo)

And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.

(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)

But we'll find a way

(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)



[Kanye]

They say people in your life are seasons,

And anything that happen is for a reason,

And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin',

And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin',

And Jesus and one day that ya see him,

Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him,

The devil is alive I feel him breathin',

Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',

And put those lottery tickets just to tease us,

My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down,

Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,

His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,

Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?

I can't figure it out...

Im Stickin around....



[Chorus (Adam Levine)]

Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.

(ooooooooo)

And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.

(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)

But we'll find a way

(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)



(Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,

And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

[Chorus 1]
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly

For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky



Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc,

Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.

I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox (locks).

Now let's go.

Take 'em back to the plan...

Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.

Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,

Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.

Let's take 'em back to the club.

Least about an hour I would stand on line,

I just wanted to dance.

I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.

I just wanted to shine.

Jay's favorite line: ""Dog, in due time""

Now he look at me, like ""Damn, dog, you where I am""

A hip hop legend.

I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.



[Chorus]



[Hook 1 (P. Diddy)]

Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la

(Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world)

Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la

(Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world)



Back when Gucci was the shit to rock,

Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,

I'd do anything to say ""I got it"".

Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.

Before anybody wanted K-West beats,

Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.

Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,

Like ""Damn, these niggas that much better than me?""

Baby, I'm going on an airplane,

And I don't know if I'll be back again.

Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,

But when she came to kick it, things became different.

Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.

I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long.

I'm trying to write my wrongs,

But it's funny these same wrongs helped me write this song.

Now,



[Chorus 2]

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly

For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky

(You gonna touch the sky babygirl!) Testify, come up in the spot

Looking extra fly

For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky



Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?

Lupe still like Lupin the Third.

Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb

Peach fuzz buzz but bit on the verge

Hold it down like we're on the serve

Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.

But, before you say another word,

I'm back on the block like a man on the street.

I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra,

But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.

Engarde, Touch© Lupe cool as the Unthar,

But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.

I come as correct as a porn star,

In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.

So, I represent the first.

Now, let me hear my verse right where the horns are like



[Chorus 2]



[Hook 2 (P. Diddy)]

(We back at home, baby)

Sky high

I'm, I'm sky high

I'm, I'm sky high

I'm, I'm sky high

I'm, I'm sky high

Yeah! (Keep it rollin)

Drive slow homey
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey

Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey



[Kanye:]

My homey Mali used to stay one 79th and May

One of my best friends from back in the day

Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones

He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone

Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off

Walk around the mall with his radio face off

Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand

Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man

Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's

Drove by the teachers even more by police's

How he get that cash today his father passed away

Left him with a little somthin 16 he was stuntin

Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy

Hit lakeshore girls go all crazy

Hit the freeway go at least bout 80

Boned so much that summer even had him a baby

See back back then then if you had a car

You were the Chi town version of Baby

And I was just a virgin a baby

One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy

I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked

Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked

We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall

They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all

With the girls a lot of flirting involved

But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws

So put me on with these hoes homey's

He said don't rush to get grown drive slow homey

Drive slow homie

Drive slow...

Ya never know homey about these hoes homey

Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey



[Paul Wall:]

What It do

I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'

The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing

Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac

Trunk open, screen's on, neon's lit with fifth relax

I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies

Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes

It's a star-studded event when I valet park

Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark

You see them 4's crawlin, you see them screens fallin

The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin

I'm leanin on a switch sittin crooked in my slab

But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab

A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla

Riding some candy coated crawlin like a caterpillar

I'm tippin on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw

I'm lookin for them hoes baby what it do?



[Chorus:]

Drive slow homey

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes

Drive slow homey

If you ridin around the city with nowhere to go

Drive slow homey

Live today cuz tomorrow man you never know

Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey

Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey



[Kanye:]

My cars like the movies my cars like the crib

I got more TV's in here then where I live



[GLC:]

And it don't make no sense but baby I'm the shit

And everything I flip you know is something serious

I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims

I got the baller genetics baby that's evident

You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced

That you should go and kiss it just a little bit

I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain

My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings

They see me hoes acting like they seen a king

With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green

My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues

My cylinder quiet like tip toes

I sold O's and this I know

When you see them hoes little homey drive slow



Chopped and Screwed

Yeah..

Drive slow homey

Drive slow homey

Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey

Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

Drive slow homey"

Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses

Pray to God that my arms reach the masses

The young smoke grass in grassless jungles

Rubber band together in cashless bundles

We wear strugglin chains, divided only hustle remains

Makin sense of it we hustle for change

Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin

Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson

Heights fightin for hits to heighten they hell

Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell

Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail

Children are unhailed

I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale - Horse""

got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it

How we stop the black panthers?

You hear that?

What Gil Scott was hearin

When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin.

Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland

We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch

And we been hangin from the same tree ever since

Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine

So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it,sell it

The fiends cop it 

Nowadays they cant tell if that's that good shit 

We ain't sure man 

Put the CD on your toungue yeah, thats pure man.

I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers
The doctor dont wanna take procedures

He claim my heart can't take the anastesia

It'll send her body into a seizure

The little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beeping,

Hey chick, im at a lost for words

What do you say at this time?

Remember when I was nine?

Tell her everything gone be fine?

But i'd be lying, the family crying

They want her to live, and she trying

I'm argueing like what kind of doctor can we fly in

You know the best medicine go to people thats paid,

If Magic Johnson got a cure for A.I.D.'s

And all the broke muthafuckers past away

You tellin me if my grandma was in the N.B.A.

Right now she'd be ok?

But since she was just a secretary

Working for the church

For thirty five years

Things sposed to stop right here

My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he strong,

Thats where I get my confidence from

I asked the nurse ""did you do the research?""

She ask me, ""can you sign some t-shirts?""

Bitch is you smokin reefer?

You dont see that we hurt

But still...

You can feel my heart beat, beat, beat

If she gone pull through

We gone find out soon

But right now she sleep, sleep, sleep

Hey chick what these doctors know anyway

Let me see the X-rays

I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt

Cousin Kim took off for work

Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Claire and Aunt Jean

So many Aunties, we could have an Auntie team

Feel like Amerie ""Its this one thing""

When they said that she made it

You see the eyes gleam

I think we at an all time high

To get there we run, we fly, we drive

Coz with my family we know where home is

So instead of sending flowers

We the roses...

I smile

The roses come to see me

And I can't wait for a sunny day

Can't wait for the clouds to break

But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive

'Cause when I was barely livin, that's what kept me alive

Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time

Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind

And get some lee way on the he say she say

You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay

Spanish girls say ""No able ingle""

And everybody want to run to me for their SINGLE

It's funny how these wack niggaz need my help

Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself

Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself

Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself

Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself

And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help

Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious

She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush

We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow

So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go

Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed

There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose

Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose

I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed

Roll up the doge, henny and c-c-c-cola, and I keep co coming over

[Kanye (Female Voice)]



Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good

Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would

Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could 

But... (You make me smile, With my heart)



I just wanted to ask you

Just wanted to um

Let how would I put this uhh

Let's say all your friends 

Remember the one

You said if you ever she would be the one

Ok, Ok, Ok (You make me smile with my heart)

I was thinking, hypothetically

I mean don't take this seriously

Don't take me: I mean just

Uhh not credibly 

I'm feeling incredibly

I mean let's see 

Just maybe

I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart)

I mean you, her and me

Maybe, Baby, Baby 

You know I was just kidding 

Unless you gon' do it



(You make me smile...)"

[Intro]
Diamonds are forever
They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me

They won't leave in the night

Have no fear that they might

Desert me



[Hook]

""Diamonds are forever forever forever""

Throw ya diamonds in the sky

If you feel the vibe

""Diamonds are forever forever forever""

The ROC is still alive 

Everytime I rhyme

""Forever and ever!""

For ever ever? for ever ever? ever ever?

Ever ever? ever ever? ever ever? ever ever?



[Verse 1]

Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam still

People lose hands, legs, arms for real

Little was known of Sierra Leone

And how it connect to the diamonds we own

When I speak of Diamonds in this song

I ain't talkin bout the ones that be glown

I'm talkin bout Rocafella, my home, my chain

These ain't conflict diamonds,is they Jacob? don't lie to me mayne

See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin', 

How? when I know of the blood diamonds

Though it's thousands of miles away

Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today

Over here, its a drug trade, we die from drugs

Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs

The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses

I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless

'til I seen a picture of a shorty armless

And here's the conflict

It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold

Spend ya whole life tryna get that ice

On a polar rugby it look so nice

How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?

'fore I beat myself up like Ike

You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause



[Hook]



[Verse 2]

[Kanye From Original Song]

People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (uh)

That'll be the same day I give the game back (uh)

You know the next question dog 'yo, where Dame at?'(uh)

This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back (whoo!)

'wassup wit you a Jay man, are ya'll okay man?'



[Jay-Z]

Yep!

I got it from her 'ye damn!

The chain remians, the gang is in tact

The name is mine, I'll take blame for that

The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? [laughs]

Pardon me I had to laugh at that

How could you falter when you're the rock of gibralter

I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water

This ain't no tour order, this is nothin to me

Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week

I do this in my sleep, 

I sold Kilos of coke, (so?) I'm guessin' I can sell CD's

I'm not a buisness man I'm a buisness, man

Let me handle my buisness, damn!

Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy

YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me

Bleek could be one hit away his whole career

As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire

And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere

So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah

He don't even have to write rhymes

The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes

Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin exactly

What I was sayin practically me whole carreer

The diamond is forever, I been mindin' this forever

Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better

People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'

Instead we rose from the ash like a phoenix

If you waitin' for the end, the dynasty signed

And what seemed like forever is a mighty long time

I'm young bitches [laughs]

Goodnight!"

[Chorus]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that yak, I wanna fuck

I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck

But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing

Towel under the door smoke until the days end

Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation

Hpnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser

Turn nothin to something now pimpin' that's a savior

Best things are green now pimp and get your paper

High off the ground instead of skyscraper

Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major



We major (come on, homie, we major) [repeat]



Feeling better than some head on a sunday afternoon

Better than a chick that say yes to soon

Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma

And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.

Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up

Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up

Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?

Get they first car and then IRS show up

He ain't never had shit but he had that nine

Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine

Put two and two together in a little bad weather

Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line

Ask the reverand was the strip club cool if my tips help send a pretty girl through school

That's all I want like wino's want they good whisky

I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me



[chorus]



[Nas:]

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write

First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?

Four-four's or black christ? Both flows would be nice

Rap about big paper or the black man's plight

At the studio consol asked my man to the right

What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?

He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic

Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel

Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed

Now I'm a free agent 

And I'm thinking it's time

To build my very own Motown

Cuz rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s

And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life

And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic

So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt

I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed

I survived the livest niggas around

Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns

Look, I used to cook before I had the game took

Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.



Feeling better than I ever felt before today

Like better late than never is orientation

Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

I want everybody to put they hands together for me
I want to talk about somebody real special tonight (whooooaaaa)
ok, come on
[Chorus]

Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you

'Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)

I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to school

I appreciate that you alive for me, I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)



[Verse 1]

I want to tell the whole world about a friend of mine

This little light of mine, I'm feelin' let it shine

I'm feelin' take y'all back to them better times

I'm feelin' talk about my momma if y'all don't mind (Hey Mama)

I was 3 years old when you and I move to the Chi

Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold

You fix me up something that was good for my soul

Famous home chicken soup, can I have another bowl (Hey Mama)

You work late nights just to keep on the lights

Mommy got me training wheels so I can keep on my bike

And you would give me anything in this world

Michael Jackson leather and the glove, but didn't give me a curl (Hey Mama)

And you never put no man over me, and I love you for that mommy can't you see

Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes

'Cause a nigga cheat and telling you lies, then I started to cry (Hey Mama)

As we knelt on the kitchen floor, I said mommy I'm a love you 'till you don't hurt no more

And when I'm older, you ain't got to work no more

And I'm a get you that mansion that we couldn't afford (Hey Mama)

See your unbreakable, unmistakable, highly capable, lady that's making loot

A living legend too, just look at what heaven do, send us an angel, and I thank you



[Chorus]

Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you

'Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)

I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to school

I appreciate that you alive for me, I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)



[Verse 2]

Forest Gump momma said, life was like a box of chocolates

My momma told me go to school, get your doctorate

Something to fall back on, you can profit with

But still supported me when I did the opposite (Hey Mama)

Now I feel like there's things I gotta get, things I gotta do

Just to prove to you, you was getting through

Can the choir please, gimme a verse of you, eyes so beautiful, to me (Hey Mama)

Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry, Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni

Turn one page and there's my mommy (Hey Mama)

Come on mommy just dance with me, let the whole world see you dance with thee

Now when I say hey, y'all say mama

Now everybody answer me



[Chorus]

Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you

'Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)

I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm going back to school

I appreciate that you alive for me, I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)



[Interlude]

I guess it all depends though, if my ends low

Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo, tint the windows

Ride around the city and let your friends know (Hey Mama)



[Verse 3]

Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out

Since you brought me in this world let me take you out

To a restaurant, up a echelon(?) I'm a get you a Jag whateva else you want (Hey Mama)

Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like

Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right

It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday, for me to just call and say



[Chorus/Outro]

Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you

'Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)

You know I love you so, I'm gonna let you go

I made this song just so you know no matter where you go I'm a love you.."

You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi

You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J

See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis

Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay

BROTHER NUMPSAY! Groupies sound too choosy

Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies

Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays

If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

Too late, we, gone - we strivin home

Gone - we ride on chrome

It's too late



[Kanye West]

Y'all don't want no prob from me

What you rappers could get is a job from me

Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn

I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr

Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn

Caught somethin on the Usher tour he had to ""Let it Burn""

Plus he already got three chil'run

Arguin over babysitters like, ""Bitch - it's yo' turn!""

Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you

Even your superficial raps is super official

R-R-R-Roc pastel with Gucci on

With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on

Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long

Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone

We strivin home, gone

[Cam] I ride on chrome...

We strivin home, gone

[Cam] Killa, I ride on chrome



[Cam'Ron]

Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?

Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true

Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer

Well here's the deal ma we goin to the {?}

No concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof

Act up, get out, I don't need you poof

Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag

Dag, niggaz still doin puff puff pass

Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em

Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit

Y'all niggaz want Killa Cam, cerebellum

An old man just gon' tell 'em (too late, he, gone)

Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (gone)

My last girl want me back then I'm on

Fine stay, you got the grind hey

Came back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone)

Yes I know you wanna see my demise

Yeah you church boy actin like a thief in disguise

Ain't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes

Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit

And that ain't leavin alive, please believe me

Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and

You can ask George or Regina

The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now

We strivin home, I ride on chrome

Listen homeboy move on

That's your best bet, why's that?

Cause



[Consequence]

Uhh, uhh, yo, yo

I been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone

And tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone

And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon

Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on

But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong

Now they askin Cons, how long has this gone on

And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head

Cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds

So I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed

And when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread

And with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts

And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks

But lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib

And rented ""Gone With the Wind,"" cause I'da gone about 10

But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar

And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car

And now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far

And now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars

And since I gone to a cell for some cruddy crimes

I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

Ah-head of my time, sometimes years out

So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out

And that make me wanna get my advance out

And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house

Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin it all behind

Kanye step away from the lime-

-light, like, when I was on the grind

In the ""One, Nine, Nine, Nine""

Before, model chicks was bendin over or

Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man

If I could just get one beat on Hova

We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa

What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old

Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro

My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural-fied

A week later the manager count the churros

Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow

How we out in Europe, spendin Euros

They claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE

I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on

I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's

Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free

But if they ever flip sides like Anakin

You'll sell everything includin the mannequin

They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston

Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin, stay calm

Shorty's at the door cause they need more

Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs

[Verse - Kanye West]

Man I promise, she's so self conscious

She has no idea what she's doing in college

That major that she majored in don't make no money

But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny

Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre

The concept of school seems so securrre

Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr

She like f**k it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair

Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs

Cause her baby daddy don't really care

She's so precious with the peer pressure

Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)

She had hair so long that it looked like weave

Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve

And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe

Single black female addicted to retail and well



[Chorus - (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]

Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down



[Verse - Kanye West]

Man I promise, I'm so self conscious

That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches

Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy

I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!

Then I spent 400 bucks on this

Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!

And I can't even go to the grocery store

Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team

It seems we living the american dream

But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem

The prettiest people do the ugliest things

butter road to riches and diamond rings

We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us

We trying to buy back our 40 acres

And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop

Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe



[Chorus - (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]

Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

Oh when it all, it all falls down

I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down





[Verse - Kanye West]

I say f**k the police, thats how I treat em

We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom

We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em

Things we buy to cover up what's inside

Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth

That's why shortys hollering ""where the ballas' at?""

Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack

And a white man get paid off of all of that

But I ain't even gon act holier than thou

Cause f**k it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou

Before I had a house and I'd do it again

Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz

I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific

I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific

I got a problem with spending before I get it

We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it

I'll fly away.
To a home on God's celestial shore,
I'll fly away.
I'll fly away, O Glory,

I'll fly away.

When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,

I'll fly away.



When the shadows of this life have flown,

I'll fly away.

Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm,

I'll fly away.



I'll fly away, O Glory,

I'll fly away.

When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,

I'll fly away.



Just a few more weary days and then,

I'll fly away.

To a land where joy shall never end,

I'll fly away.



I'll fly away, O Glory,

I'll fly away.

When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,

I'll fly away"

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky



[Verse 1: Kanye West]

Man, man, man

If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him

After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up

Let's go back, back to the Gap

Look at my check, wasn't no scratch

So if I stole, wasn't my fault

Yeah I stole, never got caught

They take me to the back and pat me

Askin' me about some khakis

But let some black people walk in

I bet they show off their token blackie

Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store

Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'

Takin' my hits, writin' my hits

Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind

This fuckin' job can't help him

So I quit, y'all welcome

Y'all don't know my struggle

Y'all can't match my hustle

You can't catch my hustle

You can't fathom my love dude

Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers

That's a different world like three summers

I deserve to do these numbers

The kid that made that deserves that Mayback

So many records in my basement

I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow



[Hook: GLC]

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky



[Verse 2: Consequence]

Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky

Let's go, yeah

And I didn't even try to work a job

Represent the mob

At the same time thirsty on the grind

Chi state of mind

Lost my momma, lost my mind

+My life, my love+ that's not mine

Why you ain't signed?

Wasn't my time

Leave me alone, work for y'all

Half of it's yours, half of it's mine

Only one to ball

Never one to fall

Gotta get mine

Gotta take mine

Got a tech nine

Reach my prime

Gotta make these haters respect mine

In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule wore headset nine

Puttin' known ass on shelves

Waitin' paitently I ask myself

Qhere I wanna go, where I wanna be

Life is much more than runnin' in the streets

Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat

Put me on my feet

Sound so sweet

Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee

Stayin' low key, nope

Holler at God ""Man why'd you had to take my folks?""

Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G

Love my G, Rolly G

Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's

Got a lot of people countin' on me

And I'm just tryin' to find my peace

Should of finished school like my niece

Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow

Aw man, all this pressure



[Hook: GLC]

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky



[Verse 3: Consequence]

I remember havin' to take the dollar cab

Comin' home real late at night

Standin' on my feet all damn day

Tryin' to make this thing right

And havin' one of my co-workers say ""Yo you look just like

This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night""

Well easy come, easy go

How that sayin' goes

No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows

I all had that snatched from me

And all the faculties all turn their back on me

And didn't wanna hear a rap from me

So naturally actually had to face things factually

Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me

Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair

I don't wanna ever go back there

So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off



[Hook: GLC]

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky



[Outro: GLC]

I wanna fly, I wanna fly

I said I want my chariot to pick me up

And take me brother for a ride"

Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace

And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus

Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is

I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is

Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard

Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method

They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us

Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""

Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?

We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases

A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis

My mama used to say only Jesus can save us

Well mama I know I act a fool

But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move

I hope

I know He hear me when my feet get weary

'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct

I ain't here to argue about His facial features

Or here to convert atheists into believers

I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers

The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus

So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this

They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus

That means guns, sex, lies, videotape

But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?

Well if this take away from my spins

Which'll probably take away from my ends

Then I hope this take away from my sins

And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about

Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

Yeah Grandmama
Told you i won't let you down
Told you i won't let this rap game change me, right?



[Chorus:]

When it comes to being true, at least true to me

One thing i found,one thing i found

Oh no you'll neva let me down,

Get up i get(down)

Get up i get(down)

Get up i get(down)

Get up i get(down)

Get up i get(down)

Get up i get(down)



[Jay-Z:]

Yo, yo first i snatched the street then i snatched the charts,

First had they ear now i hav they're heart,

Rappers came and went,

I've been hear from the start,

Seen them put it together

Watch them take it apart,

See the Rovers roll up wit ribbons

I've seen them re-poed, re-sold and re-driven

So when i reload, he holds #1 position

When u hot i'm hot

And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin

It's plain to see

Nigga's can't f*** wit me

Cuz ima be that nigga fo life

This is not an image

This is God given

This is hard liven 

Mixed wit crystall sippin

It's the most consistent

Hov

Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and

Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin

It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap

I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy



[Chorus]



[Kanye West:]

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma 

Made her sit that seat where white folks aint wanna us to eat

At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in

With that in my blood i was born to be different

Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership

But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership

That's why I hear new music 

And i jus dont be feelin it

Racism still alive they jus be consealin it 

But i know they don't want me in the damn club

They even made me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club

I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed

Swear I've been baptised at least 3 or 4 times

But in the land where nigga's praise

Yukons and getting paid

It gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved

Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves

Notin sadder than that day my girl father past away

So i promised to MR.rany i'm gonna marry your daughter 

And u know i gotta thank u for they way that she was brought up

And i know that u were smiling when u see that car i bought her

And u sent tears from heaven when u seen my car get balled up

But i can't complaint what the accident did to my left eye

Cuz look what a accident did to left eye

First Aaliyah and now romeo must die

I know a got angels watchin me from the other side



[Chorus x2]



[J.Ivy:]

We are all here for a reason on a particular path

You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math

Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious

That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world

I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls

I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this

That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him

So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical

I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument

My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental

That's why I'm instrumental

Vibrations is what I'm into

Yeah, I need my loot by rent day

But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte

I'm tryina give us ""us free"" like Cinque

I can't stop, that's why I'm hot

Determination, dedication, motivation

I'm talking to you, my many inspirations

When I say I can't, let you or self down

If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff

And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip

I would never, ever let you down

And when these words are found

Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love

That's why my breath is felt by the deaf

And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind

I, too, dream in color and in rhyme

So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house

Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth

A touch of God reigns out



[Chorus]



[Jay-Z (Kanye West)]

Who else you know been hot this long,

(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)

Started from nothing but he got this strong,

(The ROC is in the building)

Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,

Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,

Let you tell that man I'm falling, 

Well somebody must've caught him,

Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,

Number one albums, what I got like four of dem,

More of dem on the way,

The Eight Wonder on the way,

Clear the way, I'm here to stay, 

Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay, 

Dissin' Jay 'ill get you mased,

When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,

Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,

Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,

The way y'all all follow Jigga,

Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,

Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive"

N-n-n-now, my flow

Is in the pocket like Wallace, I got the bounce like hydrolics

I can't call it, I got the swerve like alchoooool-ics

My freshman year I was goin through hell, a problem

Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta collllllll-ege

My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me

I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna folllllllllll-ow

My heart, and if you follow the charts, to the plaques or the stacks

You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see

I'm so shy that you thought it was bashfull but this

And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro

And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro

N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this

You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubblee

At NYU but she headed from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chillin on

campus

Sent me a picture with a feelin on Candice

Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis

W-H-I-T, it's gettin late mami, your screen saver say tweet

So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend

His name Kweli

(You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib)

I mean

(That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)

I mean

(You don't really know him, why is you lyin)

Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pickup the line

She gon' think that I'm lyin, just spit a couple of lines

Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high



[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]

Yeah

I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin up dolls but

GET EM HIGH, I need some tracks you tryin to pull tracks out

And my rhymes as fittin to blow you tryin to blow back south

Well ok, you twisted my arm, I'll asist with the charm, aiyyo

I though you meet that chickit that got friends with yo moms

And she's the bomb, boy she got the boujI behavior

Always got somethin to say like a bookee playa hater

Anyway, I don't usualy fuck a interneter

Draws stuck to they arm like Nicorette

You really fuckin that much, you tryin to get off cigarettes

And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet

I appoligize if I come off a little inconsiderate

I got the bubble cushion a sister could get ahead of it



[Verse 4: Common]

Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke

A high filled with dope

Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes

The real nigga quotes

Real rappers is hard to find, like a remonte, control rap is not a

Used soup it still got life, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs

Rock clubs, it's like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show

Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggaz in you

You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you

How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead

I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is to sexy to even make songs like these

That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys

To many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is populer

Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin her

Album, how come, you the hot garbager

The years clear your image and snooped up

Label got you souped up, tellin you you sick

Man you a dick with a loose nut

Video hard to watch like Medusa

Even your club record need a booster

Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illeaterate nigga

Read the infa, red across your head I'm bread king like Simba

Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper

You dansin for money like honey, I did this my way

So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye

Spittin through wires and fires, emcees retirin

Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then



[Chorus: Kanye West]

N-now, th-th-through ya motherfuckin hands

GET EM HIGH

All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin man

GET EM HIGH

Now I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands

KEEP EM HIGH

You just popped in the Kanye West
Get right for the summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
you might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car

So first of all we gon' work on the stomach

Nobody wants a little tight ass!



[Verse 1]

1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and

Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this

Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave

Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed

Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed

It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited

Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick

What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me

So excuse me miss, I forgot your name

Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..

I came...

I came..

It's been a week without me

and she feel weak without me

She wanna talk it out but

Ain't nothin' to talk about

'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out

Work it out (Come on) [4x]

Work it out now

Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)



[Verse 2]

Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette

My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said get it wet

Ooh girl your breath is HARSH

Cover your mouth up like you got SARS

Off them tracks yea I bought them cars

Still killa a nigga on 16 bars

We ain't sweatin' to the oldies we jukin to a cold beat

Maybe one day girl we can bone

so you can brag to all your homies now

But I still mess with a big girl if you ain't fit girl I'll hit girl

1 and you brought 2 friends OK 3 more now hop in the Benz

Four door do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8

All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates

You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating

Hustlers, gangstas, all us, ballas



[Chorus]

It's been a week without me

and she feel weak without me

She wanna talk it out but

Ain't nothin' to talk about

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross, a little Anita, will definitely set this party off right

(Are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are you gonna be are you gonna be, well well well well well)

[Kanye West]

I told her to drive over in your new whip

Bring some friends you cool with

Imma bring da cool whip

Then I want you to strip

See you is my new chick

So we get our grind on

She be grabbin, callin me Biggie like Shine home

Man I swear she fine homes

Why she always lying though

Tellin me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones

She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson

Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson

I play 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action

My dawg said you aint no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong

Imma play this Vandross 

You gon' take your pants off

Imma play this Galdys Knight

Me and you gon' get right



[Chorus X2]



[Twista]

I can tell you aint no messin with Kan-man and Twist

Tryina smoke a B

Lookin properly

Feelin on a G?

And always (Well Well Well Well Well)

Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne

You aint know Twista can work it like the Whispers

Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac

The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners

While I'm

Smokin on a B

Dippin through the streets

Bumpin R&B

And I got to leave

something to the 23's?

And I do it (well well well well well)

When my earth and the wind smoke a fire

Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat

Put you in a daze for maze

Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex

You ready for the world girl 

Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me

An every moment you controllin' me I'm lovin the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci

And when I come over and bend your ass

You be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass

I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow

Now I gotta go up in it fast, but imma finish last

No matter how much of a thug you see

I still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me

And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and stilla be in love with me

You gots to roll with the plan

Cuz after that then I

Take it to the dome

Then I got to bone

Stay up in the zone

And we could get it on

Just to get you goin' 

Tryina make you moan

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out

Girls go wild and pull ya deez out

Breathe in, breathe out

Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out

If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out

When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""



[Verse 1: Kanye West]

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap

I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)

But is it cool to rap about gold

If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)

First nigga with a Benz and a backpack

Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack

Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant

But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again

And it's still about the Benjamins

Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms

Strippers named Cinnamon

More chips than Pentium

What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is

I'm tryin' to spend my stacks

And I'm so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""

I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?

What the hell was wrong with me dog?

Sing along with my y'all



[Hook: Ludacris]

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out

[Verse 2: Kanye West]

Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick

I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick

Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this

And givin' head is like 'oh well, the shoes and the toothpick'

Well, I'm in the club for a limited time

Act now and get some action for $3.99

Later on I might charge for ménage

Heard her man was the boss of the floss

But she still want to toss me the drawers

And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy

Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club

And I'm still actin' calm than a mug

She asked ""Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?""

While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man

Baby I fully understand

Let me help you with a plan

While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga

Give ME some head, that'll really piss hI'm off

When I pull a piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""



[Verse 3: Kanye West]

I blow past low class niggas with no cash

In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask

So when I go fast popo just laugh

Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash

Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst

Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon

Pullin' up in the Lexuses/'lexeses, one on both hand

So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous

Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages

""K I need a free hand mammogram

I got weed, drink, and a Handicam

All of which is legal in Amsterdam""

So say my name like Candyman

And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman

But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave

You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe



[Hook: Ludacris]

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out

If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out

Push a big truck, pull ya keys out

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert

Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp

That right there could drive a sane man berserk

Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work

How do you console my mom or give her light support

Tellin' her her son's on life support?

And just imagine how my girl feel

On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till

She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine

She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign

No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed

Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines

In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died

The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man

Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band

I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man



Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall

- I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man -

For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all

- They got my mouth wired shut for like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks -

Through the fire, through whatever, come what may

- Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw, I looked in the mirror

And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it -

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way

- But I'm still here for y'all right now, man -

Right down to the wire, even through the fire

- This what I got to say right here, dawg, yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh -



What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal

On the hottest rap label around?

But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds

It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?

And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory

And what we need to do in the game

Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time

In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed

If you could feel how my face felt

You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)

Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt

I swear to God, driver two wanna sue

I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe

My dawgs couldn't tell if I…

I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised

There's been an accident like GEICO

They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael

I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass

Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?

Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past

Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash

And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid

Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did

But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph

Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire



Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall

- Y'know what I'm sayin'? When the doctor told me I had, um -

For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all

- That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said -

Through the fire, through whatever, come what may

- ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"" -

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way

- ""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

You can't be serious, man -

Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Verse 1: Kanye West]

This is family business

And this is for the family that can't be with us

And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us

That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet

Like a photo of your granny's picture

Now that you're gone it hit us

Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right

Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be light

Somebody please say grace so I can save face

And have a reason to cover my face

I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it

Pumpkin bread on the side, know how the family do it

When I brought it why did God have to look all to it?

As kids we used to laugh

Who knew that life would move this fast?

Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?

And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it

And if you did, then that's family business

Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture

Hey B, remember when they ain't believe in me?

Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV""

Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it

And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite

I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider

But when we get together be electric slidin'

Grandma, get 'em shook up

Aw naw, don't open the photo book up

I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name

But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane

You know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude

But every holiday nobody eatin' her food

And you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins

Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins

Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins

Fit three in the bed while six of y'all

I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg

But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns

Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God

And keep your face to the risin' sun

All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog

And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog

I feel like one day you'll understand me dog

You can still love your man and be manly dog

You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'

Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman

Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?

The second he storm out then she storm in

Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion

And drink some wine like Communion

And act like everything fine and if it isn't

We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

[laughing]
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
'Cause they don't fucking..



(I'd like to propose a toast)

(I said toast motherfucker)



[Chorus: Kanye]

And I am

And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them

Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky

This is the last call for alcohol, for the..

So get your ass up off the wall



[Verse 1]

The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac

The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc

I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame

And come back next year with the whole fucking game

Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top

They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop

Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself

Rocafella's only niggaz that help

My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair

Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here

They say he bourgie, he big-headed

Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is

Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds

I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas

It's funny how wasn't nobody interested

'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus



[Chorus]



[Verse 2]

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir

Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Tes sir

Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest

But all they got left is this guy called West

Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def

Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z

I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh

It come out sweeter than old Sadie

Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards

Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards

And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye

I'm almost reignin'

Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?

It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him

Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine

Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme

Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem

Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams

I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed

But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh

So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more

You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more

You can't say shit to Kanye West no more

I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga

I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don

Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom

I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards

I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars

I went to the malls and I balled too hard

'Oh my god, is that a black card?'

I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term

African American Express

Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell

Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to

Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit

Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips



[Chorus]

""... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz""



[Outro]

So this A&R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop

picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him

I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do

I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin?""

I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""

Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone

going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats

And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers

cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID

And No ID told him, ""look man, you wanna mess with Kanye

you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""

[No ID:] ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not

but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop:] ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"",

I'm like oh shit

I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also

People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production

But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here

So you know. After they picked that Truth beat

I was figuring I was gonna do some more work

But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago

I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts

just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy

get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something

or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then

I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample

I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like ""oh, yo that shit is crazy

Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty.""

And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me

so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time

and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like

with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style

when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album

I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound

You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time

I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with

Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm

sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did

for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he

gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I

came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""oh

you a real soulful dude"" [Jay-Z: ""you a real soulful dude""]. And he

uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got

to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said

[Jay-Z:] ""check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""

""tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking

like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't

want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my

personal opinion. So he asked me, ""what you think of it?""

[Jay-Z:] ""so what you thinkin?""

And I was like, ""man that shit tite,""

you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train

man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just

in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got

acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like

poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one

of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through

my production company, but he ended up going straight with the

company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad

news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at

the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took

that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about

ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal

with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to

[Mother:] ""Come on, let's just go""

Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.

I remember I pulled up

[Mother:] ""Kanye, baby, we're here"",

I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a

bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and

the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'

And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up

there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I

played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone

he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at

that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket

hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said

""yo play that one beat for him."" And I played 'Heart of the City.' And

really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.

[Hiphop:] ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"".

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that

GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of

them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen

Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like ""yo what's up I'm Kanye.""

[Dame:] ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""

""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?

Yo, this nigga got classics""

[Dame:] ""Jay got classics, G.""

You know I ain't talkin shit.

I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm

still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show

The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my

eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all

these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one

thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be

Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton

sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John

Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the

time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I

spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical

shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his

eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap

was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.

He said ""man that was tite.""

[Jay-Z:] ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.

Okay, fast forward.

So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just

took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship

with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my

career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me

to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at

this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had

relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so

they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound

like Jay-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them

these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll

be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy

'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever

Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they

didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked

with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the

company that'll say ""naw."" Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my

nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man

[Jessica:] ""Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""

I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up

""Y'all niggaz is stupid"". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.

The nigga that was behind me, I mean,

he wasn't even a nigga, you know?

The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol

Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.

[Joe:] ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""

Dame was like, ""yo you got a deal with Capitol,

okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""

[Dame:] ""you gotta make sure it's not wack.""

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to

play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and

Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll

never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow

I got eleven plaques on my walls right now

You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""

Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So

I play that song for him, and he's like ""oh shit""

[Dame:] ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""

""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""

[Dame:] ""it's actually kinda hot.""

Like they still weren't looking at me

like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole

album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and

save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's

like ""yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick""

[Dame:] ""you don't wanna catch a brick""

You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.

I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with

that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was

already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you

know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I

was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm

not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer

rapper"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--

the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do

man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio

sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes

man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said

""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

[Mel:] ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""

And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested

and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying

to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I

called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?"""
