If you want three, that's sixty

Had Charlie, man, I had Whitney

Had Bobby, man, I had Britney

Criminal pickney now I got large amounts

Boy, I need a different account

I cannot sit in the house

All my niggas tryna eat

I need to figure it out

Just tell me the floor, show me the door

My niggas kicking 'em down

Flicky in the whip, they wish I would slip

But I cannot give 'em the clout



Got my dream girl in my real life

In the dunya but I'm living nice

Bought a chain, didn't see the price

Diamonds on me, that Vanilla Ice

Who said that I'm civilised?

I'm a villain, you can see it in my eyes

Spin the wheel, tryna win the prize

Hit the jackpot, split it with the guys

Man, I been the guy



I'ma whip that crack like banana pudding again (Hee, hee)

When I step in the bando, fiends and the workers act like Vladimir Putin just came (Just came)

Niggas taking the wave

Just let 'em have fun with it, tell 'em to run with it (Ha, yeah, yeah)

I got some coke at my sister's

I got a gun in my brother's crib (Grrah, hee)

And if we see 'em on the mains, that's fire on the mains (Huh, fire on the mains)

Got a little three-two concealed in my boxers, call that fire in the mains (Fire in the mains)

I was on tour with the hittas on deck, had fire on the stage (Hee, hee)

Bro's so tapped, if he see a opp little sister, he'll probably fire off the stage



What do you reckon?

How I survive? Impeccable tekkers

No point rocking a vest when you stepping

Neck and above how niggas be wetting

Cheffing, kweffing, shooting, booting, London's mad

End of discussion

Fuck all the talk, my nigga, do sumtin'

You're not the GOAT, my nigga, you mutton

I was 18 in hella jewels

Now I'm 28 in hella jewels

I'll be 38 in hella jewels

You been hating on me, who the hell are you?

Chip in the dance, two-step bussin'

If I got my Cuban on, I won't tuck it

Look in my corner, he just see artists

Ain't got a clue that the mandem will rush him (Mad mad)

Hands on man, no hands on grams, but I still got my hands on grands

Gyal in my bed straight after the booth

Damn right, got hands on plans

Scales in my rucksack cah' I gotta weigh my ting when it lands

Two and a Q, no intent to supply

I get high, it's a percy pack



I had to buss my hood like I was outside in the rain

Anyone can dead

Push me to the edge, I'm gripping the pole like I'm riding the train

Niggas ain't shooting, niggas just gassing it, I put a rack on it

All my niggas is savages

Bought a skeng and then I park it by the garages

See your girl on the ends

Now she wanna be friends

I look in her eyes

And I see she want a friends with benefits, no, we ain't gotta pretend

Ex man talk about beef, man catch him eating chicken and fries

Yeah, you might see my niggas in the video

But they're coming in disguise



Hop out, a nigga surprised (Uh huh)

Sold out Ally Pally twice (Uh huh)

VVS and all the ice with boogers

Mesmerise memories (Uh huh)

Treating the Range like a sports car

And I ain't never seen another nigga do it big

Saw what I spent on my daughter

Now she's screaming ""Goals"" and she wanna have my kids

Let the fiend try that dark, she said Jesus, Nazareth

Mummy hit me on WhatsApp

Jakes are looking for me where my nanny lives

Last night I was bagging up crack and dark on my silver plaque

If a nigga try rob my gold, that's bronze tips in that silver wap

And I just put coke on the stove, gotta turn it down

Gotta turn on the tap

I got a nigga on the way but the crack ain't dried yet

He want a 4 and half, I just turn on the fan

He want a 4 and half, I just turn on the fan

Tell the opps that we got larger waps

Cum in her pussy, a lava lamp



Growing up now, I gotta move different

I only cheat if it's two women

Baby girl told me she want to be wifey

I asked her, ""What do you do different?""

Good girl said she want a man like me

She want a man like me cah' I've never been nicked

I was 18 tryna buy me a crib

You want to talk on my name

But you've never been lit

Can you handle the fame? You know you're fucking with a star

When you're fucking with me, they talk about you in the press

Took a little time just to get it together

Better late then never

Matching Alyx hoodies for the rainy weather

Keep on loving (You, you, you, you)

Don't, don't take it personal

I've been waiting just like seven days so I can taste it, taste it

And she asking, ""Can you fill me in to Craig David, David?""

I was surprised she sucked me so good with her braces

And I told her, ""I'm a monster, baby, can you face it?""



Ayy, she cut me off, now we talk again

Seattle Gold my collection of rose

But I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain

Sweet tooth gyally wanna top this boy

Can't let your environment trap your mind, gotta clock the puzzle

I know niggas who are down but up, I know niggas who are up but down

Getting money don't end these struggles

Things on the brain, but I don't complain

The new me learned from the old me

Stay low-key, I still roll deep

Got a man that you talk to

Man wanna jump on the wave, don't let him get cosy

Ask me to describe myself in one word, I'd rather use an emoji

Wanna flex like, ""No, you don't know me""

Can't pay the rent but you just bought a stony

You'll see, a wise man once told me

You gotta live within your means

You got a pocket full of cash

But you gotta have a lot more than what's in your jeans

No time to sleep, you better take a nap

Wake up, put in the work, and live the dream

It ain't overnight to get from the bottom to the top, there's a lot of shit in between

Haters gonna intervene

Try pull you out

I realise there ain't nothin' to talk about

You gotta kill 'em with success, show them what focus is all about

Stop getting it twisted

You had a chance to shine, too bad that you missed it

That's what you get for gossipin' online

Every day sippin' on tea, please get him a biscuit



I'm just minding' my business, no, we ain't watchin' anyone else (No)

Wanna hate on me, that's useless, truth is that you must hate yourself (Trust)

North Korean, Kim Jong-un when I spray the machine

You're on the other side if you ain't on my team



You get blacklisted if you hate on my team

Fam, I say what I mean, I keep my demons close

Late night, I speak to the ghost

Get high, fell asleep in my clothes

Keep suttin' on me, 'cause I'm better safe than sorry

I'm a top boy like Sully with a six figure hobby

You're still on the road, better be getting that belly

Kicking off doors, better give it some welly

I came in the game, ran it like an athlete

Got a big money scheme, all my bruddas had to eat

Thought I was a scrub, sitting in the backseat

I was counting my money, making sure it's complete

They can't compete, there ain't no competition

I take what I want, you get what you were given

They calling me a rapper, man, I think I'm a magician

I didn't wanna kill 'em, but these niggas never listen

You're on the other side if you ain't on my team



As soon as I wake up I be chasing my dreams

All we do is win and we ain't changing the teams

I still creep through the hood

Pull up on my brudda just to see if he's good

See them with the gang, they be giving me looks

See him on his ones, I can see that he's shook

Mad 'cause I made it

New whip looking like a spaceship

You looking like you're stuck inside the Matrix

I could teach you how to hustle, how to save it

When the money talks, I can translate it

I'm the go-getter

G'd up with my feet up, it's no pressure

They make threats, but they never put their hands on me, they know better

You will get pepper, hot like Coachella

You're not clever, you're coming unstuck

I was up North, I was getting 'nuff love

Back down South, tryna make a young buck

And I'll be still be going when the sun comes up

Man, I've been going through it

Been keeping it too real

Man, I've been going through it

I don't wanna talk about it

I don't wanna get into it

Party going stupid soon as I step into it

Ask about me, they tell you I'm one of the best to do it

And I know they don't like me but they gotta respect the music

Got suttin' in the glove compartment and I won't pet to use it

She told me her favourite song, now we just sexing to it

Got the bass bumping

Turn it up loud, neighbours ain't saying nuttin'

Everyday's my birthday, everyday manna cake cutting

New chain, dripping in water, got the place flooded

Bruce Wayne, top of the building, man I see them coming

She's got the big back, look at the jeans busting

Picked her up in a Wraith, just look at the babe blushing

Said I'll be here at 7 o' clock, well now it's 8 suttin'

Gotta get more organised, cah fam, I hate rushing



Man, I keep getting caught up

Showing love to everybody



Man, I been going through it, tryna make 'em see the vision

Try to explain myself, that was the worst decision

Thought that I could change the world, turn me into a villain

Gotta learn to practice silence, follow my intuition

Stayed in the house, phone number off limits

Stress on the brain, complain, but I know that it's all self-inflicted

Man, I gotta take a break, I'm gonna need a minute

Soon as I catch a vibe, somebody tryna kill it

Boy, stop it

Never seen you putting your hand in your pocket

Time to pay the bill, I know you can't find your wallet

Where were you in the trenches when the opps were tryna bomb it?

Now you're coming around, and niggas tryna get the gossip

I put in the work, get the bag and split the profit

And if I'm honest, I know that I should be modest

But I don't see no competition in the game and I'm pissing on it

If it ain't about the family, then I'm ghost and that's a promise



Niggas need to wake up

Trust



I blew out the candles, everybody scream my name

Told me to make a wish, look at what I became

Look how they look at me, never gonna be the same

Said they wanna be like me, you don't know what you're sayin'

Always been a daredevil, man, I was born from pain

They say ignorance is bliss, but I think that's a shame

Bird Box, you don't wanna see this boy get out the rain

Stay inside, I'll be fine, man, I got myself to blame

Man, I've been going through it



Oh my days, what the fuck?

He's not good for you, he's really not

He's a fucking mad 'ead

He's not listening

Who were you linkin' before me?

And I hope she don't ask me back

I've run out of excuses

The truth is I'm so cold, I'm so frozen

Too many times my heart has been broken

And I can't even do the fake love, there ain't no pretendin'

Thought that I found my partner-in-crime, my co-defendant

But it's like watchin' a film and you already know the endin'

See me, I think I think too much

Try to keep it short and sweet but I say too much

Now she wanna go back and forth, she wanna play two touch

It's back to square one

Both said things that shouldn't have been said

Did things that shouldn't have been done

I rock and roll, I don't like the stress

Now the friendship's based on how quick I reply to text

She's talkin' reckless, I gotta bite my tongue

Don't wanna say anything I might regret

Died a thousand deaths

Man, I wore so much Ed Hardy, how could I forget?

That love kills slowly

Still, everybody tryna do holy matrimony

More time, one of them needs a trophy

And the other one's scared to be lonely

Every day another one falls off

They link the wrong ting and got way too cosy

Valentine's Day, it's all sweet and rosy

Spend every other day just tryna score points like Kobe

Nobody wants to lose but the winner gets nothin'

Spent summer time stuntin'

Then winter time comes, everybody starts cuffin'

You know love takes time

But relationship goals got everyone rushin'

You get a feelin' it's way too good to be true

So now you just tryna find somethin'

Tryna find a reason

Friends askin' me how I'm doin'

I said, ""Same shit, different season""

My ex got a new boyfriend, I'm just tryna get even

We don't hate each other, no, we just came to the end of the road

She went one direction, I went the other

Guess I gotta find me a new lover

To be able to pull off this outfit

With the trainers, you gotta have serious pace (Yeah)

Got money on my brain, it's a serious chase

Co-D on remand, that's a serious case (Mad)

So when man wanna act like Tyson

I'm like what, fam? Am I supposed to be frightened? (Dead)

Say you bust gun, we don't believe you

You don't pray, TBH, you need to

Say that he's a badboy, I was like me too

Shoot from up 'cross the road when I see you (Sky)

Fuck your war story, I've been there when the beef get gory (Facts)

I'm from the UK just like Devlin, but I'm a yardman like Cory



Tryna be gangster

Tryna be gangster, your cartel are not up to the time

Tryna be gangster

Tryna be gangster, pattern up, better get back on the grind



It's all an act and movie (Yeah)

See through them, but they can't see through me (Nope)

Man wanna act like gangsters, when I see man

Manna move like groupies

These man are happy inside

But when I see man, they start moving booky (Booky)

Friday night, when I smoke like booky (brucky)

Don't get nicked by the feds on duty

Might pop corn cah my team's unruly

Bare badmana move Shy like Snoochie (Snoochie)

Them man there better follow my orders

Run a man down like Sloth in Goonies (Hey, you guys)

I send a man hot shots just like shoot it, shoot it

Them man are sleeping, snoozing, snoozing

Us man are winning, not losing



Somebody tell these ediats with two hundred pound belts and shiny trainers (Please)

Stop tryna imitate guys on road, you cannot buy G status (Trust)

Give a shit what garms you cop (No), don't give a shit what crap you drop (What?)

Waste of money and time, please stop (Trust)

You cannot buy gangster from shop

Bare logos, bare designers

Hate when I hear pricks misuse slang

Man are tryna get out the hood but, you were never there so you're tryna get in (What?)

Backwards ting (What?), cool

Make sure your hood's up when it starts raining (Serious)



Yeah, we did young and stupid

Now I do grown and sexy

I don't know who you're tryna impress, G

Man, can see that your man-bag's empty

No need to pretend

I don't wanna hear you talk greazy again

Never shot food, never shot no skeng

Talk about gangster, I was like, ""When?""

Brudda, you love lie

Tryna been gangsta, you ain't never been on one ride

Tough guy

Tryna be gangsta, your cartel are not up to the time

I, wake up, brush my teeth, choose an outfit

Big racks in my account, I get paid

Everyday smoke the loudest

I get packs in by the ounce I just blaze

And I got tings from back in the day

Still ringing me down I'm on stage

But I want no stress

Bruddah tryna control S coming around to get saved

I don't wanna war let's make peace

Good energies make the stacks increase

Girls in the North, West, South and the East

Big batty make the mandem say jheeze

I'm not a gentleman I'm an African man

That's what I said to the priest

So you know I stay smoking trees

She weren't feelin' the old me, I bet she's feelin' my new shit

I told her we gotta keep it true, told her we gotta move as a unit

I had to chat to Cupid, said, ""little man you know I ain't stupid""

Told you that it's more than music, paps outside tryna get an exclusive

Instead of looking for the top boy, must've been looking for me but who's asking

I clocked the game I'm still barrin', please don't speak to me when I'm dancing

Everyday they pray that I fall off, I'm popping up like ""what's gwarning?""

They say a girl is a gun, see a man walking with his wife and I disarm him

The way I stepped in there in with the Sk Air, fam serious tekkers

Brand new vest, same old leathers, she knows we are the real Goodfellas

We can be cool, yeah we can ride out, please just don't get jealous

Start texting me crazy I gotta take desperate measures

By now you should know I hate waitin'

I got no patience

Right now man are tryna get out the matrix

Far from the agents

Tryna stay far from the devil in the red dress

Far from the pagans

Only time man are gonna see me again

Is if I share location



Cause when you are talkin' 'bout me online

I was down in the basement

Ex girl said that I'm never at home

So she found a replacement

Said, ""You was on the road

But I never seen you when I was out on the pavement""

The police wanna set me up

They wanna take me down to the station

But I can't complain

Soon as I get bored, I jump on the plane

Nothin' ain't changed

Boy better know a man went to the BRITs on a train

Think it's a game

Man shutdown Wireless, then I walked home in the rain

Then we took it back to Africa

Ask Wizkid, I can't explain

Never knew that I was gonna pop

Pop like 5th of November

Tell the President we ain't forgot

Tell the Prime Minister we still remember

Man don't care what colour or gender

Nobody's votin' for your corrupted agenda

Fix up, look sharp when I enter

And talk with respect when you discuss me

A lot of these MCs disgust me

Real talk, you ain't best MC in the country

And if you don't like it then fuck me

Not literally, but fuck me

How many more MCs do I kill today?

Realize there's nobody above me

I killed every song that I touched

And I turned into MC Hammer, they can't touch me

I be killin' it, over 10 years on the road

That's a permanent mark, they can't smudge me

Teachers used to diss me

Now when I touch the road I make history

Tried to assassinate me, but they missed me

You could never blacklist me

Nah, last year man lost a yute and my heart turned cold

Dem man lost Lukey and my heart just froze

Cause when the cards get closed

I'm like really what's the use of these cars and clothes?

If man don't wanna switch up, I'm a go hard on my own



Cause by now you should know I hate waitin'

I got no patience

Right now man are tryna get out the matrix

Far from the agents

Tryna stay far from the devil in the red dress

Far from the pagans

Gotta stay fighting, gotta stay striving
Gotta stay dreaming, gotta stay believing
Gotta stay scheming
I broke down a few more barricades

Got me a few more accolades

Used to look forward to the weekend

Now every day's like Saturday

Surrounded by stars

Come chill with the constellation

Then she asked me what my real name was

And killed the conversation

Sometimes I've gotta scratch my head

Like big man ting on a level

Only my mum and dad call me Junior

What makes you so special?

No Rolex timepiece

No Hublot kettle

But still I know when it's time to jump in the car

Put the foot to the pedal like



Yeah, I don't care about VIP

I've got very important places to be

While I'm asleep, I'm making a beat

Girls in the house getting naked for me

What I'm tryna say is basically

Never get a joke man mistaken for me

Corn on the curb if a man diss me

My niggas got the biscuits in T

Santa Claus used to miss my house

So I decorated my own Christmas tree

Ring man's phone if he think's it's beef

What do you mean, ""who is this, blud?"" It's me

My niggas been on crime

Don't get it twisted cause I don't beef online

My niggas violent, my niggas loopy

Something you ain't seen on Vine



I don't want a like, I don't want a follow

Diss me today, link me tomorrow

I've got goons that can't leave the country

Above the law, under obbo

I know pain, I know sorrow

I know empty, I know hollow

I just flew my Gs out to Amsterdam

And I told them ""thank me tomorrow""

Cuh man have been in the kitchen

Experimenting with the whipping

And you see, the road ting and the music ain't mixing

Would've thought man was playing baseball

Way man are outside pitching

Never been a punk, never been a victim

Wanna hate on me? Wanna hate on Storm?

Fuck that, let the kings in



I start ringing MCs

Go radio, I start swinging MCs

I was in the trenches, everyday grinding

You couldn't say a man weren't bringing MCs

I will pick up the phone, start ringing MCs

Bars inna my touch, bringing MCs

They know I've got Skeppy on my team

We were on road, living it, skilling MCs

Producers, plus we are living MCs

Bare vibes we have given MCs

I was there back in the day when it was garage

And them man said they wanna get rid of MCs

But them man couldn't get rid of MCs

Cause since then, we've become bigger MCs

Some MC debts

Skibadee, Baseman and Trigga MC



Yeah, us man are blazing powers

Them man are blazing Benson

My bredrin said it's his birthday

Took him onstage with Drake and Section

Hate my niggas cause every day, it's another great invention

Wanna talk about loot? Then I bring the loot out

Talk about shootout? Better be a shootout like a western

Cause I don't fear no man

Think you're a killer but your name ain't Cam

Oi, pussyhole, don't look in my span

Cause you might get shot on the road like 28 gram

And you know who I am

Shower man down like Fireman Sam

Drive to your ends on a two-year ban

With Solo in the transit van

Nah, you can't diss my mum

Shots start fly out and man get bun

Fling on my black garments and dun

Dry skin between my index finger and thumb

I hate man like a nun

That's why I wanna buy a haunted gun

Can't get killed before I get to see my son

Them tings can't run

They got me thirsty for blood again

They got me talking crud again

They got-

Yo, Chip

That's a deeper calling, bro. Like them callings there, it's not everyone's phone that gets that ring ring there, you see what I'm saying, fam? Like super powers fam, super charged, bro

I hear that, fam

Like just being you alone, fam, niggas getting to watch. You're doing what you're supposed to do, bro. Cuh we ain't seen nuttin' like this happen before.

Pulled up in a taxi, text my bredrin, tell him I'm on the strip

I stepped in, went to the bar, made my order

I got my drink, I posted up in the darkest corner

In the cut, jumping around like a little slut

I pulled him up, ""yo, you spilt my Hennessy out my cup""

And still tryna run it up, it's like this guy really wants to scuff

Flexing like he had something on the waist

Pull Shorty out the way, blaow, punch him in the face

Made him Shmoney dance, I made him rock away

We ran out of the dance, we could've got away

But we came back, should've gone home and hit the sack

But he never hit me back, I was like ""that's a wrap"", fuck that

Shorty found some gritty tings to keep us company

Then the feds run up on me and put the cuffs on me

What you know about four man in a cell? Couldn't sleep

Spending pennies in the pissing well

You should see my cell mate, he's in shit as well

Sitting here, just waiting to hear keys in the door

I'm tryna buss this case even if I gotta get on my knees in the court, crazy



Trust me, Decs

Fucking hell, bredda, man

You actually got nicked?

Man, dickhead ting, fighting ting, fam. Look at my knuckle

Fucking hell, what? Strip-searched and?

Before that I'm tryna get the respect

Stepped out in my new creps

Richard Mille's a classic, sapphires, not plastic

Like magnifying glasses, when the light hit it, nigga's ashes

The LaFerrari's a carriage, equipped with more, not baggage

One thousand thirty-five horsepower stallions

The yellow diamonds kept clashin', so we made the rainbow teeth happen

Chanel, Pharrell, it's funny as hell, to my nigga's in heaven just laughin'

So just...

Man get money with the gang

Man get girls with the gang

Man eat food with the gang

Man talk slang to the feds

Can't work out what I just said to a man

Told me you was a big fan but the first thing you said when you saw me is ""Can I get a pic for the gram?""

I was like ""Nah, sorry man""

I only socialize with the crew and the gang



Woah, guess who's back

Came a long way from sittin' in the flats

Came a long way from when whites never used to mix with blacks

Now all my white niggas and my black mates, we got the game on smash

I used to rate your page on MySpace but you never stayed on track

Upset cause your wife is a fan, she done with a little boy

Now she wants to be with a man

Told my accountant ""Do me a transfer, cause I wanna buy some land""

You and I have got different plans

Real mad man, I might go Saint Anne's

No triple A pass, no wristbands

You are not mandem, you are not gang



""Tracksuit Mafia, Boy Better Know

Meridian, bad blocks

London boys, active boys

Tryna hold the mandem down

Cause I shutdown Shoreditch car park

And I got bars like Camden Town

Out there tryna survive on the streets

Tryin' not to get killed by the police

And I be schoolin' MC's

Nobody leaves 'til half-past-three

This year I'mma teach them a lesson

Tell Grace don't reply to those emails

Nah, I don't wanna do no sessions

It's like them man have got an obsession with my style of expression

But in public, never hear my name mentioned

Catch them at the nightclub entrance

Always seekin' attention

But I be inside, tryna get burst

Lookin' all cool like Herc

Dressed like I just come from P.E

You're dressed like you just come from church

Better do your research

You don't wanna hear my verse come after your verse

MCs act brand new cause they got a little money in their purse

So you had a good solo career?

Had a few big songs over the years?

Back then you was a real Top Boy

But right now fam, nobody cares

Walked in the club, everybody's like

""Who is he? Why is he walkin' around with security?""

You know the postcode when you're talkin' road

Better know that I speak that fluently



I don't know why man's callin' me family all of a sudden

God knows I don't wanna go prison

And if Selassie saw you he would say

""Blud take off the red gold and green""

Them man are soft just like ice cream

If you don't wanna upset me, you get me?

You tryna show me your Fendi

I'm in a different class

When I get through I'mma bring my dargs

2 by 2, man a walk on the ark

Sittin' at the front, just like Rosa Parks

Trust me, you don't wanna see me get dark

Upset cause man are way up right now

And the shit happened all so fast

I was in Paris, shut down l'Arc

New York, shut down Central Park

Talk about London, yo Frisco where shall I start?

Walked in, spat ten 16 bars

And each and every one of them came from the heart

None of my lyrics are stolen

""Go on then, go on then"", that's my slogan

Wanna know how I did it with no label

No A-list songs, and I told them

It's the return of the mack

I'm still alive just like 2Pac

Girls in the front row, girls in the back

Spit one lyric everybody's like brap

Flashback to the cold nights in the trap

Now I'm in a new whip counting the big stack

Yellow-gold chains and the diamonds are black

Jack me? Nah you don't wanna do that

Anytime you see me wearing a glove

Boy Better Know I ain't coming to fight like Jet Li

Spray this till the clip is empty

I know you get what I'm saying, get me?

But no, badboy I've been one of those

Wake up call, you will get one of those

One to the eyeball, one to the nose

I don't really care about your postcode

Take your girl, no dinner no rose

Two minutes in my bedroom, no clothes

Girls everywhere, girls in the club

Looking at me, tryna make a black man blush

Girls on the high street, girls on the bus

But these niggas wanna hang around us, that's sus

I don't wanna see a Stone Island, cuz

Man talk shit, I just smile and flush

I'm looking for a girl with an X factor

But I don't judge like Simon does



From day one I said I was serious

Then ""Serious"" hit the jackpot

People ask what music I make

Turn the volume up cuz, that's what

I don't wear no bait designer brands

I spit deep bars in my black top

You'll never see me smoking a cigarette

Cah cigarette smoker that's not me

Nah, that's not me

Nah, that's not

When I'm on the mic in a rave

I got the whole crowd bubbling like a crack pot

See me and Skepta in a video, with a nostalgic backdrop

There'll never be a day when I don't make music

Cause silent? Nah that's not me



Nah, that's not me

In the studio, run out of drink, all we got is some weed and biscuits

I'm supposed to be writing

Instead I'm daydreaming about doggy-styling Kate Winslet

Snap out of the dream

Pass me the lighter let me light up the green

A million words in my head

Tryna think about punchlines that I haven't already said

I wanna write a diss track but my enemies are already dead

I only smoke one spliff but my eyes are already red

I'll be waiting 'til the cows come home

For man to offer me a biscuit cos I don't normally beg

Open up the pizza box we got earlier but it's full of crust and corn

We've been here so long

I just heard the speakers yawn

I go hard like Jason Bourne

These other MC's remind me of Mr. Bean and Johnny English reborn

But I still beep my horn

Screamin' team UK

'Cause that's where I made my name

That's where I made my change

That's where I fucked up them pussyholes when they tried to pop my chain

Nothing but true facts that I speak on the track

Real niggas know where the real niggas at

I'm a good youth but I will fight back

Out to the mixed-race, white and black

Fake G's all over the place

Before you put it on me you better put something over your face

'Cause I won't snitch I'll tell the officer I don't wanna press no charges

I'm closing the case

Discharge myself from the hospital

Fuck the constable

Go home and deal with the beef like sunday roast on a plate

See I grew up in London

Where the olders talk, but the youngers ain't listening

I was given dirty looks by the priest at my christening

No food in the kitchen

Two brothers, one sister'n

Right now you're listening to the oldest sibling

And I get so much cake I might change my surname to Kipling

All the mandem raise your glasses again

Here's to another year at the top of the game

Ah we just can't stop toasting

Said I'll be a big MC by end of school term and they thought I was joking

Now I got 15 girls in my bed and each and every one of them's roasting

But up next, The Honeymoon starring UK MC Skepta. This film contains graphic scene of nudity, drugs and violence. Please switch off now if you feel you're going to be offended. Listeners discretion is advised
[Verse 1]
I've been keeping my ear to the streets
The UK run out of ideas
Everybody doing covers of American beats

If it ain't the Ace Hood ""Hustle Hard"" flow

Then it all sounds like Rick Ross to me

This is the shit I'm supposed to respect?

Fuck that nigga SMD

P A U S to the E

Dunno who you're pretending to be

I don't care what gun you bang

I don't care what drug you sell

Fuck you man

Because I got a manager, a DJ

7 MC's and five producers on my label

So before you start eating food in the game

Better bring something to the table



[Hook]

Too many man come in the game for two minutes

Shoot two videos, spit two lyrics

Now all of a sudden their names getting mentioned

In the same sentence as mine by the critics

What has this world come to

Man better control Z and undo

But all thanks to the love and support

I'm gassed up standing out the sun roof

And I'm screaming BBK BBK

None of them flex like BBK

And if I ever see your girl on the street

Then I'mma get arrested for TDA

Cause she knows I do it and it's real

And I don't give a shit who's got a deal

Cause if the game was a tray full of ice cubes

I'm the coldest and the hardest still



[Verse 2]

They thought the ""All Over The House"" video would crush me

Last week I did five shows in five different countries

The supports have still got love for me

Middle finger to the media

Hypocrites can't touch me

I'll be in Dubai eating in Nobu

Word to Dumi and T this food tastes lovely

I walk from White Hart lane to the flats opposite Tottenham police station

Payed subs to go on the radio station

Left radio jumped on the train to Leytonstone

Linked Murkle Man to make some more grime in the basement

Lemme show you bout dedication

Suffering from Underdog Psychosis tryna stay alive

Riding around on a bike

Blade long enough to go to jail for, more dots on me than a dice

The olders had the chips and the big macs

But didn't wanna let me have a bite

So it was just me, my cats and the foxes roaming the streets at night

Felt like I was wasting life

Put down the cling film and picked up the mic

For one whole year never got music money or money off white

But I know that Rome weren't built in a day

Looked at he end of the tunnel and saw light

Now me and Jme, top 30, back to back on the iTunes site, mental



[Hook]

Too many man come in the game for two minutes

Shoot two videos, spit two lyrics

Now all of a sudden their names getting mentioned

In the same sentence as mine by the critics

What has this world come to

Man better control Z and undo

But all thanks to the love and support

I'm gassed up standing out the sun roof

And I'm screaming BBK BBK

None of them flex like BBK

And if I ever see your girl on the street

Then I'mma get arrested for TDA

Cause she knows I do it and it's real

And I don't give a shit who's got a deal

Cause if the game was a tray full of ice cubes

I'm the coldest and the hardest still"

It's the simple life that I'm dreaming of
No more sleepless nights looking for the way to survive
But I simply can't afford to change it up, change it up

No more sleepless nights looking for the way to survive

But I simply can't afford to change it up, change it up (listen)



Yeah, when I came in the game I kept my eyes wide open like fish in the sea

I'm done smiling with people I don't like in places I don't wanna be

She told me it's just a little bit of powder so I look better in HD

I saw the video, I had so much make-up I didn't even look like me

So now it's just me, myself and the camera, 1080p

She saw the video fullscreen on YouTube, now she wants to fuck with a G

Told me she'd come into my house in a long coat with nothing underneath

I would love you more if you brought me a packet of Rizla and something to eat

Please, keep it simple don't act like a leech

I don't wanna hear your ""I'm not a groupie, tell me your real name"" speech

My real name is Skepta and I do this for my niggas that breach

I do this for the girl with green eyes sunbathing topless on a beach

I tell an A&R come check me if you wanna talk about making an anthem

You wanna talk label politics, go and check David Cameron

'Cause if success is judged by chart positions and riches

I'll put the mic down and leave my legacy to reign on all these bitches



I love you so much sometimes I can't breathe

But I still find that standing here watching you leave

I know you want excitement and life on the edge

And I lived like that for so long that it fucked with my head

It's the simple life that I'm dreaming of

It's the simple life that I'm dreaming of

No more sleepless nights looking for the way to survive

But I simply can't afford to change it up, change it up"

If I had the same myspace views as you
If I saw Skepta go from sitting on the wall
To sitting in a white V6 Coop
I think I'm the best and I call it competitve confidence
Not Vanity

It's not my fault them man have got a childish mentality

And they don't know how to make a tune for the mainstream radio road man

And the stageshow at the same time

Watch what too many man and sunglasses at night do in two double o nine

Let me tell you why I'm the king of grime

You write a hundred million different flows

I write that classical line to last me my whole life time



[Chorus]



I wouldn't like me either

If I had a flow like yours that left no space for a breather

Then Skepta comes around

With a flow that breaks down

More times then a P reg Vauxhall Tiva

Too book Skepta ain't getting no cheaper

But promoters still want me to feature

Your sitting at home telling yourself the shit weed your smoking is a creeper

It's not creeping

Stop lying to yourself fam you might as well have bought Sisha

I'm too real nobody realer

Too deep nobody deeper

Flow like gus will nigger street sweeper



[Chorus]



Wouldn't even come out their yard

About victim

You think I rap way too fast and your thinking this grime thing ain't the in ting

But you know what I hear that killer

But don't mistake me for that nigger

I get mad when I think this ting's got me spitting with people like Boya and Saskilla

Look right

It's not what it looks like

I stay with gang live a good life

I used to shot grams on a push bike

But I wern't a brand name like suk knight

I took time I kept a low profile I had the food that make that cats go wild

Before music I had a booming line

[Verse 1:]
Always Ready

The black Nigerian's way to heavy

Every time I open my mouth blud

I say a lyric and another MC gets buried

Yeah 6 feet under

Leave a whole in your jumper

When the big skeng rings out like a private number

Ring Ring talk to answer machine

Yo Frisco pass the machine

I just wanna do my part for the scene

I'm a big man but they wanna see me act like I'm 15

Na fam it's a big man ting so please stop watching the whip man's in

I don't wanna be no funky house DJ

But they got me on a wig man ting



[Chorus:]

You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man

You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man

You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man

You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man

I seen so much now I don't give a monkeys

Swing from tree to tree just like monkeys



[Verse 2:]

So man wanna war me

Record me

Lights camera action

Who produces anthem after anthem

(Me) Skepta the microphone champion

Some people can't see you will never win a lyrical war with me

So I'm gonna call this one lord of the mics part 3

And murder another 25 MC's

So dig me a larger grave

Spray my ting like aftershave

It's gonna be a par today

When your heart beat stops and you pass away

Trust me it's all easy to me

I'm champagne your lambrini to me

Dunno why your talking greezy to me

When I'm Rodney Price your Beeny to me



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

They wanna run it up

But like armour said

It's nothing leave them

Bare skeng talk I can't believe them

Red and white r6 I'll leave them

Ed Hardy glasses I can't see them

So why you talking like you can't die

One bullet in each lung breath then

See your sounding weezy

And I heard your CD

You and your mandem are talking greezy

I just tell a man like D-E-E

Come On Come On

Do you really think if I give 2 shits if your greezy

I don't think so

You man ain't seen greezy yet

All my mandem pop it off

Your man will fly off into the sky like easyjet

I've been in here since half past ten

It's half past two now when's all this gonna end

I only had one phonecall so I used it

To call my best friend

I told him get all the stuff out the house

Before the po po come searching the prem

The fed keeps looking at me through the flap

Blad, go check somebody else

He took my shoelaces n took my belt

Look we both know there's no way I can hang myself

One minute I saw blue lights

The next minute I'm getting read my rights

Officer the cuffs are way too tight

Your taking the piss out my life

It's a hypppeee

When I woke up this morning

I never thought I'd be sitting in a cell

On a blue mat no blanket yawning

Hoping that I get bail

But then I got shift like oh my days

Now I'm sitting in the cell like oh my gosh

Chat about next man I can't hear or see

Never talk on behalf of my co - d

And I don't want a quiet word with a PC

I don't wanna cigarette no I don't smoke

And I definatly don't wanna bust no joke

I know blacks but I don't know brown

You wanna say sotum say it when you see me. Don't phone me save your credit cause if you can't tell me what happens after you die I don't wanna hear it(NO). You ain't half a gangster nowhere near it.

Meridian that's my murdering force. Giggs beat the sken in south I heard it in North and to hate we got Boy Better Know t-shirts and SN1 wear for the whole world to endorse course.

Norths up in this bitch, I don't know what you heard but you can't take the piss. If you saw what the kick back done to my wrist you would have never put my name on your murder list.

Fam if you interrupt the vibe that I'm in then I ride ride ride with my ting. So fuck them niggers everyday I'm surrounded by killers like I was on a lifers wing.

See I'm a cool brudda with a heart of the wickedest, violate me I squeeze this till it finishes. Then I switch cliques like Hollowman switches chicks.

Then I turn you round pick you up so you can see my name, I'm looking in your eyes so deep I think I see your brain.

Your sexy voice sounds sweet to the ear like a song Bob Marley sang, I wanna throw you in a ring give you a body drop and a power slam.

It's not a joke

No eddy murphy raw

You mustve been smokin on the p4

Cause if you ever saw what we saw

You wouldn't look me up and down like a see-saw

Check it out AZZI

Test it out solo

Test it out KJ

Test it out

I know it's working proper now

So it's not a joke when I take it out

Pull it out, shot one of my eyes and press it out

No practice,

But everytime I spit a verse on adlib

My names on everybodys lips like chapstick

Me d and p stick

With the metal like a magnet it's a madness

You could call me bumpy (cause I bump ps)

And I get my knock on like rugby

And my swaggers insane your dusty

You lot are dutty

You dress all the same

Skepta ed-hardy all the way

You see dubz and christian augdigier

I'm on the block where the ballers stay

Your at home watching porn you're gay

I let the champagne pour

Your gang make money but my gang make more

That's why were on a champagne tour

Definatly wouldn't be looking at me

Fresh to the feet you can see designer socks

Buy gucci kreps these niggas buy shocks

My papes long like big H locks

Yeah you know a nigga topnotch

When I draw for the skeng sheet when the got cops

These niggas call crimestoppers

No days off we full time shotters

You See the 4 best crews in the game I'm in dem, if you don't like me do something then, 10 minute screw faces I ain't in them, I want paper dibi dibi wages I ent them, My crew put 5 A? 20 notes in a roulette mechine and spin dem, anybody get rude al clench ma fist and chin dem, Forget a mash, Forget a clash, their trash al bin dem I don't wanna lyrical swing I will physicly swing dem, that's why I haven't clashed anybody since long son den some win seng, If I hear mans say my name al ring them, if I hear any skeng talk on ma 33 10 al find out where they are and link dem, Headlock powerdrive and pin dem.
More, more, more money more paper more, more money more paper I wanna see more dough then a baker run tings like ninja man and cartelli in jamaica, promoters pay me nuff paper, you know me man, the only man who could ever give me a bill is a waiter, Skepta heavy, heavy like pacer, I like the way things are going now I gotta start collecting the dough in, I used to only get bookings in the uk now me and my crews boarding the 747 bowing, I gotta get that dollar get that euro get that yen come back to england fit that again, I repeat fit that again!

I Work Hard everyday, I won't stop grime until everythings kosher, Until I got the house on the hill that looks like the one on the holiday brochure, I want power but it can't be solar, I'v always wanted to be a high roller, When I was young I had to get nikey I couldn't get gola, I had name brands when I was on ma stroller, I'm a big man now so wanna bow tie and a bowler, Forget P's like diddy I wanna make p's just like coca cola, For the big house in Angola, and the big Range Rover, And the P's legit so it realy don't matter if police wanna come an try pull man over"
