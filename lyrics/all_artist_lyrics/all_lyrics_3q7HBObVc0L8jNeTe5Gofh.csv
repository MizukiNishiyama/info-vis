Rich as a motherfucker, and ain't much changed
Open my eyes, no suprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I don't want the jit
I'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget

The true principles of life are supply and demand

Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand

My man got knowledge of self, at my back God

Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off

My temper volatile, grew up a violent child

Fuck a boy scout, I air your ass out

Nigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck

Shoot a couple head cracks, leave wipe you up

I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage

Gold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics



We came from nothing, now they saying we straight

Nigga, hold up, hold on

Hold on

These niggas, they watching every dime we make

Hold up, hold on

Hold on



We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view

Instead we get the D's in the rear view

We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played

And so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed

It's not a big deal to me, stay calm

I'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds

But, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done

Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one

Used to do graffiti, now look we major

Don't make me write my name across your face with a razor

Re-Up, new joke, they say this sample the bomb

This shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one

Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency

No lactose involved, pure propo leaf

You can sniff that or cook that to my belief

That money coming in like we run the streets



We came from nothing, now they saying we straight

Nigga, hold up, hold on

Hold on

These niggas, they watching every dime we make

Hold up, hold on

Hold on



This shit go how I said, go when it's time to expand

So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan

You a gangster for real, you ready to ride?

Nigga, you gonna die a bad case of too much pride

Check my DNA, homie I'm a different kind

Hit the speed dial, that quick I'll get ya lined

Won't won't your block, just cop your work from us

Those niggas you call allies can't be trust

That Rollie all gold, I got the Midas touch

Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff

On the phone I heard 'Ye smacked the shit outta a kid

Now Jimmy got life, gonna smack him again

When it's war, it'll be war to the very end

If they ever say we lose, I start it again

Let's sneak the niggas spray that Semi at your momma crib

With a silencer we couldn't even hear that shit



We came from nothing, now they saying we straight

Nigga, hold up, hold on

Hold on

These niggas, they watching every dime we make

Hold up, hold on

Hold on"

I say say no to drugs then I do that shit

Got a blue fleet of whips

See my blood on these diamonds everything proper

Your shit look grown and your shit look copper

It's turning homie that's why your turning on me

Admit it I made it, I can't be faded

Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks

Got them straps and long clips filled up with led

So when we count on the paper it better come back correct

We out in New Orleans baby niggas hungry for brick

I do that knife for stuntin get shot in the head

Every hood I go through they fuck with me you dig?

Got the eye of the tiger I'm on that animal shit

I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant

Damn scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything

It's the unit my nigga, take a look at my face

See if you test me they'll arrest me I'll be catching a case

New York is a concrete jungle, where niggas got to get paid

Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed

Look at me wrong and your dead

You should be very afraid

I don't know how to behave

I'm tamed fresh out the cage

Urrrrrrrhhhh

Blue sapphires on days when she feeling Hoover

She hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood

Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it

I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample

That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb

She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burning, we smoking

My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing

She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around

In the small of my back in case some shit go down

Right under my Hermes, I'm hearing the word is

Oh lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs

She like the stones in my cross, she flawless

I'm thinking damn, why would God give one woman all this?

You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me

It's complicated, my occupation pimping ain't easy

Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks

Back when I was pumping crack, now my cards are black

Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs

If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs

Luther said it: a house is not a home without her

I had them panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder

But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits

Her wanting is temporary cause for sure she gon' get it

Skyscraper paper, baby, life in a limelight

Want the best of the best, the top of the top

I mean the baddest bitch, you know, the cream of the crop

We gotta hustle and have it, we better than average

More like the elite, my nigga, we gotta eat



Get the party rockin', bottles poppin'

Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, twisted, twisted

Yeah, yeah, yeah

System thumpin', the club is jumpin'

Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, twisted, twisted

Yeah, yeah, yeah



What was once a strike against us has become an advantage

Cause we grind when we at it like we stone-cold addicts

That mastermind, that mental is oh so essential

Product of the environment, they ain't been what we've been through

I'm fond of the phrase If there's a will, there's a way

Cause we come from the parts where only killas could play

Southside, it's alright, ghetto's my Alma Mater huh? It's alright

We could keep the party jumpin' like this all night

The bottles, just keep em coming, baby, let's get right

Let's get it on, play a little Marvin

It's gettin' hot in here, homie, this could be a problem

[?] let's keep riding to the top

Let's do it, do it big and let the fuckin' haters watch, oh yeah

This is perfect, this a moment to remember

As we proceed on our money getting agenda



Get the party rockin', bottles poppin'

Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, twisted, twisted

Yeah, yeah, yeah

System thumpin', the club is jumpin'

Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, twisted, twisted

Yeah, yeah, yeah"

Still pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick

We still mob, niggas steal stuff

We still deal after deal, shit is no problem

He still love her, she ain't shit

Get her a pair of Louboutins, she suck a dick

Still real niggas, still will kill

Told the still bitch don't squeal, get your cap peeled

The Mac filled, black talons, hollow tips

See I'm a gangsta, you soft as R&B singers

I'm at a war with the banger, in the club with the shanker

Mask on, lone ranger, scope on the K, lone ranger

Rather be alive and rich than die and be famous

Live my life in the fast lane, I crash into anything

I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sing

Rims on, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out of you, nigga

Trying to pull out your pistol when you know that you're lame

You chasing these bitches instead of chasing your paper

Niggas taking your bitches while they taking your paper

Pitbull in a skirt, yeah, I'm a magnet

Now I ain't running after no broads, she stuck on my dick

I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes

Money in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green

She's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why

Never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind

Pretty nigga with a gorgeous gun

You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look

There ain't a bitch more dime than me

The thirst is real, she knocking over drinks to get next to me

Ghetto niggas still'll pick a penny up

You outside chasing them hoes throwing your Henny up

Little homie loading a semi up

Catch him all after the club, tell him to ante up

Anyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way

You owe me, you better pay

Ghost, let the beretta spray

Hood want uncut dope and some better yay

I ain't chasing pussy, never have

Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass

I make it so HOT! - One shot'll melt your ass!

GOT POPPED UP! - Probably till my eyes turned red

Told myself in the mirror nigga you ain't dead!

I'm far from eccentric, I'm so PSYCHOTIC

I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I GOT IT!

When you see me in the hood - muhfucker don't talk to me!

'Less you wan' talk about usin' a Hawk for me.

When Al blew Black away I had 'em on some stupid shit

Then my rap shit WORKED! - Now I'm super stupid rich!

All I do is stunt now! - I'm so Maybach!

There I go frontin' again I meant to say laid back!

GO 'HEAD! Move wreckless get banged for necklace

I serve 'em with the Semi feed 'em a clip for breakfast.



[Chorus:]

You want some? - Come get some!

Nigga it's murder one, when I toss my gun!

You might see me let it off, you might see me run!

But you won't see shit time the police come! - Huh?

You want a ace on purpose? ! - Why you so nervous?

Nigga we from the same hood! - We come from the same shit!

You got gonorrhea too, we fucked with the same bitch!

Gettin' money is necessary so me I'm a visionary!

And I'm sayin' that house - should be a crackhouse!

Now see it how I see it; or I bring the Straps out!

The Tec and the Mack out! - The Sig and the Taurus!

The Coke and that Heckler - then nigga we warin'!

I let my pistol speak for me and all of 'em foreign.

Click-clack! - Comprende? I'm criminal minded!

Toss money in the sewer! - Bet nobody find it!

Till it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun! - What?

Leave me aloneee..
I ain' fuckin' with nobody..

Keep fuckin' with me you gon' turn me back to Boo Boo

Have me casin' out your crib, tryna pop your fuckin' noodles

She was twenty I was twelve, man my Nana said she raped me

I jus' smiled from ear to ear, sayin' take me baby take me

Since high school, nigga I ain't got no friends

Got two Three-Eighty's like the Ying Yang Twinz, Ahh..

That's spot clickin' till the D's run in

Then it's bail money and lawyer fees you got to have ends

Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane

In a ill Herringbone I got 'um swingin' Heroine

I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump

Then you can run Forrest run retard when I dump

They take kindness for weakness, niggaz don't respect that

So me I'm where that Reuger, that Pump and that Tech at

Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then

Shit man, but you had like, twenty bricks in Richmond

We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreamin'

We jus' got in the town, we was strapped up schemin'

First Country caught a body, then country caught a body then

I popped a couple niggaz, then country shot everybody

It's cold blooded, it's real shit you got to love it

Tre-Eight Snub it, and don't think nuttin' of it

It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move

Get it poppin' when we shoppin' niggaz hold down the two's..



[Chorus]

I seen niggaz gettin' rich..

Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by..

I was tired of havin' shit..

Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by..

I seen niggaz gettin' hit..

Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by..

We was slingin' that shit..

Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by..

Here I am..



[Verse]

Yeah..

I was ?? since we was little niggaz son since we were seven

Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven

Niggaz popped his whip up, hit his can we were seven

He a lucky muhfucker I bet he make it to heaven

My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk

My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fuckin' stash up

I had two-hundred and fifty grams stashed on the porch

I mean I'm what you call smoke man, I'm what you call snort

First the VCR went, then the tv went

He stole outta mommy purse, she thought it was me kid

I ain' ask her for no money son cause I was out hustlin'

She was lookin' at me sideways like I'm a thief or somethin'

That hurt me, c'mon son that wouldn't hurt you

I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple

I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge

The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub..



[Bridge]

The Lord don't have imperfections baby..

So I think I'm perfect the way he made me..

Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy..

Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazin'..

I seen niggaz gettin' rich..

Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by..

I was tired of havin' shit..

Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by..

I seen niggaz gettin' hit..

Now you can watch me! - Nigga like the police watch me!

I move proper! - Go ahead catch a shell tryna stop me!

That 4-30 Spider, carbon fibre

And my dog is like al qaeda natural fighter!

Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider,

The Mack'll fire, mask like Michael Myers!

It's off the wire! - When I get on my bullshit

No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass!

You can explain to my niggas while they whoop yo' ass

Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid!

They say first comes love, then comes marriage

Instead I got Shanequa in a baby carriage

Then came the cash then the baby mama drama

I gave that bitch a half a mill she blew it on Prada

I remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada

Got my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit

Man I can't even flaunt shit cause everybody want shit

Everybody mad, DAMN even my dad

And I don't even know him now how the fuck I owe him?!

I ain't given nobody shit I'm a show them

I gave Game hits and told me to suck dick

Start screamin Westside and Dre ain't say shit!!!

Now we just eat off him, and when I talk to Em

A smile comes on his face, he told me here's the case

Enemies stay enemies but friends they change

I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry

Look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me, I'll get to you

A clip or two'll cripple you, just 'cause I ain't got shit to do

Pistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop

Eenie meenie miney moe, now tre pound or 44

Pick a strap to take the mag. The hawk I'll stab it in your back

I'll blow your brains, I know your name

And where you rest, I'll make a mess

The holla tips'll hit ya chest, you cough up blood to EMS

Come pick you up, You know you fucked 

When you get on a stretcher

'cause I'll come in ta ICU, to see you off to heaven

The system I done been through. If there's nothing you did to me

They locked me up they let me out, you seen this in the movies

The criminals be criminals, why they up in corrections?

They come on get a 9, nigga me grind to perfection

It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistics

But they can't find a fingerprint this shit's going terrific

He's so close to your target that it's really hard to miss it

The can of whoop ass with the Shady Aftermath lid

You pop off the top it's like opening vats of acid

Beat the Octamom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid

Attack a snatch, yeah there's something to jack a batch in

Impregnate her then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac 10s

Triplets, quadruplets and a couple of back to back twins

Dead fetuses fallin out all over, Jack is back again

The Rippers at your service, girl I can see that your nervous

But I barely scratch the surface, like my last batch of girlfriends

That I buried in my fuckin backyard. Still trying to dig their way out

I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out

It's past your curfew when its dark, I'm searchin for you in the park

Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark

He met his quota for the month. They found Dakota all rolled up

Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block

Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop

Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops

CSI they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props

The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter top.

I'm as ill as can be

My appeal is to serial killers, what a pill is to me,

Killing so villainously,

Still as maniacal on the Nyquil and psycho as Michael Myers,

And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers.

Truly ours Julia, you better learn learn.

I'm debating, mutilating the lady,

You've been waiting for shady 

And Fif. Ain't no duplicating it baby,

There's a baby in the drive, there's a torso in the washer,

I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her,

Arms and legs in the garbage cos the rest of her, I lost her,

Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her,

And put her through the ringer and hung her over the wash tub.



[50 Cent]

When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that'll cough up

A hard rock, a soft fuck

Get caught up and get washed up,

In Detroit or Northfolk,

Look deep in my eyes, see Many Many Men die,

I swing gym stars faster than Samurai.

You think about money when you think about me huh,
Thats why my ex's my ex you don't want to be her,
She used to have the beemer, now she own a sneaker,
I had her eating lobster now she eating pizza,
I think about easter when I think about Keyshia,

Shorty stay fly thats why I keep her,

Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa,

She good if I leave her she got her own visa,

Think about them when you about frontin

Think about stuntin when you think about me,

Im the boss bentley or the porsche,

Overseas jet skis slide across,

I love the way you dress,

Now take it off,

Put your legs high on my shoulders across,

Im racing through your mind but you already lost,

Im at the finish line and your the friend of mine,

Come on lets ride

Fell in love with a b-tch walked away with one leg,

She aint even have to run to get away with the bread,

Thats some f-cked up sh-t

Think about that kid,

Im thinking what this b-tch thinking when she take me to court,

I pay my child support, what the f-ck she want,

This relationship, shit its too much for me,

I wanna f-ck your friends and live comfortably

She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees,

She should have what she wants just not for me,

Im thinking bout my future she part of my past,

She don't care bout me she just want some cash,

Im thinking damn girl, we used to be friends,

How did sh-t become all about m's

I'm smelling my sh-t too now how you like that,

You coulda had this dude and anything you choose,

And that girl you lose cause I ain't f-cking with ya,

Coulda been you, living lavish,

Instead it's your girlfriend,

But you tripping while we sipping,

In the back of a big...

You were supposed to be sure baby, you was confused,

I had a thang for ya, I had a ride for ya,

House, cars, kids and a pet name for ya,

P-ssy cat, I told you I'll make it you ain't believe,

I guess coming up it was hard, it was easy to leave,

I think about it maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong,

Either way shorty life goes on,

When your around my smiles a grin,

My thoughts are a sin,

You asked can we try again,

I ain't f-cking with you,

It's on the club jumpin,

I'm tryna to get my liquor in

You want sometin ? again

I'm staring at your thicker friend,

I guess I'm like Will Smith in the Pursuit of Happyness,

In my hood we all hustle in pursuit of the same sh-t,

Just think just think, that coulda been you,

Just think, that shoulda been you,

Yeah, with me I share the world with you,

But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't f-cking with you,

There ain't no other way to put it except,

I know you'll understand girl it's...

And it coulda been you but no

Said it coulda been

[VERSE 3]

My lawyers all contained cuz every month I give them stacks

Them pigs want a semi if theirs a murder like macks

Man I wasnt the shooter I was never on the sceene

So if they do phroenzics then they will know it wasnt me

Theres no need for a lie dictor cuz I aint sayin shit

The more you talk the higher your chance is your doin a bid

Today I read the paper and it said tru life caught a case

They said they found the victum with a knife stuck in his face

I spoke it michael vick and I told him I'm happy he home

You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on

When dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck

So you can back and shake it on the feild and show them whats up



[CHORUS]

I'm on flight 187

[50 Cent]

See I come from the Southside where niggaz is outside

Right now with the rubber grips

Niggaz say they gon' see me, to hit 'em on G.P.

Then I bless 'em with the chains full of bricks

When you come from where I'm from, you come from the bottom

They ain't supposed to get this rich

So the Fed's got my phone tapped to treat me like Fat Cat

Now I'm thinkin ""Man ain't this a bitch!""

Niggaz stick cola in cola, from movin the yola

Next thing you know they up in yo' crib

Sayin where's the stash at? You move they gon' blast that

So I suggest you stand still kid

In her fantasy, there's plain to see

Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking

All into my set sheets

When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll

I'll be in this bitch till the club close

What should I do, one thing on all fours

Now that that shit should be against the law

From side to side, let the ride, break it down (down down)

You know I like, when you hike and you throw it all around

Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move

Girl you got me thinking about, all the things I do to you

Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions

From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

When I'm out in L.A. boy it's wraps and swishes
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this

Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit



[Verse 1:]

I'm in my Lambo maggot, my fo' fo' faggot

Doors lift up I'm like Go Go Gadget

See the shit I got on, homey I hate too

My Teflon arm brought my government issues

I'll hit your vertebrate bullets rip through tissues

Your wife on the futon hugging that shitsu

Homey you a bitch you got feminine ways

Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days

I got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's

And got more whips than a runaway slave

Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades

When I made fifty mill, Em got paid

When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid

When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid

I ain't even gotta rap now life is made

Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy mayne



[Chorus:]

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughing



[Verse 2:]

I see nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll

I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold

Got it off the street moving bundles and loads

Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll

Breeze pass with the EZ Pass fuck the toll

No more platinum I'm wearing gold

I'm internationally known as the kid with the flow

That brings enough dough it's never enough dough

Shit I need mo' I need shit out the sto'

Baby ble was cold fresh out the flo'

Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war

Make the purple bring the green in fuck the law

I'm oh so raw, I'm hot I'm sure

I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe boy

I set the club on fire I told ya

I'm the general salute me soldier



[Chorus:]

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughing



[Outro:]

Now work it out now, shorty work it out, work it out

I wanna see you, break it down

Now back it up now, you know what I'm about

It's like a bank job I'm renting them out

Now work it out now, work it out, work it out

Now work it out now, work it out, work it out"

Niggas screw they face up at me
On some real shit son, they don't want beef
I cock that, aim that shit out the window
Spray, there ain't a shell left in my heat
Ya'll niggas better lay down, yeah I mean stay down

Get hit with a K round, ya ass ain't gon' make it

You niggas gon' get layed out in blood and ya brains out

Have you on the concrete, shiverin' and shakin'

I'm from Southside mothafucka, where the gats explode

If you feel like you on fire, boy drop and roll

niggas'll heat ya ass up cause they heart turns cold

Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load

The party jump, with shorty bouncin' that ass

I won't fuck, gimme a second, I'ma holla, I'ma see whats up

I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in my trunk

Carve ya ass up nice, you play me like a punk



[Chorus]

In my hood

niggas got love for me, but I don't go no where without my strap

In my hood

A lil dro', a lil hennessy, a nigga just don't know how to act

In my hood

niggas is grimey, I stay on point, I move with my gat

In my hood

niggas might buck at me, so I keep somethin' around to buck back

In my hood



[Verse 2]

I don't trust a mothafuckin' soul when the D's come they fool

On my first case they told, where I'm from it ain't safe

To have more than a 8th, niggas'll come to your place

Put a gun in your face, tell ya open the safe

As your heart starts to race cause a robbery could turn into a homo-case

Co-opperate or Doc will have to op-porate, niggas will pop at you

Run the light, then pop at Jake, trust me son, niggas will go hard for that cake

These thirsty niggas will lurk, then you'll have to catch 'em and murk 'em

I'm observin' in my hood, these niggas be dumbin'

Shots go off at the dice game, all you see is 'em runnin'

They make it harder and harder to pump on the block

I'm a hustler, how the fuck I'm supposed to eat when its hot



[Chorus]

In my hood

niggas got love for me, but I don't go no where without my strap

In my hood

A lil dro', a lil hennessy, a nigga just don't know how to act

In my hood

niggas is grimey, I stay on point, I move with my gat

In my hood

niggas might buck at me, so I keep somethin' around to buck back

In my hood



[Verse 3]

That house party off the hook, until the shots go off

Well thats what you get for stuntin' on my block show off

Uhh you shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin'

Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin'

Shorty down there, on the Queens track takin' a whippin'

Shit, bitch get out a pocket, she needs some discipline

Peep the fiends, shootin' diesel in his arm in the alley

Look at the chrome spinners spinnin' on that black DeNalli

The grimey niggas where I'm from, they wanna see you chipped up

You shine, they gon' ?? and shoot your whip up

It ain't good to do good in my hood [Gunshot]

You know not to do good now



[Chorus]

In my hood

niggas got love for me, but I don't go no where without my strap

In my hood

A lil dro', a lil hennessy, a nigga just don't know how to act

In my hood

niggas is grimey, I stay on point, I move with my gat

In my hood

niggas might buck at me, so I keep somethin' around to buck back

I got a hit ya, its ya trigger finger, nigga its a killa in me not to spray that shit

I got enough ammo shots to blow I up a hole in every mothafucka out this bitch

I unload then reload, when you get hit I supposed you gon' be strong enough to take this shit

I'm in the hood ridin' round with a chrome fo' pound, can you see thru the windows see tints

Man I gotta have shoes, you know chrome 22's, everytime I get a brand new whip

I rolled around in a 5, till my money ???, then I went back and got that six

I'm in a big white Benz, on a hot sunny day, I call up the milk truck and shit

I have ya hoe, eyeballin' at the light, damn pimpin', you should take time to check that bitch

You saw me ridin through the hood, actin' like its all good, but I'm lookin' for a ??? and shit

And a nigga with a knife, you can turn on ya lights, I mean my niggas in ya crib

Got the macs, got the nines, got them tecks all the time, holo-tips and the extra clips

Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over I won't hesitate to pop or shank ya

Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over you don't listen you gon' get ya ass hit

Ahh man
You know where the niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em

All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'

I'm supposed to die tonight

niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay

I'm down to ride tonight

We rollin, whip stolen, AK loaded

I'm down to ride tonight

We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded

Somebody gon' die tonight



[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]

This is nothin' new, I been in the position before

Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door

Different day, same shit, old mac, new clip

Thirty two hollow tips, gloves, no rubber grip

I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect

I catch 'em slippin', I have 'em tongue kissin' my tec

Wanna come test me, pussy boy don't try

Police responds, never fast enough, the shots fired

Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' wit son

'Fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done

Its elementary, life is but a dream

You know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream

After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit

You took that paper, you take a life or ya life get took bitch

Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle

Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'

I'm supposed to die tonight

I'm down to ride tonight

We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded

Somebody gon' die tonight



[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]

In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish

I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit

Big said damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

And pray for my downfall, I understand it all

But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga

So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga

I'm on that keflon vest shit, that wild wild west shit

And eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace

I shine so hard, I make mothafuckas wanna kill me

Every projects and every hood I go, they feel me

Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B

I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy

When I come out to play, had my mom been with me

You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me

Homeboy, frontin' on me will shorten your life span

Hold the mic with my left, the knife in my right hand



[Chorus - 50 Cent]

All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'

I'm supposed to die tonight

niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay

I'm down to ride tonight

Robin, Cagney or Lacey, it's 50 cent and Shady

The worst baby, put your hands on my people

I'll react crazy, put a hole thru ya front and ya back maybe

But dude if you try me, I'll have ya ass hooked up to an IV

I'll leave ya witnesses when I ride B

You fuck with me, you see

I'll react like an animal, I'll tear you apart

If the masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art

niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start

But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts (whoo)

So you take the good with the bad, I guess

Level three Teflon plate on my chest

And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber

Danger, anger will change ya

And make ya aim that and squeeze

We're walkin away from a beef, in which clearly you started

I said, were walkin away, did u hear me? You oughta

Be thankful that we aint beefin. Were still breathin and just leave it at THAT

That's when me and 50 and g-unit hop back in the BAT

Mobile it aint gonna be no more rap its gonna be RRRAT

Retaliation will be like them Muslim Shiite ATTACKS

Some where along the line its like me and 50 made PACT

He's got my back, I got his back, BACK

Its almost like were kinda, like Siamese twins

Cuz when we beef, we pull each other in,

To the bull shit like were conjoined at the hip,

Its just unavoidable, some of the shit is squashable

Some shit'll never boil over

Some of it will just simmer at best, if left alone

but let it be known there will be no sit downs

With no Daves and 'Zinos

There will be no peace discussions with me

There aint gone be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea

Just quit fuckin with me and ill gladly quit fuckin with you

Just spit ya 16 and do what you gotta do to get through

Without mentionin me or the machine or Jimmy Iovine

Or Dre or 50 or D-Twizzy, Obie and just let it be

Or we'll be back with a:.

I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it

Got 'em on the scheme, I'm plottin' in the county and I'm with it

You cross me and you gon' make a cemetery visit

That's gangsta, you know me I told it, cuz I live it

Showcases drop, when that chopper chop

Way up the block, get hit with copper tops

When drama pop, the llama pop

And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops

They say no, niggas know how I be on it

That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it

Its not a game, perfect ai,m you feel the flame

Up against ya brain, man its so hot I'll make ya wish it rained

I might smile and say whats up but I don't fuck with you niggas

My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas

I'm on the edge, I'm just waitin' on a nigga to push me

Put my hand on my strap, what you lookin' at pussy

We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends

So much chrome on my Benz, you see ya face in my rims

If your bitch wanna roll, I'ma let her get in

Backseat of my jeep, fuck till I fuck up her make up

Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob

Tell her if she like me she should keep me icey

My game fuck with a bitch brain till she think she wifey

Spent a life savings in a day, cause she likes me

Feel the rush, like a needles in your arm

Find out when you fuckin' broke, love won't get you on the bus

Man you should see the pretty bitches that be sexin' me

They suck cock that make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me

Hundred percent thug, freak too, I'll taste your love

I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag

Take one hit, I slide off to the land of the H man

When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me

Now you tryna leave me, you'll never live without me

Girl, I'm missin' you, come and see me soon

Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon

Now put that needle to ya arm princess, stick it in

Relapse you back bitch, don't ever try that again

All that shit I did for you, I made you feel good

We have a love thing, you treatin' this like its just a fling

What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring

You broke my heart, you dirty bitch I won't forget what you did

If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids

Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass start smokin'

But we have a bond and its not to be broken

Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional

They talk to you when you up, you down they got nothin' to say

But when you call, I'll come runnin', I'll always take the pain away

They set you up, to let you down, they crowned you prom queen

Fiddle about me behind your back, they call you a fuckin' fiend

Can we just be alone, so I can kiss and hug you

Push me inside you, no other man can loves you like I do

Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good

I found pleasure in pleasin' you, like a real man should

It was written long before, it was carved in a tree

Forever me and you baby we were meant to be

There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate

And we'll be hand in hand, when you walk through those pearly gates

And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

Here's a taste of my life, its bitter and sweet

I put my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat

I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street

Put my teflon on and roll with my heat

I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas

In a race for the cheese, I run laps around niggas

Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds

Soon as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok start sore

I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell

The east coast crib, the size of a small hotel

The shit journalist write about me, get me confused

Have me feelin' like the heavy weight champ when he lose

I read somewhere, I'm homophobic shiiit

Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick

Now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth

T&T around, I can still make blow move

Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it

When we ride to that ryder music (let's go)

Last year, I woke up, a good look, damn it feels good

On the low, I done fucked half of Hollywood

Had your favorite actress from your favorite shows

In my favorite position, you know how it goes

In my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit ""This is When Thugs Cry""

This is what it sounds like when hollow tip slugs fly

Homie, this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to

Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you

Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made

They make you wanna run across they're head with a switch blade

They point their finger at me, sayin' I'm bug

My flows crack you listen, your fuckin' brains on drugs

Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on the tec

Fool trippin' through the set, you can get ya ass whipped

Cards missin' out my deck, screws loose show respect

You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct

Pray to Lord, forgive me for my sins

Still thuggin', cruisin', rims gleamin'

Like the stones on my wrist

Zonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich

Homie, you hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch

Stupid, chase the paper, they come with the shit

I'm fallin', in love with success

Entrepeneure, kinda sewer, I maneuver the best

Rowin', ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle

Stunt I'll have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle

As wise men speak, I listen and learn

A man dies, a baby's born, my niggas the world turns

Rappers, I make 'em sick when I say I'm the shit

They mistake my confidance for arrogance, they hate on the kid

In '99, I had a vision and made a decision

Bein' broke is against my religion, now picked up

Hammer out the holster, gat in my lap in case u gotta get clapped

You monkey niggas swing through my hood, we on that gorilla shit

You clap off and miss, we come back and start killin shit

Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit

We organize discipline, plus we militant

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]

[Wierd intro by Yayo]



I'm in that coupe phantom, and the bodies kitted

Waves in my head, lookin like tsunamis hit it

niggas scheme, the infrared beam's on the mac

I put green on yo head like an Oakland A's hat

My boy was a dolja, now he a soulja

My lil' son ?? lettin off the ruger

In a whip mashed up, lookin for his enemies

Ridin and gassed up off double D batteries

Mass casualties, is hooked to them IV's

50 gimme the word, thats when I squeeze

Click clack, take that, fall back, its a contract

50 grand, and 50 man

Look at this stack
I got money

Aww nigga don't trip

I'll kill ya if you fuck with my grip

I won't hesitate to let off a clip

Aww nigga don't trip

You gon' make me get on some shit

Run up on you quick

Its 50 Cent bitch, G-Unit

Aww nigga don't trip



[Verse 1- 50 Cent]

I come through your hood, stuntin' in my yellow lam

Murcielago, top down, nigga damn

I'm the biggest crook from New York since son of Sam

Cruisin', bumpin' Bugz shit, ruger in my hand

Thinkin' the east ain't enough, its time to expand

I plan to head out west and plant my feet down

A nigga big as King Kong in the street now

I do a lil house shoppin', and buy me a crib

Its palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid

I touched the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks

Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on my dick

My mom turn in her grave if I married a white chick

But baby'll suck the chrome off the Chevy and shit

niggas be wearin' fake signs, I'm rockin' a lil charm

Thirty karrots on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don

Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weight in the bomb



[Chorus- 50 Cent]

nigga you hustle, but me I hustle harder

I got what you need, them trees, that heart, that powder

My niggas we gee packs, devour on the hour

They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in the position of power

You fuck around if you wanna



[Verse 2- 50 Cent]

Where I'm from, you learn to blend in, or get touched

I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch

niggas know my stage, they don't fuck with me son

You got an appetite for hollow-tips, I'll feed you my gun

This is that ferrari F-50 shit, its real layed back

Type shit you recline to in the Maybach

I got two suiters now, on the run from the fuzz

You get the same shit for ten bodies, you get for one cuz

I live life in the fast lane, 100 miles an hour, chrome and some wood grain

You know a nigga still really tryna move cane

Make a lil extra money on the side mayn

I ain't playin', I'm up early with the birds word

Puttin' that work in, parrelli's on the Porsche chirpin'

I got a hundred mill from music, a hundred grand from crack

Goin' to see my jeweler, so I can blow a stack



[Chorus- 50 Cent]

nigga you hustle, but me I hustle harder

I got what you need, them trees, that heart, that powder

My niggas we gee packs, devour on the hour

They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in the position of power

Ooh I'd lie for you baby
Ooh I'd die for you baby
[50 Cent overlapping]

I build you up

But if ever I fall down

And I need you to pick me up

Promise me you'll be around

Hold me down

I'll build you up



[Verse 1- 50 Cent]

Listen if you let me, I'll be the reason you shine

Its a secret I want the world to know that you're mine

But on some real shit, communications could be better

So I'm writin' a song, instead of a love letter

They can play it on the radio, a hundred times a day

I figure when you hear it, you would stop and think of me

I wanna get to know ya and be the reason you smile

Girl, you know where I'm from, you know how I get down

When times are tough, tell me that I'm special

Not rap, I mean me, that I'm special

You know they say diamonds are a girl's best friend

Precious stones, could you put me before them

If so, I'll see to it that they always around

Nothin' but the best now, how does that sound

If I talk with you, when we talk you can keep it

Girl, you on my mind all the time, its a secret



[Chorus x2- Jamie Foxxx]

Baby I'll build you up

Girl if I, never show I have you by my side

I build you up

Girl I need to know for sure you're mine

I need to know for sure



[Verse 2- 50 Cent]

I think about you thinkin' that you feel the same way

Was it just my imagionation again runnin' away

If you ready to ride girl come on let's roll

G-55 fly ma let's go

Its hard to measure the pleasure of havin' you in my present

Your smile makes me smile, I'll show you my style

We can shop a lil bit, I pick out my shit

One pair at a time, till your shoe games sick

Now who knows what the future holds, we'll be together probably

For better or worst, like Whitney and Bobby

If you wanna play house, we can play house then

But wait why pretend if you can move in

Before I be your buddy in bed, let me be your best friend

Girl, its more than lust, I want your trust

You keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you

Cause I know with you by my side, there's nothin' I can't do



[Chorus x2- Jamie Foxxx]

Baby I'll build you up

Girl if I, never show I have you by my side

I build you up

Girl I need to know for sure you're mine

I need to know for sure"

God made me shine like the sun

Sometimes I feel like I'm the one

Sometimes I feel like I'm the one

It ain't my fault

I just reach for style, I'm hot I breaks it down

It ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way I break it down



[Verse 1- 50 Cent]

Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly

But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me

When my cds drop, they sell the best

You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed

I'm a trackstar, runnin' through life, chasin' my dream

Best deal I made was tradin' the mic for that triple beam.

I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell

So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell

I need no answers to these questions, cuz time will tell

Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl

Don't much good come from me, but my music

Is a gift given from God so I'ma use it (Yeaaah!)

[Verse 2- 50 Cent]

Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself

Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself

I drift off on a cloud by myself

Thinkin' bout nothin' more than life, what else

These days its hard to tell who really cares for me

So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me

I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day

If times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay

A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time

You out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind

I'm a sponge, knowledge and wisdom, I absorb fast

I'm in a class by myself, you do the math



[Chorus]

God gave me style

God gave me grace

God gave me style

God gave me grace

God put a smile on my face

Haha, God put this smile on my face

God made me shine like the sun

God make me shine like the sun

Sometimes I feel like I'm the one

So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone

Tell me, whats on your mind when you're alone

Have ya touchin' on yourself, girl all in the zone

Now if I told you all

What things I say would I be wrong

Well then I wouldn't be right

Matter fact I'd be on the next flight

Tryna get it on with you tonight

Do the things you like

Touch the right spot, have ya piped and hot

While the wind blow through your hair in the drop

Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex

And let me to what I do until you climax

You can go straight to sleep after its all over

In the mornin' roll over and we can start over

Yeah I called just to say hope you havin' a nice day

You're special, I get into you, oops I mean I'm into you

Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you

Jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie

Better yet to watch you climb into the jacuzzi

Bubbles in the bath, don in the glass

Funny how time flies when you full of laughs

Its fun but before long, a nigga gotta dash

For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash

To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash

I know you like pumps and boots

I like jeeps and coupes, so I grind all the time, just gimme some loot

I put a spell on you, I like to call it a spell

In the bedroom, workin' it well, I don't kiss and tell

But I don't care if you kiss and tell

You can tell your girlfriend the details

Summer, winter, spring, and fall

I'll be around to catch ya calls

It is what it is man
Uh huh

Sirens flashin', you know the routine, the crime scene taped off

It started off a robbery, they blew half his face off

They seen him shinin', course full of diamonds he bought

Grindin', his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin'

The D's came through, asked the niggas if they knew what happened

Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin'

Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me

They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me

When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe

I turn a quarter to a half, thats why they mess with me

I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks

A little weed, a little X, a little H, a little crack

Figure, I push it to the limit, take this shit to the max

Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat

Calm, in my palm, fully loaded fire arm

First to let off, last to run, everytime its on

I tell niggas to suck my dick

Get the fuck out my face

Cause I don't need 'em

Cause they're never around

Fuck them O.G. niggas, they stuck in the eighties

Sayin' they gonna do me somethin', now you know thats a lie

nigga you look at me wrong, I'll let that hammer fly

I'm rich, I still wake up with crime on my mind

Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime

When I say move, nigga move or get caught in the cross fire

Up a fence runnin, cut my fuckin' hand on a barb wire

Shits crazy, just a different day, its the same shit

Hollow tip part in ya head, leave ya whole fuckin' brain split

They sit, they see me in the Ashton Martin

What's the matter, they can't get that Hoopty started

Thought they was grindin', well goddamn where that money at

Thought you was fucked, cause you was lettin' paper stack

You ain't a hustler, matter of fact, you's a busta

I don't trust ya, I shoulda sent niggas to touch ya

I tell niggas to suck my dick

Get the fuck out my face

Cause I don't need 'em

Cause they're never around

When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it

I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?

I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?

Shit basically they just playin sick

They ain't shit, they ain't sayin shit, spray em' fifty

A to the K get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me

And turn this day into fuckin mayhem, you stayin wit me?

Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you

When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu

You get the messege? Am I gettin through to you?

You know what's comin, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?

Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em' up in a pot

Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?

You got the realest and illest killas tied up in a knot

The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not

It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot

You put ya life in this, nothin like survivin a shot

Y'all know what time it is, soon as fifty signs on this dot

Shit what you know about death threats, cause I get a lot

Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building, they meant to hit ours

There's nothin spookier

Ya now about to witness the power of fuckin fifty

You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house

And if you got a glass jaw you should watch yo mouth

Cause I'll break yo face

Have yo ass runnin, mumblin to the jake

You goin 'gainst me dog, you makin a mistake, I'll split ya

Leave ya lookin like the Michael Jackson jackets wit all them zippers

I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper

The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper

Yo bitch a regular bitch, you callin her wifey

I fucked and feed her fast food, you keeping her icey

I'm down to sell records but not my soul

Snoop said this in ninety four, ?We don't love them hoes?

I got pennies for my thoughts now I'm rich

They get caught in the wrong hood, they get filled up wit holes

I walk the block with the bundles

I've been knocked on the humble

Swing the ox when I rumble

Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs

I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder

Sunny days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain

Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain

Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard

It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred

This if for my niggas on the block, twisting trees and cigars

For the niggas on lock, doing life behind bars

I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear

Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years

I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don

Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm

Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me

I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?



Many men, many, many, many, many men

Wish death upon me

Lord I don't cry no more

Don't look to the sky no more

Have mercy on me

Have mercy on my soul

Somewhere my heart turned cold

Have mercy on many men

Many, many, many, many men

Wish death upon me



Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back

I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat

In my nightmares, niggas keep pulling techs on me

Psych says some bitch done, put a hex on me

The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot

I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked

I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time

Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines

In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around

Homie shot me three weeks later he got shot down

Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason

'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing



Many men, many, many, many, many men

Wish death upon me

Lord I don't cry no more

Don't look to the sky no more

Have mercy on me

Have mercy on my soul

Somewhere my heart turned cold

Have mercy on many men

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 

I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love 

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed 



You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 

I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love 

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed 



When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs

When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club

Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, 

now they wanna show me love

When you sell like Eminem, 

and the hoes they wanna fuck 

But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up

I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up

If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp

Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp

In the hood then the ladies saying ""50 you hot""



They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac

But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya im loco

And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold

I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind

I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind

Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow

Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go



You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 

I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love 

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed 



You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 

I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love 

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed 



My flow, my show brought me the doe

That bought me all my fancy things 

My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels

Look nigga I got K-Mart and I ain't change



And you should love it, way more then you hate it

Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it

I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life

You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?

When my junk get to pumpin in the club it's on

I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone

If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn



If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned

I'm a tell you what Banks told me 

'cause go 'head switch the style up

If the niggas hate then let 'em hate 

Watch the money pile up

Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub

You know where we fucking be



You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 

I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love 

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed 



You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 

I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit

Give me some dro, purple haze, and some chocolate

Give me a dutch and a lighter I'll spark shit

And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit

I'm high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit



(Verse 1)

Everytime I ROLL up, niggas holla ROLL up, and I tell'em HOLD up,

You ain't gettin money you ain't smoking

In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzos, smoking on indo

Hiiigh as a motherfucker

I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat, only if you got beef

Man you better holla at me

Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up

Everytime I pop up, a lot going on in my hood



I shoot the dice, I holler get'em girls

Daddy need new shoes

Daddy need Perelli's to look mean on 22s

Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone

Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone

2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny

The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis

They was just harassing me cause they know who I was

Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud



(Chorus)



(Verse 2)

Now if you heard I done started some shit

It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)

And if you heard I done let off a clip

It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)

But I- twist that la, la, la, la



I get high as I wanna nigga

Go against me, fa sho, you's a goner nigga

I don't smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef

Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish

If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me man

I'd hate to be in the Benz clapping one of my fans

Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me

If you real my nigga, you know how to holla ""G-Unit!""

There's no competition, it's just me,

50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets

If David could go against Goliath with a stone

I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne



(Chorus)



(Verse 3)

Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines

And have hoes in the hood sniffin on white lines

You don't want me to be your kid's role model

I'll teach them how to buck them 380s and load up them hollows

Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot

Big blunt in his mouth, deuce deuce in his boot

Sit in the crib, sippin Guinness, watching Menace

Then Oh Lord, have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog

My team they depend on me when it's crunch time

I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime

You feeling brave nigga, go ahead get gully

See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully

I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me

Niggas calling me to feature, man fuck your money

I ain't hurting, I'm doing good

I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood



(Chorus)



G-Unit, are you ready

G-Unit, are you ready

G-Unit, are you ready

Nigga, ready or not, here I come, come, come"

I apply pressure to pussies that stuntin I pop

Stand alone squeezin my pistol I'm sure that I gotta

Now Peter Piper picked peppers but Run rocked rhymes

I'm 50 Cent, I write a lil bit but I pop nines

Tell niggaz, ""Get they money right,"" cuz I got mine

And I'm around quit playin nigga you can't shine

You gon be that next chump to end up in the trunk

After bein hit by the pump, is that what you want?

Be easy nigga, I'll lay your ass out

Believe me nigga, thats whut I'm about, gangsta

You could find a nigga sittin on chrome

Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas & I'm gone (Yeah! )

I'm waitin on niggaz to act like they dont know how to act

I've been feelin i had to teach lessons to slow learners

Go head act up, get smacked in the head with the burner

I dont fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty

I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga ya'heard me?

When streetlights come on niggaz blast the nines

Get locked up, they read books to pass the time

In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind

Niggaz on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind

They aint nothin they could do to stop my shine

This is God's plan homey, this ain't mine

I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance

And Grandma; who always gotta throw in her two cents

I'm the drop out who made more more money than these teachers

Roofless/Ruthless like the Coupe but I come with more features

I am whut I am, you could like it or love it

It feels good to pull 50 grand & think nothin of it

FUCK IT!

If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?

If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century

Could I count on you to be there 

to support me mentally?

If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz

Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?



If I was hit and I was hurt, 

would you be by my side?

If it was time to put in work, 

would you be down to ride?

I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive

I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside

If I ain't rap cause I flip burgers at Burger King

Would you be ashamed 



to tell your friends you're feeling me?

In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?

If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?

Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap

And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Would you love me if I was down and out?

Would you still have love for me?

Girl, it's easy to love me now

Would you love me if I was down and out?

Would you still have love for me?



Now, would you leave me

If your father found out I was thugging?

Do you believe me when I tell you

""You the one I'm loving""?

Are you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?

Are you my soulmate? Cause if so, girl, you a blessing



Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?

I'm staring at you, 

trying to figure how you got in them jeans

If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?

I'll treat you how you want to be treated, 

just teach me how

If I was with some other chick 

and someone happened to see

And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me

Would you believe me or up and leave me?



How deep is our bond 

if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

We only humans, girl, we make mistakes

To make it up, I'll do whatever it take

I love you like a fat kid love cake

You know my style, I say anything to make you smile



Girl, it's easy to love me now

Would you love me if I was down and out?

Would you still have love for me?

Girl, it's easy to love me now

Would you love me if I was down and out?

Would you still have love for me?



Could you love me in a Bentley?

Could you love me on a bus?

This is shit that I solved, with my balls, my ears

In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies

Frontin' like it's all fun and games, 'til they shot up bang

When you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playin'

Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night and ain't prayin'

And not lash back out at 'em, please

You want to see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall

I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart

So I see I have to start, showing you fuckin' old farts,

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

[50 Cent]

Some say I'm paranoid I say I'm careful how I choose my friends

Been to ICU once I ain't going again

First Zee got murked, then Raw got murked

An homies still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt

I smell somethin' fishy man it might be a rat

Damn niggaz switchin sides on niggaz just like that

U know me, I stay wit a bitch on her knees

An get guns away in the hood like government cheese

Spray on Suzuki's eleven hundred cc's

More plate on the back, straight squeezing a Mak

In the hood they identify niggaz by they cars

So I switch up whips to stay off the radar

I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot

I send Yayo to dump 30 shots on ya block

So spray dat Tec nigga if I say get it done

An make it wet niggaz if you round me son



[Hook]

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell

Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell

I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven



I gotta make it to heaven, fuck goin through hell

Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell

I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven



[50 Cent]

When I come through the hood, I don't stop the rapping niggaz

Get close enough to smack, get it clappin nigga

Pac tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass

Point blank range I span put a bone on his ass

Two weeks later niggaz came through with Maks to lay me down

Then sprayed I played Dami me get the fuck off the ground

Out the blue I get a phone call ?50 waddup?

U send a bitch at me I send the bitch back cut up

I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you boy

Front on me, you gon meet one of my soldiers boy

Cause Entwain shot up his mamma crib an now he in Jail

Trippin on Fliks an bogger trail, pussy in black tail

Pack mamma moved, but she don't talk to him no more

The shells from twains 4-4, blew the hinge off her do'

Without that Tec every month how she gon pay for the crib

Man social service finis' come an take dem kids



[Hook]

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell

Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell

I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven



I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell

Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck goin through hell

I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven



[50 Cent]

Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I can I change the courage 

the change the things I can, but wisdom know the difference

But A, Ade did a make you say dat I say dat

Thas the grade A burnin ya head when you a case act

Man I might talk to you while we up in the Benz

But when we come home, dat don't mean we gon fuck an be friends

Shells smash ya head close enough to hear 'em whistling

Thank god they missed you, an go grab ya pistol

In the hood niggaz runnin round actin crazy

Buyin little air Jordan's for maybe babies

See it might be his, an it might be yours

Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores

Man it don't take much for you to get in them draws

You ain't can have 'em on they back or on all fours

You got to tell me, you feelin this shit

Because I hear what I'm sayin I know I'm killin this shit



[Hook]

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck goin through hell

Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck goin through hell

I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven



I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell

Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven

I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell

It's 50 a.k.a Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got tyme to waste
Let's make it



[50 Cent]

You said you a gansta but you neva pop nuttin'

You said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'

You ain't a friend of mine, (huh)

You ain't no kin of mine, (nah)

What makes you think that I'ma run up on you with tha nine

We do this all tha tyme, right now we on tha grind

So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes

Shorty she so fyne, I gotta make her mine

A ass like dat gotta be one of a kind

I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every nine

I'm fuckin with they mind

I make 'em press rewind

They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme

Been on parole since 94 cuz I commit the crime

I send you my line, I did it three ta nine

If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes



[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]

You said you a gangsta

But you neva pop nuttin

You said you a wanksta

And you need to stop frontin'

You go to the dealership

But you neva cop nuttin'

You been hustlin a long tyme

And you ain't got nuttin



[Verse 2]

Damn Homie, in highskew you was tha man, homie

What tha fuck happened to you?

I got the sickest vendetta, when it come to the chedda

And if you play wit my paper, you gotta meet my berretta

Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin on amoretta

I'm livin once than deada, I know I can do betta

She look good but I know she after my chedda

She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her

Be easy, stop tha bullshit, you get your whole crew wet

We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step

Gorilla unit cuz they say we bugged out

Cuz we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out



[Chorus 2X]



[Verse 3]

Me I'm no monsta, me I'm no gangsta

Me I'm no hitman, me I'm jus me, me

Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no acta

But it's me you see on your TV

Cuz I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy

I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy

By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets

If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat

Niggas sayin they gon merk 50 how?

We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow

What you know about AK's and AR 15's?

Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf beams, huh

[Verse]

Niggaz wanna shine like me (me), rhyme like me (me)

Then walk around with a 9 like me (me) 

They don't wanna do it, 3 to 9 like me

And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me

Aiyoo, you think about shittin' on 50... save it

My songs belong in the Bible with King David

I teach niggaz sign language, that ain't def son

*click* *click* you heard that? That mean RUN

Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stun on, pa

Pull through, I'll throw a fuckin cocktail at ya' car

From the last shootout, I got a demple on my face

It's nothin', I could go after Mase's fanbase

Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out

Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out

I don't smile a lot, cause ain't nothin' pretty

Got a purple heart for war, and I ain't never left the City

Hos be like ""Fitty, you so witty""

On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy

You got fat while we starve, it's my turn

I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn

Won't learn



[Chorus 2X]

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me

You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me

It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me

Like me duke, you not like me



[Verse]

Moma said..

Everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan

So at night when I talk him, I got my gun in my hand

Don't think I'm crazy, cause I don't fear man

Cause I feel when I kill a man, God won't understand

I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan

I been coulda killed these niggaz, I'm still waitin

In the telly with to whores, a Benz with to doors

32 carrots in the traws, no flaws

You see me in the hood, I got atleast two guns

I carry the glock, Tony carry my M-1s

Hold me down nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me

D's waitin for my response to lock me

This is my hustle, nigga don't knock me

You need some shit with banana clips to try and stop me

I'M THE ONE



[Chorus 2x]

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me

You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me

It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me

Like me duke, you not like me



[Verse]

See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back

The good die young, I ain't eligable for that

I shot niggaz, I been shot, sold crack in the street

My attitude is gangsta, so I stand some beef

You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me

From 3 point range, with a glock, I shoot better then Kobe

See a nigga standin' next to me, he probably my Co-D

See a bitch gettin in my whip, she probably gon' blow me

See the flow is like a 38, it's special yoooooo

A country boy tell ya, I'm fittin' to blowwwww

I'm more like a pimp, then a trick, you knowwww

See, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hooos

Niggaz broke in the hood, worried about mines

Grown ass men, wearin starter piece shines

You know them little pieces, with the little stones

Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones

When the gossip starts, I'm always the topic

You too old for that shit dog, why don't you stop it

Shorty, I been watchin you watchin me

Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me

Haha



[Chorus 2x]

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me

You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me

It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me

Like me duke, you not like me

Nobody likes me, but that's okay
Cause I don't like y'all anyway
... And I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all!!
My watch talk for me, my whip talk for me

My gat talk for me

BLAT! Whattup homie

For bitches who don't know me

... They wanna blow me

Cause the shit I floss wit sayin a lot for me



[Verse One]

I came into rap humble, I don't give a fuck now

Serve anybody like niggaz who hustle uptown

Coke price go up, cats is come down

The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found

The bitch who hustle for me, they dont even stash tracks

They keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack

When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to

I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin head like a Hindu

Look, I ain't goin nowhere, so get used to me

OG's look at me and see what they used to be

I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope

The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to So So

The thug, they pop shit, the thug that pop clips

The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks

Nigga ain't in his right mind, goin against me

My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see



[Hook]

Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)

Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)

Murder! (I don't believe you!)

Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)



[Verse Two]

Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me

I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me

Make me catch her on the late night

Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six

I'm not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random

Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome

I hate to hear ""He say, She say"" shit

Unless he say she say she on my dick

It's no coincidence, niggaz who fuck wit me get shot up

I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up

You soft through, be puttin up a crazy front

I stay wit the Mac, cause niggaz tried to blaze me once

In the hood they be like, ""Damn, 50 really spitted on 'em""

""You heard that shit?"" ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em""

Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none

You just a small player in this game, play a part son



[Hook]



[Verse Three]

These cats always escape reality when they rhyme

That's why they write about bricks and only dealt wit dimes

Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car

Nascar, truck wit a crash bar, and TV's in the dash, pa

See 'em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa

I catch stunts when I ain't tryin 

I ain't lyin, I sit Dom P til I split up

Keep my rent split up

Get outta line, I get you hit up [Wooo!]

Now if you say my name in your rhyme, watch what you say

You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away

Now here's a list of MC's that can kill you in eight bars:

50, umm Jay-Z and Nas

I'ma say this shit now and never again

We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends

The games you playin, you get killed like that

Actin like you all hard, you ain't built like that

See me when you see me nigga, one (one)



[Hook]



Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me

I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me

You gon make me catch her on the late night

Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six"
