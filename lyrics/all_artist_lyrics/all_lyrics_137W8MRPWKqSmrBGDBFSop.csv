Co-roll to packin' minutes
I'm always back to business
I stay up out my feelin's
No goin' half and half
I want the whole stash

You might as well fast

I'm probably jet lagged

It's hard to see me in my ride cause I'm speedin' past

You probably only smoking dimes so your weed could last

And I'm the type to put a pound where I'm breathin' at

When I throw money on the ground she ain't leavin' that



Gotta complete the task

My technique advanced

I had plenty plans

My diamonds dance

Fell out with friends

Took trips to France

Smoked hella plants

Unlimited grams (unlimited grams)

I'll do it again (I'll do it again)

What movie we in?

Spit 20 I live

Pulled up in a Benz

My company wins

You wanna be rich

You gеt it fast then the end is gonna bе quick

I sit here and count this money up and don't even flinch

(Don't even flinch)

Keep sayin' they the one but I'm barely convinced

Keep sayin' they rollin' up but that's barely a pinch

I inspired you all along you just barely admit

Give you a couple reasons why I won't marry a bitch

I own every percent

I won't ever pretend

Never again

A veteran in

We setting the trends, coverin' every expense



Know how to pack a buildin'

Co-roll to packin' minutes

You probably only smoking dimes so your weed could last

And I'm the type to put a pound where I'm breathin' at

When I throw money on the ground she ain't leavin' that



'Rari believe it's fast

I'mma keep it a stack

Shoppin' bags in the front

My own gin in the back

It's my nature to stunt

I might need to relax

Tryna stay in control

They wanna see me crash

But really you don't want no problems, problems

Wish evil on my soul

I think I need some prayer (I think I need some prayer)

Might have a smile on her face, she gon' leave in tears

Ain't never did this before, I make her face her fears

Don't really catch me outside, these niggas all weird

Ain't tryna look at they 'selves, they don't involve mirrors

Don't want a hit of this kush, I don't see volunteers

If it's ever 'bout money you know I'm all ears

If you ain't rollin' somethin' you don't belong here

She gon' shot when she want to and plus she god fearin'

Spent some racks on designer that's what we all wearin'

Ten days in Miami that's called disappearin'



Know how to pack a buildin'

Co-roll to packin' minutes

I'm always back to business

I stay up out my feelin's

No goin' half and half

I want the whole stash

Rollin' joints with two girls, I think that they identical

Don't even need a mask, I hit the gas, now I'm invisible

Rollin' weed, don't even pass the glass like I'm the principal

She just bought that ass, I told her shake it fast like mystical

Buy thе beach, exclusive homеs

Only fuck with boujee hoes

I know someone who need it
So I'm bringing it all with me, all with me
Claim she yours, when you leave
She's sneaking and calling me, calling me
Money on the way, feel like I ain't make enough

Jets on the way, feel like I ain't take enough



Big bag motherfucker walking into the room

With a big on him finna smoke everybody out

Good Khalifa Kush finna choke everybody out

Been a real motherfuckin' G, everybody not

Don't talk money when you see me, boy, I got a lot

Flows, got plenty and respect, I got a lot

Keep my jar with me 'cause the kush I can't be without

Got the game in a chokehold, I don't need a lot

Niggas like ""Yo, Khalifa man"" when they see me out

I be so high can't even hear what you speaking 'bout

Blowing on kush so loud, blow the speakers out

Got a reputation, I suggest y'all watch your mouth

Know it's my whip when you see it in the parking lot

Know it's my shit when you hear it, you should spark it up

Know they ain't fucking with the kid

Nah, nigga, they ain't hard as us

Y'all the shit falling off garbage truck



I don't gotta light one up

Mine already lit, mine already lit, so

I don't gotta fire one up

I'm already lit, I'm already lit, you know

The checks keep coming, checks keep coming

The checks keep coming, checks keep coming

The checks keep coming, checks keep coming

The checks keep coming, checks keep coming



When I ride in, they like

""Is that a nigga on a horse and a bad bitch in a Porsche?""

They know my name 'cause I carried the torch

All weak shit get extorted

Might need a forklift, the bag I just made is too heavy

God damn, that's a fortune

You can't afford to live the life I live

Bring the whole thing back then I'm breaking down the portion

This shit get ugly like a sport gets

Get sticky, bitch niggas might forfeit

Real picky with my choices, this is for the chip

Sleep with one eye open, never slip

If she humble then I gift her

Looking niggas crazy any time they don't tip her

The lights in my chain the Big Dipper

This ain't a rent-a-yacht, I just seen Flipper



I actually do cuss a little

Do you? What's your favorite curse word?

Probably ""Fuck""



I don't gotta light one up

Mine already lit, mine already lit, so

I don't gotta fire one up

I'm already lit, I'm already lit, you know

The checks keep coming, checks keep coming

The checks keep coming, checks keep coming

The checks keep coming, checks keep coming

The checks keep coming, checks keep coming



And that's the bottom line

Windows tinted on it so they can't see what's in

Been a G from the beginning

Only see my team winning

Beat sounding sick thanks to my engineer

Flick another ash while I steer

Top down, blowin' smoke up to the clouds

Wasn't fuckin' with us but they open for us now

I'm throwin' pre-rolls in the crowd

And I'm knowin' what's the outcome

Hustle hard the next tеn years and get a house from it

You alrеady know how my company comin'

Next year's whips before they even get shit

Did it all before but I'm tryna do it all again (All again)

Did it all before but I'm tryna do it all again (All again)

The next one gon' be bigger than the first

A rich nigga look wealthier in person

Tell me I already do it big

I'm still workin' on a better version

Niggas usin' straight lines, I'm rappin' in cursive

The cuffs off now, so I'm hurtin' niggas

They love me better when I'm stoned

Some niggas love you better when you broke

I'm ridin' 'round, givin' youngins hope

Raisin' my son, focus on my business how I'm s'posed to

To get to it, really gotta go through it

Big spliff burnin', listenin' to slow music

What you say, I heat up this plate

Take Jace to the face, shrooms middle of day

Used to like cheap shit till I elevated her taste

Say she like free shit, so I put my hand on her waist

Like rough shit, roll up backwoods, she a tough bitch

Well, I'm gon' put her on papers

Her nigga outside and can't get in

Don't do anything to save her

They ain't rollin' up kush like cap

You might wanna bring your inhaler 'cause you probably need it

No rookie here, I'm a seasoned vet

Sweet flowers the only thing you smell 'cause this weed is seedless

I'm rolling up, I don't need a reason

Sixth sense starting to kick in I can't even see shit

You can't party with my gang, you on the D-list

Smoke one with Kat, her life's completed

Make sure my rig is the cleanest, swing in my dress like I'm Jesus

She wanna wear my jersey, it's real nigga season

Tell her to take some shrooms, that liquor be turnin' her evil

Time to get out of your feelings I don't got time for no demons

Gettin' all suspicious cause you actin' single

Was supposed to kick it for a day, you stay for a week

Come and give me life

Come and get me right

Come and give me life



I'm putting that pressure on 'em

Ain't stuck in my place, I'm seeing the top

So I'm 'bout to level up

I don't like the pack then I bring it back

Say ""Bring a better one""

These niggas just talk, that's really all cap

That's shit that they've never done

My team in the front and they in the back

I'm always ahead of them"

I'm the nigga of the year

Tell her have no fear, yeah, yeah

A real nigga's here

I told her, ""Touch yourself

And I'll be there at spirit""

Yeah, yeah, I'm the one who cares

Pull up on me so I can smear it

Knock it out the park

Do it like Sammy Sosa did it

Them niggas so sold

My dope so good likе it come from Sosa

They don't invite mе into their crib, ashin' on they sofa

My shrooms so good, watch 'em take you on that rollercoaster

I'm pullin' out foreign whips and even big bodies with chauffeurs

Them niggas couldn't see me if they try so they look closer

I'm buyin' all the Céline in my hotel, she want mimosas

Out of everyone they see, they gon' pick me because I'm chosen

In the bus, I roll it, swole it

In the doors, I open, close it

In the truck, I got some, pole it

You put her on the pavement plan, I put her on the ocean

I don't play the game, I coach it



They ain't gotta ask 'cause they already know it

I'm on my way

You don't likе being around a lot of people

I got a placе we can both go

I got some curves like the rainbow

I heard you looking for that pot of gold

I got some shrooms if you wanna take em

Take your emotions and let em go

No we ain't doing the same things

If you don't try it you'll never know

I'll put your bags on a private plane

I'll hit you up keep it on the low

You got me floating in outer space

We always high, we ain't never low

You tell the truth, you don't let me disguise it

I'm pickin' you cause you really the prize

Thinkin' bout pickin' you up to go buy some shit

Dreamin' bout you and how high I get



Why'd I slip?

Won't ever do it again, you won't get away

When I'm with you, I be feelin' safe

Other ones come out, I'll entertain them

Keep it a buck, they just in the way

We in the wind when I'm feeling the pain

Girl, you the one, you my motivation

The only one I'ma stay with, properly faded

Did a lot when I was young, now I think different cause I'm a man

When you grow up, they don't understand

Better things come with another plan

Ain't ever ask for a helping hand

But I have people to give me advice

In the real world, they don't tell you twice

I made a whole lot of sacrifices



You don't like being around a lot of people

I'm pickin' you cause you really the prize

Thinkin' bout pickin' you up to go buy some shit

Dreamin' bout you and how high I get



Thinkin' bout you when I'm rollin' up joints and I'm bout to slide

Ain't outside lookin' for vibes

All of my parties are private

All of my joints roll nice

Lucky room neon lights

Look at that girl roll dice

Say she like gambling

Flash on turn to a cameraman

The girls love camera and her nigga online

Scrolling through Instagram scrambling

We take a pic that's damaging

When you get home gotta handle it

Floating on weed, floating on shrooms

Two of your homegirls dancing

Both of my hands in, we in my mansion

Always stay solid, I keep it



You don't like being around a lot of people

I got a place we can both go

I got some curves like the rainbow

Got me thinkin' 'bout that time I told you, ""You the GOAT""

Your hair back, I probably tie for you, you in mode

To get you off, that's my constant goal

Then have a decent conversation 'fore it's time to go

I got some pounds and some pre-rolls for when it's time to smoke

Them niggas say they original, but they copy though

I'm hoppin' on a private plane, meet me on the boat

Pickin' which car I wanna drive like eeny-miny-moe



Hop out a tub with ice cubes in it

I'm a hard working man, I'ma need me a minute to chill

You might've heard the life I live is amazing

But you spend time with me, you gon' see it's for real



Rollin' up another one still

Everything goin' uphill, that's how I feel

Close another million dollar deal

Boss nigga, but I'm in the field, that's how I feel



Break it down, roll it up a lil'

Goin' a hundred miles with the top down, hope it don't spill

Soak it in, tell me how it feel

Lookin' for an openin', me and my team posted over here

Got some weed, blow it in the air

Lotta Gs doin' a lotta things so we 'posed to persevere

Got my team closer 'cause we care

Nah we ain't fallin' for the bullshit 'cause we focused over here

How you don't like it but you ain't try it yet? (Try it yet)

How you don't smoke it but you ain't buy yet? (Buy yet)

Wanna get high and then you can be my guest (My guest)

No runnin' out, you come with me, you find extras



Rollin' up another one still

Everything goin' uphill, that's how I feel

Close another million dollar deal

Boss nigga, but I'm in the field, that's how I feel



Tryna get the love I give

Bro, you got the wrong idea, homie, not right here

Rollin' up and light my fears

Holdin' up the life with my peers, you got it right here"

Prolly with a G throwin' up gang signs

And I don't havе to try that, baby, can't deny that

When she hit thе kush, it make her choke, she have to fight back

Them niggas interrupt the session, we don't like that

If you got kush and got a cone, then you should light that

And I'll be right back

Had to get a leash 'cause I'm tired of askin' niggas where my light at

Hope you brought your own bud, 'cause if it's the bomb, then we might match

Put it out before you burn a hole in the couch

Smokin' kush with my young niggas from the South

They be like, ""Cap, why that joint so fat?

And why it have to hit like that?""

Fillin' ashtrays, lotta roaches, that's a fact

No matter the case, all of my niggas smoke pack

Pull out of the case, I got some kush that's throwback

Get out of my face, you little niggas so wack

She's smokin' the better weed with me and all that

And I got a plan for me to get it all back

If you need a pound, then you can get a callback

Smokin' the bombest weed with me, it's all facts

They really just talk, it ain't really all that

We rollin' it all and we gon' get you high fast

You rollin' with bosses

You rollin' with bosses



Let's all just smoke it, baby, let's all just roll and smoke get high

Money ain't thing 'cause I got paper to blow.
I'm heavy in the game it ain't a thing to a pro.
Baby I'm a star & you already know that I'm gettin' bankroll (bankroll [x10])
(Yeah) See me I was cheifin' on my reefer getting blowed.

In my home alone that's when Sledgren hit my phone, he said Wizzle what you doing [?]

I said we should hit the club, I could swing thru & grab Motor cuh you just hit money up.

Then I jumped in the shower, took me bout an hr, smoked a blunt of ray then put on my star power.

All black Chuck Tays, some Armani frames, 15 carats in my chain bitch I'm heavy in the game.

In my truck I'm switching lanes, feel that beat off in my trunk.

I'm smokin' Mary Wayne, I speed off to the hood & we gone roll about 10 blunts 'fore I'm ready.

I'm spending all this cash up tonite, if you let me.



Blowin' on this ray, spitting game to these hoes. Money ain't thing 'cause I got paper to blow. I'm heavy in the game it ain't a thing to a pro. Baby I'm a star & you already know that I'm gettin' bankroll (bankroll [x10])



(So much fuckin' money I don't know what to do with it. Haha yeahh)



I tap my horn once, I tap again.

This nigga must not hear me, I OOOWOOP he let me in.

I meet up with my mens, then dip out to the spot.

The whole Khalifa gang, 10 cars deep off in the lot.

You [?] off in the front, we creepin' thru the back.

And we gone blow some stacks, them hoes ain't know how to act.

No I.d. I'm underage but far from underpaid.

I'm fresh to death, stay fly until I'm sleep off in a grave.



(Until I'm sleep off in a grave)



You got them hoes you fuck with groupies that I used to know.

Say you gettin' money man, now money's what I choose to blow.

Finna pop some bottles, scream I'm thru.

Came to shut the club down (club down) so make some room. I'm...

(Ohh, it's finna pop off now. Haha, yeahhhhhhh bitch)



Now we in the club, hear the DJ scream my name.

He shout out Heavy Hustle cause the DJ know my gang.

I'm standin' on the couch in V.I.P. I swing my chain.

The DJ play my song, I throw my cheese & go insane.

And I got what they need, they come & shake it for a boss.

These hoes just out here choosin' homie take it as a lost.

Sweat comin' out my pores (pores) this Patron got me heated.

Security know what it is with me, I'm gettin' weeded.

The hoes say I'm conceited. Niggas say I'm a fool.

My chain is fuckin' freezey, this shit is kinda cool.

And I'm the kind of dude to walk behind ya boo, tell her fuck ya man, I'm the man what you tryna do [?]

Spin the parking lot and fuck the finest thing I come across
Phone full of missed calls, keep some bitches on my line
Conscious with my conversation, caking is my occupation

Keep them 'rillos rolling up, filled to the tipple

Good weed and I blow it by the zip, I'm in my whip

Riding weed and switching lanes, cruising to my newest shit

Hoes been acting funny so I'm fucking with my newest bitch

Everything designer on, diamonds look like Lemonheads

On the beach with foreign freaks, you tricking with them chickenheads?

Gotta get my bread (bread) so I hardly sleep at night

I do a show to studio, I'm just in time to catch a flight

Young but I'm paid, it comes from grinding everyday

And having patience, blowing Master Kush in my spaceship





Cruising with my hat back, tat-tat-tatted up

Gucci on my loafers, getting chauffeured now my status up

Paid to cost, I'm the thinnest boss, fuck them other guys

Blowing weed I'm never sober, you can't tell me otherwise

Name well known, ranked at the top

Bad bitch in every city, big face on the watch

Kush on my clothes, big bank in my knot

Smoke a hundred cigarillos, pullin straight up out a pillow

Now I'm eating, staplin in cases for my pillows

To my city I'm a prince so I sit behind tints

Mad I found an avenue to get my revenue

I'm with a model bitch cheifing in a tailor made suit

Taylor Gang president, heavy hustle under boss

In my car blowing smoke signals out the roof

Money conversation talking paper then come fuck with me

I'm in the air, that's why you look up to me, you know?"

Don’t give it up first night, that’s torture

Pull up in the truck, all white, that’s a fortune

Player of the Year, that’s right I’m awarded

Some might pay, but I get mines free

Somе might trick, I don’t pay no fee

I run G-A-M-E

Might’ve got paid, but it ain’t from me

I don’t have fun, life ain’t complete

She say pay, I say, “Bitch, please

I’m a player, can’t you see?”



Looking for a gift, this ain’t Christmas Eve

Gotta watch dips with them tricks up sleeves

Wanna take sips, wanna hit this weed

Say it ain’t shit like it get perceived

Got a lot of chains like Mr. T

Left with a couple ’cause she just a thief

But down bad yesterday, this her week

Then onto the next nigga, yes, indeed

Yes, need a bad one that’ll ease my stress

Got some real ones in my corner, I’m blessed

She in love with me if she confess

We done came up, see the progress

On a mission and she impressed

Kept it 100, I expect the same from you

Held it down for me every time them lames come through

Said they was down to do the shit I did but they ain’t want to

Now every time it come on, you get uncomfortable

Been a couple years since you left, you see how time flew

You been on my mind everyday, I’m on your mind too

Make me think about all the shit that I survived through

I be ridin’ around by myself, but that’s what pride do

Got you thinking ’bout what you said and how it’s not true

A good one or a bad one depending on where you stay

Just let me know if it’s safe

‘Cause we done did shit that you can’t erase

And fuck the shit I bought, I gave you game that you can’t replace

Came up in a major way

Quit moving out of fear, started moving out of faith

You tell me that you heard our favorite song the other day

First you was trying to leave, now you say you’re on your way

That’s the price to pay, I guess that’s what love cost

Just cause you walked out the door, don’t mean the love lost

Seen it at a concert, you called off work, even bought the shirt

Was glad we was there for the crowd surf

We said that night, we both found our purpose

Had both our hands going in circles, listened over and over

Trying to find out what the words was

It came from a band we never heard of

But now it’s the soundtrack to our life

Rolled up all day to it, ride all night

Every time we turn it on, people said all kind of shit

Now you gone, go figure

So you better not play it for another nigga"

You gave mе the signs but I was too naive to read it then

I always be a student but I’ll never let you teach again



I’m floating away from what's on the ground

There’s too many lies in this cold hard town

Missing the pain, glad it's over now

But we're not even

How long will it take till it all falls down?

You want me to break but I don't know how

You should be afraid when you see me now

‘Cause we’re not even



My head in the clouds

It's hard to believe that someone wanna bring me down

Hard to believe that you don't get proud every time you see me now

Hard to believe you don't think of your dreams and want to live 'em out

Hard to believe we can't just get some peace and love, that's what I'm 'bout

I'm tryna do it if it count

Put it in motion, don't make an announcement

Don't really care if nobody can vouch

Don't really care what the money amount to

As long as I'm happy, don't care about clout

Long as I'm healthy, don't care about nothing, I feel like I'm wealthy

Ain't telling me shit 'cause there ain't really shit you can tell me



I'm floating away from what's on the ground

There's too many lies in this cold hard town

Missing the pain, glad it's over now

But we're not even

Even though I can’t hear your voice, I still feel your guidance everyday
Every breath you take, every move you make, that’s what you say while you’re watching me
Throughout the day and even when I sleep
When my flesh makes me weak, you see the God in me
Forcing me to be what I’m destined to be

Damn near feel like you’re carrying me

At times when I felt like I would drown, you pulled me back to the surface

Nurture my heart with words of encouragement

Told me shit like, “You too good for that”

Patted me on my back to congratulate me and show me what it really meant to be to be myself

And now I feel like I can fly, the same way you fly

I know one day our paths will collide again, I ain’t trippin’

I got shit to do and you got more miracles to work too

And you can do way more where you’re at than where you were

You ain’t have to leave here, but you did

You knew your purpose was bigger and you accepted it

And for that, I’ll always thank you

I be acting tough, but I miss you though

Crackin’ jokes and shit

I even still got that video of you and Bash when we came to see you a while ago

And even though you may not be here physically

When shit gets tough and I don’t know who to call

And I feel like I can’t take no more

And there’s no one else on the road

You still walk with me



Started losing friends too early

Maybe seventh grade, B Leu was like my brother

They shot him in his head

Invite him to my birthday party

He the only one that came, I never knew from that day I’d never be the same

Early mornings watching news I seen another murder

Seventh grade middle school, just to show me a burner

Jasmine’s cousins wanted to jump me because I made her cry

Wasn’t before the year was over one of them nigga died

Eighth grade for some reason I was desensitized

Ninth grade I moved away to live another life

My mom sent me to high school on the other side

‘Cause when Greg got killed she was traumatized

Houser was the fuckin’ man when he was alive

Taught us everything we know about gettin’ fried

Teff was young and dissing from the city

So they felt like they had to come through and slide

My Uncle Mon P was a younger nigga

All I ever did was have fun with him

I can’t imagine nigga having beef with him

It’s fucked up my son didn’t get to meet him



So many lanes, so many riders, so many things with family ties

Mainer got killed over a chick he was right beside

When OG passed away, I was so surprised

Was on the road with Chevy when I heard Ray died

When Evan got killed I knew shit wasn’t right

I could still see the look in his sister’s eyes

They shot Wapo in his head the day that he signed

Not to mention my brother, felt like my heart died

No pride, no Mac Miller, the whole ride

When Nip passed away, I fasho cried

A lot of pain, but I don’t even show it

Nigga probably didn’t even know that I got all these damn homies



So many lanes, so many riders, so many things with family ties

So many lanes, so many riders, so many things with family ties

Sledg was like my big brother

Used to pull up for beats

Used to hear me in that Bonneville all the way up the street

He put me on the game, he had all the freaks

Taught me how to dress, but showed me shit wasn’t sweet

Chevy was older than me, didn’t know that we would meet

I did a song at the studio with him and Freeze

Used to be on the battle scene

If anyone owed me money they had to talk to Breeze

Not to mention he taught me lots of things

Like how to clean up my circle, stay low from police

S used to be the big homie, till he made a diss song ’bout me

Late nights in the studio me, him and Bo

He was the sickest in the city, had the illest flow

They had pounds of haze when was smoking dro

Counted like ten stacks in front of me after school

When Spitta came to scoop me up, he had the 2

I wasn’t carrying, he said I had to have one too

These in the city catch you when you passing through

And I’ll be damned if I don’t do what I have to do

I met Shipes at South By, he was hella cool

He introduced me to DZA, now that’s my man too

Me and Krit went on our first tour

I moved to Cali and met Big U

Always smoking I would trick tricks since early days in Michigan

This shit I don’t say in my interviews

A lot of love and ain’t afraid to show it

You nigga probably didn’t even know that I got all these real homies



This one right here is for all my, all my, all my homies

This one right here is for all my, all my homies

Was it just good fun or maybe an addiction?
Try not to make decisions while I’m sippin’
‘Cause I know the consequences
Relationships from the past that never get rekindled
Sad ’cause I was movin’ too fast to remember

No brake pads, this ain’t accidental

When shit get bad just got to continue

My pops mad ’cause I didn’t want to live with him

My mom’s stressin’ ’cause my older sister transgender

So I was plotting on some things that was monumental

But I didn’t know about the demons that was at the centеr

The circumstances I came up, thеy was detrimental

But I was right there signing up to represent them

For all the shit I did, I hope that I’ll be forgiven

I try to smile through the pain but I still feel it



Nobody knows you like I do (Nobody, nobody)

And I care for you

(You know that I care)

You say that you love me

The way I love you (You know that I love you, I love you)

Oh, oh



Did me dirty, that’s some shit that I gotta live with

Thought they always keep it real, they obviously didn’t

Smile in my face, my back, stick a knife right in it

Thought they meant what they was saying, they was just pretending

Didn’t know they’d take their chance soon as they get it

Didn’t know they’d turn their back on me, but they did it

Turned on me like their hands on a clock for minutes

I’m paranoid ’cause I felt like a target when I

Spoke my mind, so I made my subconscious bigger

Got complexes that I didn’t know that I developed

Dark places in my mind I don’t want to visit

Shit I’ve been through, I wouldn’t want no one to deal with

Like both parents, have to pick which one to live with

Like growing up with a misunderstood sibling

If you don’t know what I know, you don’t know the feeling



Nobody knows you like I do (Nobody, nobody)

And I care for you

(You know that I care)

You say that you love me

When the days turn to nights

I keep thinking ’bout you moving on (Woo)

Makes me wonder if you hear this song (Yeah)

Would you right the way that we went wrong?

Yeah, when the days turn to nights

That’s when I begin to lose it all

Makes me wonder if you hear this song

Would you right the way that we went wrong?



Seen it at a concert, you called off work, even bought the shirt

Was glad we was there for the crowd surf

We said that night, we both found our purpose

Had both our hands going in circles, listened over and over

Trying to find out what the words was

It came from a band we never heard of

But now it’s the soundtrack to our life

Rolled up all day to it, ride all night

Every time we turn it on, people said all kind of shit

Now you gone, go figure

So you better not play it for another nigga"

Used that to think all that I wanted was a thousand women

Not really tryna pay it forward with the life I'm living

Now I'm a lil' bit older, I see things different

Used to think all that I wanted was a thousand women

Now I feel more mature, all I think about is children

Runnin' 'round my backyard while I'm smokin' out and chillin'

Teach 'em how to run the business, give 'em all Black privilege

Gotta treat yourself more delicate and be more respectful

Try to use more empathy, think about what karma gets you

Don't take advantage, even if they let you

Live in the moment, treat it like it's special

Gotta keep your circle clear, ride with the ones who protect you

You ain't on the right path? Need someone who gon' correct you

Heal your mind and soul, help refresh you

Need to talk? Be someone you confess to

Line your actions up with your intentions

Know your boundaries, enforce your limits

When you lie, the only person you kill is

The person standing in the mirror

Started losing friends too early

Maybe seventh grade, B Leu was like my brother

They shot him in his head

Invite him to my birthday party

He the only one that came, I never knew from that day I’d never be the same

Early mornings watching news I seen another murder

Seventh grade middle school, just to show me a burner

Jasmine’s cousins wanted to jump me because I made her cry

Wasn’t before the year was over one of them nigga died

Eighth grade for some reason I was desensitized

Ninth grade I moved away to live another life

My mom sent me to high school on the other side

‘Cause when Greg got killed she was traumatized

Houser was the fuckin’ man when he was alive

Taught us everything we know about gettin’ fried

Teff was young and dissing from the city

So they felt like they had to come through and slide

My Uncle Mon P was a younger nigga

All I ever did was have fun with him

I can’t imagine nigga having beef with him

It’s fucked up my son didn’t get to meet him



So many lanes, so many riders, so many things with family ties

Mainer got killed over a chick he was right beside

When OG passed away, I was so surprised

Was on the road with Chevy when I heard Ray died

When Evan got killed I knew shit wasn’t right

I could still see the look in his sister’s eyes

They shot Wapo in his head the day that he signed

Not to mention my brother, felt like my heart died

No pride, no Mac Miller, the whole ride

When Nip passed away, I fasho cried

A lot of pain, but I don’t even show it

Nigga probably didn’t even know that I got all these damn homies



So many lanes, so many riders, so many things with family ties

So many lanes, so many riders, so many things with family ties

Sledg was like my big brother

Used to pull up for beats

Used to hear me in that Bonneville all the way up the street

He put me on the game, he had all the freaks

Taught me how to dress, but showed me shit wasn’t sweet

Chevy was older than me, didn’t know that we would meet

I did a song at the studio with him and Freeze

Used to be on the battle scene

If anyone owed me money they had to talk to Breeze

Not to mention he taught me lots of things

Like how to clean up my circle, stay low from police

S used to be the big homie, till he made a diss song ’bout me

Late nights in the studio me, him and Bo

He was the sickest in the city, had the illest flow

They had pounds of haze when was smoking dro

Counted like ten stacks in front of me after school

When Spitta came to scoop me up, he had the 2

I wasn’t carrying, he said I had to have one too

These in the city catch you when you passing through

And I’ll be damned if I don’t do what I have to do

I met Shipes at South By, he was hella cool

He introduced me to DZA, now that’s my man too

Me and Krit went on our first tour

I moved to Cali and met Big U

Always smoking I would trick tricks since early days in Michigan

This shit I don’t say in my interviews

A lot of love and ain’t afraid to show it

Was it just good fun or maybe an addiction?
Try not to make decisions while I’m sippin’
‘Cause I know the consequences
Relationships from the past that never get rekindled
Sad ’cause I was movin’ too fast to remember

No brake pads, this ain’t accidental

When shit get bad just got to continue

My pops mad ’cause I didn’t want to live with him

My mom’s stressin’ ’cause my older sister transgender

So I was plotting on some things that was monumental

But I didn’t know about the demons that was at the centеr

The circumstances I came up, thеy was detrimental

But I was right there signing up to represent them

For all the shit I did, I hope that I’ll be forgiven

I try to smile through the pain but I still feel it



Nobody knows you like I do (Nobody, nobody)

And I care for you

(You know that I care)

You say that you love me

The way I love you (You know that I love you, I love you)

Oh, oh



Did me dirty, that’s some shit that I gotta live with

Thought they always keep it real, they obviously didn’t

Smile in my face, my back, stick a knife right in it

Thought they meant what they was saying, they was just pretending

Didn’t know they’d take their chance soon as they get it

Didn’t know they’d turn their back on me, but they did it

Turned on me like their hands on a clock for minutes

I’m paranoid ’cause I felt like a target when I

Spoke my mind, so I made my subconscious bigger

Got complexes that I didn’t know that I developed

Dark places in my mind I don’t want to visit

Shit I’ve been through, I wouldn’t want no one to deal with

Like both parents, have to pick which one to live with

Like growing up with a misunderstood sibling

If you don’t know what I know, you don’t know the feeling



Nobody knows you like I do (Nobody, nobody)

And I care for you

(You know that I care)

You say that you love me

The way I love you (You know that I love you, I love you)

Oh, oh

You know that I care

Oh, oh

And I’ll be right there



No one knows you, no one knows you

No one knows you like I do

No one knows you, no one knows you

No one knows you like I do

No one knows you, no one knows you

No one knows you like I do

No one knows you, no one knows you

No one knows you like I do"

If you fuckin’ with me you know there’s a lot of layers to me

Ooh, give me that new Celine

Everything is rare with me

Every time I left the crib, my parents said a prayer for me

Working on it everyday, I’m trying to be a better me

I ain’t even got no problems, always learned to let it be

Holding on to what you’re feeling, safe you’ve got to let it free

Never let nobody change you, don’t sell your integrity

Ain’t no problem, I start it, I’ma finish it

You should feel lucky as fuck just ’cause you get to witness

Always riding for my teammates, I live everyday like my b-day

Feel like life is like a relay so let’s race

You ain’t paid your dues like we pay

So I gotta thank God like each day

And they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne,
You would too if every night you seen the same thing
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all,
When you die you can't take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I'm drinking with ya

Cause most niggas is broke their bank is injured

Then bitches gonna ride with who they think's a winner

And I'll be smiling in case they take a picture

Oh, I'm smoking weed drinking liquor make a hundred

On a show spend it all on my niggas

When I go shopping I tell them pick one

Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision

Always about my business don't play the cards

I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uhh

Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah



[Chorus:]

I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day

I'm a take all this money I own and blow it all away

Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone

I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day

I'm a take all this money I own and blow it all away

Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone



[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]

Hella hoes in my car, they wanna feel that maximum speed

Never had an absence of weed

Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V,

Plus the most exclusive treat in my jar

Making my bank, spending it all

And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on

She taking it off, most of these niggas just talk and taking it off

Back in the day money was short, I'm making it taller

You know what I mean, some say it's a problem

Blowings my greens, not saving my collards

No NBA, they say I'm a baller

Live for today, it's not like my father



[Chorus:]

I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day

I'm a take all this money I own and blow it all away

Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone

I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day

I'm a take all this money I own and blow it all away

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
It's the champagne pourin'
Big joint rollin'

Bombay sippin'

No blunt smoking

Bad bitch gettin'

Thick and she got some friends with her

I take 'em out pourin' shots of liquor

Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures

The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter

Nigga, you know everything Taylored

Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper

That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through

Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to

Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool

That's what I have to do



[Chorus:]

See after drinking champagne all night

Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might

Homie I'm on my level (yeh)

I'm on my level (yeah)

I'm on my level (yeh)

I'm on my level (yeaah)



So let me take one shot to the brain

And I order three more shots

I'm going in, ayy

I'm on my level (yeh)

I'm on my level (yeah)

I'm on my level (yeh)

I'm on my level (yeaah)



[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]

Spent a couple dollars on my engine

Motor roaring when I back out the garage

Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar

Plus I'm struggling tryna find the keys to my car

Cause I be going hard, roll the camera

Life just like a movie, I'm the star

Wish you was in my position

You too broke to play the part

Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back

Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin'

All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin'

Straight out the burb, we drinking we smash niggas

So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mate

All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne



[Chorus]



[Verse 3: Too Short]

In the middle of the night, early in the mornin'

From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin'

I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin', we ain't sleepin'

These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin'

We just freakin'

You rollin' with short dog baby

She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady

Come to my house I give 'em everything they want

I might not dot it, but I give to ya women

Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, Marijuana

She can suck it if she wanna

I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends

And this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend



[Chorus]



[Bridge:]

Man I'm high as fuck

Man I swear I'm on my level

Man I'm sloppy drunk

Man I swear I'm on my level

I finna pass out

Man I swear I'm on my level

A nigga get smashed out

Know some will say that lifes a bitch
Well I'm a flirtin and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is

Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants

Keep verses, Mortal Kombat

Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' then what you call that

Nothing but neck and back cause I never left

I did everything right nigga better yet

Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us

Something like a contractor building from the ground up

Now just

Twist up this weed

Realise that you are in the presence of a G

Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese

Or the ones I use to roll up my trees

Fuck it, you know what I mean

I'm riding round, smoking, good music aloud

Kinda do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me

Some smile up in your face but then they don't on the low

Now I just stunt on my own

Now I just stunt on my own



I'm in a race, and taking the winners place

No foot on the brakes

One the best, homie that's what they call me

It's lonely at the top, got no company so

Now I just stunt on my own

Now I just stunt on my own

See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me

My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me

But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty

Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's

Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's

My dime piece only recognise the best tree's

Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe

You in her face, I let her breath



From debated on, to waited on

From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on

Cause we are, Young Movie stars

Cause we are, Young Movie stars

Bitches ain't say shit to me but now they won't leave me alone

Used to walk the other way

And they calling my phone, cause my paper was looong

Nothing, they ain't singing my song

Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along

We flying up, now you want me to take it all off

Want me to take it all off



Tell a bitch I'm a ball and I'm a buy a new crib for my niggas n all

Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all

Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall

Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star

To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on

Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown

Have any nigga in the World but she chose us

I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us

Get you to buy us a drink than it's over cause

We back around the time that she sober'd up

Shit ain't been the same since the limosuine showed up

The best moments of my life

Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life

Rarely gon to see, smoking with ya wife

It's the way we know, wake up in the morn'

Like ""where did all my paper go""

Grow some more weed and get medicated

Everyday is a holiday so we celebrated

I told you that I'm moving on

You didn't well it's hard to know



[?] I admit it was my mission

But everything went wrong there

'Cause you started acting different

The day you ran up on me I was smoking

Chillin' swore you was trying to roll, ain't know it was so appealin'

Fast forward I'm on the road

You at home calling me back forth

Can't do with this relationship

But this what you asked for

Asked for them pictures of them bitches shit

I probably wouldn't be with 'em

If your shit ass wasn't trippin'

Not to mention you're acting like a kid

It's the fuck shit I gotta deal with

Send a text leave me a message try not to listen

Bring the ref' you was the main player I had to bench you

When I showed your ass how to ball

That Louie I bought it all



[Chorus""]

I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl

Every night you keep calling me with the same shit

I'm going insane

I swear I love you but this ain't right for us

I never thought it would end this way

It's gonna kill me to say this but you gotta



Pack your stuff leave my keys

Get your shit gotta go

Pack your stuff leave my keys

Get your shit gotta go

Pack your stuff leave my keys

Get your shit gotta go

I told you that I'm moving on

You didn't well it's hard to know



Gone on the road, and I'm hardly home on the weekend

You'll be blowing my phone up tryin to see who I'm seeing

But I'm chasing this paper so for this paper I'm reaching

Might fuck one or two bitches but don't consider it cheatin'

I considered the fact I will break up anyway, anyway

Based on all that shit you don't appreciate

Me switching states, working hard meetin and dates,

You were thinking everything was sweet piece of cake

Well that all change, what we have is big

But you're gonna miss the small things

And that little cash I spent that was small change

But above all things I still love you

Just gotta do my own thing



[Chorus:]

I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl

Every night you keep calling me with the same shit

I'm going insane

I swear I love you but this ain't right for us

I never thought it would end this way

It's gonna kill me to say this but you gotta



Pack your stuff leave my keys

Get your shit gotta go

Pack your stuff leave my keys

Get your shit gotta go

Pack your stuff leave my keys

Get your shit gotta go

I told you that I'm moving on

You didn't well it's hard to know



Go, I'll never come back

Now when you call I'll never call back

'Cause I got a new girl, yeah I got a new girl

Everything was all good, then went all bad

You know I don't think about the time that we had

'Cause I got a new girl, yeah I got a new girl"

I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me
I woke up and wasn't no one there, yeah eh eaah
same song to a different beat
cause sometimes I feels like I'm the only one there
I guess nobody cares, hey

but everythings good until it goes bad

and your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have

it hurts when it don't last

no easy way saying bye

so I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky

and I fly solo

I fly solo

and I fly solo

and I fly solo

and I...



[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]

I'm tired of being tired

and dealing with your BS,

all the while supplying

the money for your request

without me you're a dime

but with me you're a buck fifty, haha

I can get another one quickly

but I'd rather wade it out

take the broken pieces try and fix it

lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com

or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision

and I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit

ha



[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]



[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]

Remember what you said

but what you say to me aint guaranteed to always be the Gospel

I was doing good way before I met you

now you're off the set

and I'mma let you see the show go on without you

take a bow...think about it

and hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it

see you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes

the story of my life, you're just another page,



[Chorus 2]

but everythings good until it goes bad

and your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have

it hurts when it don't last

Where we goin' next week I let my hoes choose
No socks in my boat shoes
Guess a nigga eatin' good like Whole Foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ridin' with me, so she pose too

See me and my guys like a plane flown through

Hella high, roll the weed up like I'm supposed to

And now I'm into big things

Own the building, you need to know the tenant rate

Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt

Let a bitch give me brain call it homework

Niggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work



A lotta shit done changed

New clothes, new car, new thangs

The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up

That’s what they say

Used to not be allowed in the building

But now we on the rooftop

Used to not be allowed in the building

But now we on the rooftop



Slow money just as bad as gettin' no money

But learn to get good show money, that's your money

Get comfortable with it, really know money

Rich nigga shit, that really goes for me

Self made nigga, well played

I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade

You tryna copy what's been done, I'm tryna innovate

And club owners gettin' tired of tryna ventilate, big mistake

I'm too busy findin' places and trips to take

The more I smoke the more money my business make

Remember they used to be like who is this?

Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day

When you around the real, you keep it real everyday

My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say

Either you gettin' paid or you payin' to play

Either you on your grind or you stay out the way



A lotta shit done changed

New clothes, new car, new thangs

The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up

That’s what they say

Used to not be allowed in the building

But now we on the roof top

Used to not be allowed in the building

But now we on the roof top



Just made a million, got another million on my schedule

The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless

You niggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did

They hatin' was the fuel for this shit

So you wrote your own check off a ho ass

Sweatin' bullets at home, wonderin' if she comin' back

Whodi you a simp and she can smell it on ya

That's why you only see her when you buyin' stuff for her

We was sneakin' in then it was general admission

Now we own the arena decidin' who allowed in it

My windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'

Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin'

We plotted this out, one night in the city

Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twistin'

Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it

TwitPicin' when we get it and they mad at us, fuck them niggas



A lotta shit done changed

New clothes, new car, new thangs

The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up

That’s what they say

Used to not be allowed in the building

It's hardly a secret
You ain't gonna stop trying get where you going until you reach it
Always had them bars back in the day
When the same ones runnin' up on you wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements

You work hard so it would be kinda hard hard not to believe that

You party every weekend

Fuck 'em all who act like they ain't seen a thing

All them nights on the plane, losses of nigga it took, had to charge it to the game

Always wanted stardom and the fame

Learn to out smart 'em and now it,

Ain't no stopping this champagne from popping

The drawls from dropping, I'm seeing muscle cars and copin' 'em

Started off just a little less popular



[Chorus:]

Now you got a new place, you drive a new car

You smile for the cameras, and life like you're super star

Don't care what they say you reach for the stars

Got everything you always dreamed and thought about

And everyone knows who you are



Never gets boring, them haters in your face you just ignore them

Don't know what they talking shit for

See niggas get theirs you just trying to get yours

Therefore, you left all the people you cared for

Hopped on a plane, got airborne

Seen the bullshit coming and fell for it

But it's all good now 'cause the same ones who talk shit

Telling everyone you made it,

Then you start seeing whose you dated

And thoughts start getting jaded

Now your life is sorta different, ain't it

Do your scars know what your pain it

But was it all worth, if it's painless

Say you wanna be famous



[Chorus:]

Now you got a new place, you drive a new car

You smile for the cameras, and life like you're super star

Don't care what they say you reach for the stars

Got everything you always dreamed and thought about

And everyone knows who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, who you are, oh



I always knew I was this good

But never knew I'd be this good

Them niggas just start I've been doing it

Hear 'em talk about but they ain't living my life

In the dark trying to get in my light

But chances I don't get them guys twice

Spending grands for hoes this is a highlight

And for them cameras posing this is the high life

Bottles raising for my niggas not here, I pour out a couple sips

Pour 'em out on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips

Them days I was younger I knew life was the shit but never like this

It's so amazing Will got it done, shots, we just pour and chase them

And worry about it cause they gonna hate, know where I'm going

Look where I came from



[Chorus:]

Now you got a new place, you drive a new car

You smile for the cameras, and life like you're super star

Don't care what they say you reach for the stars

Got everything you always dreamed and thought about

And everyone knows who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

The ladies ain't want give me no play.

The haters ain't have nothing to say.

They never let me into the club.

The radio ain't show me no love.

Gave my all but it just wasn't enough.

Ain't complaining, it was just how it was.



And now I'm just posted,

I started comin' up in the game.

And people started knowin' my name.

They tried to put me into that lane.

Then we had to go our seperate ways.

Instead of fussin' and flippin' out,

I did my thing and figured it out.

Security trippin', I ain't puttin' it out.

Smokin' loud.



And all my people's got,

champagne, fast cars, by the bar, wasted.

Potent marijuana.

That aroma make her wanna taste it.

Horses in my car, little Louis' on my bracelet.

When you live just like a star, it feel so amazin'.

If you rollin' with the gang, then you rollin' up another plane.

I let that bad bitch twist.

Travel the world, countin' up faces

Jump in my car, roll up and face it

No, I don't call, I'm on her faces

All of 'em model, none of 'em basic

Girl, I'm a star, look in amazement



Top of the game, that's where my place is

Started off small, runnin' from cases

Can't take it back, I can't erase it

Money got long, I'm tryna chase it

Puffin' the J, I wanna get paid

It's one and the same, but that's every day

I'm livin' my life as real as I say

I spent it all once, so I'm tryna save

I'm rollin' that dank, she pourin' that drank

I'm out of my brain, weed got me all faded

Lovin' my life, I'm never gon' trade it

I want success, don't wanna be famous

Know how to stay on your grind, it's contagious

Rollies with diamonds for time that it's takin'

People these days, they easily change

But I stay the same 'cause life's what you make it



I started off slow, but I finally made it

No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'

Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'

Travel the world, countin' up faces

Jump in my car, roll up and face it

No, I don't call, I'm on her faces

All of 'em model, none of 'em basic

Girl, I'm a star, look in amazement



Where is my mind? It's far away

Up in the sky, I'm high today

Break it on down, then we rollin' it up

I can see my house from up here

Who needs a jet when you're fly like me? Tell 'em

You don't need a jet to get high like me



From the sun up to the sundown

No, we never come down

Bobby Boy loud when he come around

Drivin' down Malibu

Stay driven like the valet do, I be cruisin'

Steady winnin', but I'm playin' like I'm losin'

I know that this shit can be confusin'

Talkin' rap, talkin' life, talkin' choosin'

Money over happiness, abusin'

Losin' your mind, losin' your heart

Second that I wake up, I feel like this world just wants to tear me apart

But I don't

Let it get me down, let it fuck me up

What my therapist say

They don't matter, no way



I started off slow, but I finally made it

No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'

Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'

Travel the world, countin' up faces

Jump in my car, roll up and face it

No, I don't call, I'm on her faces

You don't need a jet to get high like me



I started off slow, but I finally made it

No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'

Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'

Travel the world, countin' up faces

Jump in my car, roll up and face it

No, I don't call, I'm on her faces

All of 'em model, none of 'em basic

Girl, I'm a star, look in amazement



Top of the game, that's where my place is

Started off small, runnin' from cases

Can't take it back, I can't erase it

Money got long, I'm tryna chase it

Puffin' the J, I wanna get paid

It's one and the same, but that's every day

I'm livin' my life as real as I say

I spent it all once, so I'm tryna save

I'm rollin' that dank, she pourin' that drank

I'm out of my brain, weed got me all faded

Lovin' my life, I'm never gon' trade it

I want success, don't wanna be famous

Know how to stay on your grind, it's contagious

Rollies with diamonds for time that it's takin'

People these days, they easily change

But I stay the same 'cause life's what you make it

From the sun up to the sundown

No, we never come down

Bobby Boy loud when he come around

Drivin' down Malibu

Stay driven like the valet do, I be cruisin'

Steady winnin', but I'm playin' like I'm losin'

I know that this shit can be confusin'

Talkin' rap, talkin' life, talkin' choosin'

Money over happiness, abusin'

Losin' your mind, losin' your heart

Second that I wake up, I feel like this world just wants to tear me apart

But I don't

Let it get me down, let it fuck me up

What my therapist say

They don't matter, no way



I started off slow, but I finally made it

Pittsburgh pimpin' blew up and now he got his own strain
Diamond everything
We tired of paying for it so we put it in our name
To the top, but where we came from is way different
Been a boss and gon' remain

Know the cost, I can't complain

I'm back and rolling joints bigger than ever

The more time I take, the better I get

The more chains I cop, the wetter she get

All bullshit aside but never forget

Heard boss shit before but never like this

Blowing O's in my whip

Writing flows, bringing pounds where we ain't supposed to

But they don't even trip

Name on the list, we don't wait 'til it come out

Might buy every one so they don't exist

Rollie on the wrist

Competition try and miss

Diamonds on my fist

Gotta rock the coldest 'fits

Glad you noticed, never seen nothing like this so they focus

Mixing my new shit with my old shit

White diamonds on gold

We fell in love with how the money fold

Hundred millions I done sold, changed souls with the stories I told

Take it as a compliment when them younger niggas tell me that I'm getting old

That mean my money mature

Villas on shores, having conversations with billionaires

Skip the awards, we already there

Just keep the chronic smoke in the air

Model chick with long hair wearing weave cause it's easier to maintain

My niggas come from hunger pains

Now we all rocking two or three chains, Versace everything

Spilling our drinks, pulling out minks

Live a life that's as real as you think



It take a lot to keep a crew alive

Really socialize

Beef shit, we don't vocalize

Keep it in overdrive

Come through and catch a vibe

Bitches is over fine

G's up, stay cheesed up, smoke it then re-up

It takes a lot to keep a crew alive

From counting twenties and fives

To private jets when we flying

They can't believe us

It take a lot to keep a crew alive

So we keep the bottles on ice

Staying down, still cursin' to Jesus (What?)



So if I tell you something, I meant it, man

I'm not just doing this shit for my motherfucking health

I ain't got time to waste

You know that old ass saying, ""Time is money?""

Well I got a whole lot of money

And I don't got a whole lot of time

So don't mind me if I change that up

Let me sit



Paper been sitting up, just collecting dust

Though my Bentley clean as fuck, super sharp

Your bitch got cut, you mad but

You need to analyze the game that you laid

Had hella cracks in the frame, foundation was weak

She peeped early you was a lame

And proceeded to deplete your change

Smoking weed with my gang

Track suit tailored to feature my watch and bracelet

My reputation speak for me, I don't really say shit

Killer whales tip the scale, major sales

They praying that we fail though the real prevail

The illest niggas

Them haters really just wishing they could kick it with us

I swear that's why they so mad

Chevrolets candy painted, laid on the Ave

Hitting switches, drag the ass, sparking like a lighter

Million dollar rap writer, full time low-rider

A New Orleans East Sider

All my weed designer, all my hoes'll open fire



Yeah"

I'm tryna bag one when I spin through

On the grind, gettin' money's not a issue

You know it's the bomb just by the scent

It made me a boss and my whole team official

We just stickin' to the script

Niggas sayin' they get down but I promise they don't do it like this



'Bout to take another trip

Tell my bitch roll another zip

And my gang don't slip

Smoke trees, count a mil' before I dip

So much that the bank can't fit

She chose up, you can't blame her

We in the room high as a sky scraped

We came this far ain't gon' change up, homie that's Taylor



Straight gang, what I give her

Big crib but I made it out of Pittsburgh

No time for the fuck shit

We pull up, cleanest niggas at the function

All white Benz lookin' for some skins

Make sure I got room for you plus your friends

Straight card, no cash

Heard them niggas be simpin' so them niggas ain't lastin'

Get a joint and put gas in

Them niggas ain't even in my way, I move past 'em

Everything I make classic

And niggas be hatin', but to me that ain't natural

Million dollar conversations, product placement

Trying to keep up but they out of date

Out of breath, out of line, all the way out of shape

Bank account look like what the lottery say

Any time of day

Put a couple low-riders in your face

Wan' go, but she probably stay

Running game how it ought to be played

Ten years, ain't nobody take a shot at me

If it ain't cruise life, don't try to ride with me

One in the back, one on the side of me

In and out like a robbery

We here right on time hater, relax

Wakin' up neighbors for a couple months so I stacked

Taylor Gang jet life, fill our walls up with plaques

Leadin' by action, rollin' weed up in a classic

Relaxin', leave the show with too much cash to spend

Get back to the pad

Remember days when niggas was doin' bad

Now our girls look like they doin' Ad's

Wasn't into sports

But all my chains look like your phone flashin'

New estate, the gate automatic



What I'm smokin' got me feelin'

Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight

And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'

The Taylor way is how I live my life, on God

What I'm smokin' got me feelin'

Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight

And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'

The Taylor way is how I live my life, on God"

Shorty want the pleasure but it come with pain

Hard to tame and blessed with a lot of game

Keep the kush under a flame

The grind was a slow process but well worth it

Now they nervous, shit get way deep under the surface

I traveled all around the Earth and never missed a day of work

You fallin' off, I'm keepin' it more player

Smoke one flavor

Parkin' my low riders, pissin' my neighbors off

Been in the game way too long and ain't take a loss

How you showin' up to work late and think you a boss?

Less time spent on waitin' on someone else

The sickest, my nigga, ain't no remedy

Stay on the grind, ain't no plan B

You hustle hard, you understand me?

Roll up the plants

Stuffin' them hundred dollar bills in my pants

She ran out of luck, last chance

Ahead of my time, way too advanced

Wondering what my new shit gonna sound like

Rolling kush by the pound

Ain't tough 'less your niggas is around

Still underground

With thirty mil' a year, how that sound?

My son straight so I ain't gotta worry 'bout much

You out of touch

Money straight, pile it up

I can buy what I want

I ain't takin' her out on a date, no way

Sunshades, brighter days

Rollin' kush up, buyin' them J's

You niggas more into biting

Less talking, more writing

Sometimes other people won't understand

Soaking up some vibes, workin' on my tan

Another show, another two hundred grand stuffed in the safe

There ain’t no comparison to my watch and the one you wearin'

Weed so loud, you hear it

Pull up and we the ones they wanna stare at

Fuck an appearance

You hear us talk it then we really live it

Houses with tanks, fifty thousand dollar fish up in 'em

My team was built to win

Hit your broad with that venom

Pro clubs and Levi denims

Gettin’ mine to say the least

Put it down, she tell me I'm a beast

Soon as 2009 get released

We got more heat for the streets

Fuckin’ up her sheets, 100K a week

Rich but I stay discreet

You know how them major players be

Tell her she can stay or leave

Can't believe, but we really achieved it

Bars are seamless

Money large, wrist anemic

I ain't there unless my team is in it

Ain't nothing new, we been here a minute

Trips to Spain and Venice just to handle our business

Don’t leave a thing unfinished

Champagne with our dinners

Only multiplyin' addition, no division

Drive the coldest edition, got it out the mud

Models hoppin' out our showers and tubs

Dealers be givin' us ounces just because, showin' us love

Come and kick it with some niggas who don't empty guts

They broke, so they envy us

Laughin' to the bank while these suckers so serious

You ain't a boss, let me talk to your superior

Leather interior, bet I don't marry her

Year, gearin' up for success in different areas

Niggas was lost, switched the criteria

Hard not to stare at us

Think she home, but she here with us

Gettin' that kush smoke in her hair and stuff

Thirty thousand feet in the air

Always been and will be prepared for any affair

No diamonds in my teeth, but that's all I wear

Solataires by the pair, been ballin' my whole career

The carpet had burn holes, nigga, we was in there smoking

And thinking on how to grab us some mid

Me and my dog was close to going half on a chopper

And like a pound of weed and just lockin' in and gettin' it

But then lightening hit

Wasn't trying to change the world

But we fucked around and did it

Kept all my cars, but I kept trading in woman

Neon lights spell out my company name on the side of the building

It's going down in my life, baby girl, but I really be chilling

Reminiscing, lost wages, bum deals

I should've ran magnifying glasses on them pages and that's for real, yeah



Some of them supposed to go, some of them supposed to stay

I ain't tryna ruin yours, I'm tryna make a way, yeah

I be at the top, that's my favorite place

That money gonna come, I don't gotta chase it

Them bitches gonna come, I don't gotta chase em

I'ma keep getting love, I don't gotta chase it

Diamonds in my chain, watch, and my bracelet

Got love for all my dawgs, I don't gotta chase it



Give it all back to my son, millions plus one

I don't do 'less it's fun, to focus the funds

I remember taking trips with weed in the trunk

Now police don't even trip when we rolling up

Legal stunts, got a pound with each our name on it

Setting up the family, that's the main focus

Game polished, did our best to keep these lames off us

Turned down what the labels offer

Now everything in our name

Influenced the game with our slang

Its all a hundred percent, never changed

All my niggas stay solid as the friend

You broke, won't never fix you again



Some of them supposed to go, some of them supposed to stay

I ain't tryna ruin yours, I'm tryna make a way, yeah

I be at the top, that's my favorite place

That money gonna come, I don't gotta chase it

Them bitches gonna come, I don't gotta chase em

I'ma keep getting love, I don't gotta chase it

Proceed with care, the set keep trees in the air

No need for VIP passes, my whole team in the clear

Up and down the street

Run to the money, can't nothin' else get me on my feet

Hustle is all I know, spend it and get some more

I'm stayin' on the go, hopin' it don't get slow

I'm on the paper route with my folk

Ain't part of this game, a joke

Wrap it up like a brick of coke

Call a play like a give-and-go

Ballin' for real, toss an alley oop off the pick and roll

Rollin' hundred spokes gold, my Rolex frozen

Have you ever seen a quarter of a million dollars rollin'?

Bein' drivin' like it's stolen, by a stoned stoner

One of the originals who showed you fools how to turn the internet rhymes into residuals

I put away a whole lot of loot and stayed true, that's what we do

Make it easy to choose, so guess what?

You wonderin' why she gettin' all dressed up

You in the house, messed up, all stressed, for what?

Hustle is the only thing gon' keep your lights on, fuck love

Blow so much marijuana smoke the smell's still in the ceiling

Owner said the club closed but we still in the building

Pullin' foreigns outside and stuffin' women up in 'em

Keep a closet full of unpopped tags

Win some lose some, my car ill as they come

I'm putting it right on the street

You know what's going down when Taylor Life (East side), Jet Gang hook up with monster beats



Audio dope supply the needs

Fiends itching, sniffing for new audio feeds

This how it outta be

More often, too stoned hired up bosses with good intentions to see each other winning

Taking no shorts or losses but I know that we a rarity

Something they'll never see

'Til our sons click up and commence to hustling heavily

Sacrifices made, now we sitting in them better seats

And I ain't even watching the game

I just came to floss this outfit, now I'm on national TV

Sitting court side playing my Nintendo Switch

With a Nike headband fresh from 1996

Kicks sick, collection quarantined

Bed stock, 23's on some bathing apes I'm sure you haven't seen

Every verse is like a key

Could turn you to a boss if you don't know D (OG)

Drunk on power, gold bathroom fixtures and marble showers

Keep it in

Chevy gon' switch a nigga, we smoking weed in it

Horses in my bet

Porsches growlin' loud, big money portions

You made it off the porch, I let nature run its course

Play the game hard as a sport, we up and down the court

In the field, shit is real, houses in the hill

Hunded dollar bills fallin' out the sky, keep the liquor chill

Chrome grills, insides clean, that's just how we live

Quick to make the paper appear

Keepin' that weed smoke up in the air

Chicks be the baddest and my kush above average

And my eyes so low, soon as I walk in

I got a joint rolled you know that imma spark it

That's why I ride so slow, me and my gangsters

I won't leave here alone, came here with no bitch

But when I walk out the door, I might leave here with your bitch



Uh, they ain't goin hard as us

We courtside, chillin', smokin' out the building

Regardless if authorities give us permission

Boss bitches niggas breakin' they credit card limits

To try to ball with us

We in talks with those who only own business

My spark lit, then I paint pictures

Don't leave witnesses, nah nigga, my gang different

Pull the Benz out in the rain

Hit her once, I won't even remember her name

Hella diamonds up in my chain

To say that I'm dope is an understatement but no, I ain't underrated

Came from a place where niggas make their own way

Got some girls who fuck me but got niggas so they don't say

I'm puttin' KK in the paper

On point gang, ready for danger

Long joints, rollin' them things like broken fingers

Too clean to ever have a stain

Khalifa the boss before you beat the game

Tired as a mo' fucker
(Uh)
It was 2009
And I was just gettin' home off tour

Doin' hella shows for my fans

And I could tell that everybody want more

Ain't ever wait for nobody

We kicked through that front door

And always did our own thing

Can't tell you niggas wanna front for

We bought cones and stuffed more

Past girls, you cuffed yours

Spent nights on the airplane goin' too hard, like what for?

And all I did was make time

But I ain't take enough for myself

Just doin' shit for everybody else

I ain't hardly even by myself

Family time is slowed down

Cause they want me to burn out

Seen the end of this movie

They don't know how it turns out

Say they all gon' still love me if I don't make another hit song

If I don't take time to embrace it, what's the point of doin' this for?

I'm packin' up my bags

Book a night, another hotel

It's a lot that could go down

So I'm hopin' everything goes well

Came in to this game

Givin' rules to you lames

Be the one that's holding you down

Tryna count you out, it's a shame



And that's fucked up

But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay

It was 2014

And I was 'bout to go world tourin'

You was all up in my face

Sayin' that you want more

And I was gettin' tired

Of frontin' for the public

Sayin' I could do without it

But you seem like you love it

I remember all of the subjects

That we would argue 'bout day and night

Do the best that I can

No matter what, I can make it right

When you said you felt single

I remember like it was yesterday

How the fuck you hold me down

When you ain't take my last name

I tried hard to move past things

Came home, made shit change

Had to make a hard decision, let you go, it's time to do what's best for me

We went to Colorado, we was there for your friends' wedding

I was tryin' to hold it together

But I felt like we were ending

I remember the beginning

But this ain't nowhere close to that

Seen some shit you didn't like

Said some shit that wasn't facts

Never thought 'bout gettin' back

By puttin' your business out

In the end you made it seem like I ain't the one who held you down



And that's fucked up

But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay

(Be okay, be okay)

(Be okay, be okay)

And that's fucked up

But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay

(Be okay, be okay)

(Be okay, be okay)



We ain't hurtin' no mo', we ain't fighting no mo'

Cause everything, cause everything is okay

We ain't hurtin' no mo' (I swear), we ain't fighting no mo' (no)

Cause everything, cause everything is okay

We ain't hurtin' no mo' (we ain't gotta hurt no more, bro), we ain't fighting no mo'

Cause everything, cause everything is okay

We ain't hurtin' no mo' (no), we ain't fighting no mo' (nah)

It was 2017

The day before my son birthday

The week before my mom birthday

That's the day you passed away

Can't feel too bad because I know I see you again one day

But right now I can't help but feel this pain



And that's fucked up

But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay

Cause you too busy livin' out what you see in the portrait

All the things you involve with

Are just the smallest problems

I ain't gon' need the pardon

And I'm just being honest

You need to take some time to yourself and think about it

Grow up, you're being childish

I wanna see you balance

Don't think you're being challenged

I can count up a mil on a bad day

She ain't down then she ain't got no use

By the way that she making that ass shake

I just told baby do what she do

She the type I got to search for

Wasn't handed to me, had to work for it

They riding the wave like a surf board

While the boy hotter than the earth core

Told her wait til' I go get my cash right

When the money was low she didn't act right

Caught up living in the fast life

To be the boss I paid the mad price

I be [with some women] watching Friday

Smoking spliffs on the highway

Shawty call me royal highness

'Cause I did this shit my way



If you don't know by now

I don't like driving, baby, auto-pilot

Never let the plane go down

Forever on some fly shit

Yeah, I got it vibing

Baby girl knows my sound

I'm your royal highness

Baby going fast for me

Then I tell her slow it down

I ain't really worried about

When my time gon' come

'Cause I know it's now

I been really grinding

Baby, come find me

Gotta let me know you're down

I don't like driving, baby, auto-pilot

Never let the plane go down

Forever on some fly shit

Yeah, I got it vibing

Baby girl knows my sound

I'm your royal highness

Baby going fast for me

Then I tell her slow it down



Real expensive, my clothes

I'm reinventing flows

Presidential, my smoke

You guys are little clones

Go 'head and wash your self up

The only loud smell should be the dope

Everything else is top shelf

Didn't run a bowl, smoking a joint

I call that time to kill

Pound trip, I let shit slide

But niggas 'round me will

5k niggas at town

The owner paid to fill best seats

We at the game, I'm ashing on the field

Soon as we board the plane, they screwing up they faces

Money in cases, old watches, colorful bracelets

Some of us famous

The others just started they come-up



If you don't know by now

I don't like driving, baby, auto-pilot

Never let the plane go down

Forever on some fly shit

Yeah, I got it vibing

Baby girl knows my sound

I'm your royal highness

Baby going fast for me

Then I tell her slow it down

I ain't really worried about

When my time gon' come

But I came from underneath

Never tame me, I'ma beast

Watch my change increase

Used to just show up

But now I make them pay them fees

Used to smoke blunts

Now I need the paper

Being broke ain't in my nature

Either block out what they say

Or use the talk as motivation

Know sometimes they like a child and whine

And get impatient, but there ain't no complaining

Matter of fact, maybe she did
My momma raised a fool (haha)
But that don't mean we can't get rich
Too rich (too rich)
That's what they say



Humble beginnings

Rich ass endings

Pockets on swole

Big ass bingies

Started off losin'

Man it wasn't choosin'

Stuck with my nigga's

Now we all winnin'

Rollin' up paper

Ball like a Laker

Top on the building

I'm high as a 'scraper

What can I say now

Cops know my name now

No time to play round

I'm rich and I'm paid now

Stay on that piece for shit for nigga's that spray rounds

Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now

Try not to fade now

Try to find a way out

Nobodies innocent nigga

Get down or lay down

Made so much money but look how I'd paid out

Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house

Guess all these diamonds on my wrist

What u blinkin' about

It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about



Try to be the best that I can

They got the right decisions, handle the business like a man

You know I try to do shit with my heart

They talk but I don't listen

I just finish what I start

You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't

They got the right decisions, handle business like a man

You know I try when people say I should change

Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same



Nigga's still hating

Critics still weighting

Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases

But never said I'd stop counting these faces

Flyin' new places

Buying them cases

Nigga's want problems

I don't entertain it

Cause if it's real problems

It's not entertainment

I'm rollin' a joint up

Precise like a painter

The grind is what made us

The grind is what made us

Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer

Too much turnin' up

The club owners tryin' to censor

Tatted everywhere my full body full of scriptures

Pull up in the phantom

Paparazzi takin' pictures

Sellin' so much swag

We should be your swag vender

Big winner in the club, big cash spender

Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher

Some shit you can't witness

My nigga we been business



Try to be the best that I can

They got the right decisions, handle business like a man

You know I try to do shit with my heart

They talk but i don't listen

I just finish what I start

You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't

They got the right decisions, handle business like a man

You know I try when people say I should change

Let me roll this weed up and wrap this shit, you know
Too much purple for me
Uh, coming up I always thought I'd be the runner up
Gave my all but it felt like it wasn't enough

I remember spending summers in the studio

My pops told me have fun be a kid for once

What he ain't know, was for a kid a that I had big dreams

I take a small frame turn it into a big screen

Taking best friends turn them to a good team

I'm watching Scarface living all the good scenes

Burning dope thinking about the days when I was broke

Desperate niggas in my city don't know how to cope

Young nigga said he starving he ain't got a meal

Down to catch a body all about a dollar bill

My niggas is all I got so it's more than trust

We ain't even have a car we was on the bus

Public transportation now it's underground we make it

Throw it in the safe I can't hear what they say



I'm packing up my bags

Packing up my bags, packing up my bags

I gotta catch a plane

Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane

I can't be at home

Can't be at home, can't be at home

I gotta be away

Gotta be away, gotta be away



There's just way to many niggas i use to know back in the day

Now when i see them out

I just don't got shit to say to you niggas

When i see you in the club i make my way through you niggas

You must be mad i ain't wait on you

But no matter the circumstances i never get hate on you

Im just taking all my dream trying to make it facts

Putting on for my team trying to make it crack

Getting all sorts of green trying to make a stack

Lose yourself in my city and never make it back

Said he will but the chances are he will never change

Daddy sold dope but you would probably do the same thing

If i get $30K i would probably spend it on my wrist

Fuck these politics when these kids ain't have a pot to piss

Fuck the Promises, the shit I'm on is common sense

If you ain't talking them I'm gone



I'm packing up my bags

Packing up my bags, packing up my bags

I gotta catch a plane

Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane

Can't be at home, can't be at home

Plaques on the wall

My face on all the magazines

Kush in this jar I'm getting this cheese

Pants skinny rubber bands plenty

Whole team going hard like it's the last inning

Whole team going hard you got no chance of winning

Lot of seats on the floor lot of cash pinning

I play the game left hand like my man Jimmy

You just a right hand man call that man semi

Shades cover my eyes cause I be higher than most

Been on the plane for twenty hours, and wasn't tired

Live by the code, money power

How you think I win and copped that Rolls-Royce Corniche?

Turn around and bought a Maybach next week

A nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat

A nigga ain't paying fair, and life ain't cheap

Nigga ain't shit sweet but this box of swisher sweets

Ever since I was a youngin I was

Getting it in the streets

Now I'm on tour even getting it overseas

All the way in Switzerland stacking swisser-cheese

I ain't too good for that brown paper bag

I can still move that work and I get it off fast, hoe

God bless America, home of the brave

We ain't picking cotton no more but we're still slaves

They talk about peace, but how that's gon' be

When police leaving young niggas dead in the street

When niggas start shooting back, how they gon' act

And they wonder why a nigga stay strapped

They wonder why we trap, for real, real niggas don't rat

Black man, born with a target on his back

Standing with his hands up, screaming ""Don't shoot!""

Biggest gang in America, the boys in blue

Now we gon' ride, now we gon' loot

Cause that black man could have been me or you



Don't shoot!

Don't shoot!

Don't shoot!

Don't shoot!

Fuck the police, like Cube & Eazy-E

A nigga pay taxes and still ain't free

We just trying to get rich and ball out

Looks like the pigs trying to take us all out

We don't get justice, we just get handcuffed

They don't want to see a nigga get his bands up

Crooked judge just handing out sentences

Cause we're guilty until proven innocent

Standing with our hands up, screaming ""Don't shoot!""

Biggest gang in America, the boys in blue

Damn right we gon' ride and we gon' loot

Cause that dead black man could have been close to you"

Why you fuckin' with a nigga, huh?
Why you fuckin' with a nigga, huh?

Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga when you see him?

Why you fuckin' with a nigga when a real nigga right by there and you tryna leave him?

See him around in the club, see him buying out the bar, so the hoes tryna meet him

You can talk and make a nigga pay for it (?) you don't fuck the first night with me either



Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga?

Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga?



She ain't fuckin' with a real nigga

She ain't never seen a real nigga better (?)

Told him to me he a little nigga

He a little nigga, told me to (?) nigga

Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga?

Why you fuckin' with a nigga, huh?

Why you fuckin' with a nigga, huh?



Why you fuckin' with the nigga if he ain't comin' from the right hood?

And why you fuckin' with the nigga if he ain't ballin' like his ass should?

Why you fuckin' with a nigga if you know the nigga money ain't good?



Why you fuckin' with a nigga, huh?

Why you fuckin' with a nigga, huh?

I ain't fuckin' with the niggas

Nope, I ain't fuckin' with the niggas

I ain't fuckin' with the niggas

King of the dope? No!

Damn



Why you fuckin' with those niggas everyday when they ain't got no shit?

Why you fuckin' with them niggas?

I been 'em all, I can tell them niggas ain't lit long



Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga?

Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga?



She ain't fuckin' with a real nigga

She ain't never seen a real nigga better (?)

Told him to me he a little nigga

He a little nigga, told me to (?) nigga

Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga?

Why you fuckin' with a nigga, huh?

Why you fuckin' with a nigga, huh?

Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you
As you were brought into this world
You tried to find out about your surroundings
The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air
The smiles you see at that point are the ones you should always remember

Authentic is

Due to the choices you make for yourself

It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget

But some although not healthy for them will create an understanding of what the word real means

Us (?) one of your greatest attributes

Others before thyself as long as long as thyself is taken care of is well being

And money, well, I know you know how to get money

I'm gonna say this one time only, live young man, you deserve it

Let's celebrate, Blacc Hollywood



And we be in the club, buying all our champagne

Spillin' it on the couches

Me and my niggas deserve this shit

We was there for the come up

I am Blacc Hollywood, I live Blacc Hollywood



Yea, yea, yea

Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you drive the newest lookin' cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you brought a lot of draws cause she ain't lookin' for love

That's no love

That's no love

That's no love

That's no love

Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love



Pull up to the club with my thugs smokin' so strong

Hop out and walk through the back, so high I don't know where I'm at

Them bitches get open, I'm with some niggas who all 'bout that action

Poppin' them bottles, you look outside, see them foreigns

She get them dollars out them niggas cause she ain't lookin' for love

Smoke that loud up by the pound, she get champagne and drink it up

Hope you ain't a (?) cause she ain't lookin' for cuffs

In the club spinnin' (?), she in your face, you think it's love

Said you throwin' dubs, bro that ain't enough

Money, clothes, and drugs, that's what bitches love

Rollie cold as fuck, that's what bitches love

Back to the topic,



pop that ass and please don't stop it

Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you drive the newest lookin' cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you brought a lot of draws cause she ain't lookin' for love

That's no love

That's no love

That's no love

That's no love

Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love



That's no love, that's no love

That's your bitch, get her bed in my truck

You ain't give her what she needed, and she ain't lookin' for love

Homie she don't want no flowers, only make her cum



Poppin' ass, kinda naughty, met her ass at the party

Took her to the after party, drink some gin off her body

Spend some ends, now I'm going in

Took her and her friend, hit the skins

Then we smoked again, eyes like I'm Korean

Shots of gin, that's what all this juice is for

In Blacc Hollywood, that's my newest car

I'm like eney meeney, I got plenty

Pockets filled with hundreds, fifties

Nothin' lower, come fuck with a stoner



?

Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you drive the newest lookin' cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you brought a lot of draws cause she ain't lookin' for love

That's no love

That's no love

That's no love

That's no love

Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love

Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love"

Imma have my way with your body
And when I'm done touching you
I bet you won't wanna
Give yourself to nobody
Baby when the lights go out

It's like we're the only ones

And I already feel it now

It's like you're the only one

Only one who knows just how

How to make the time stand still

We're caught in the moment



So don't let me down

You made those promises

Don't take em back now

Don't let me down

Do all the things you said that had me going

Let's get caught in the moment

Let's get caught in the moment



Smoking one and rolling one

I come and break you down for fun

You love it when I get up in it

Kiss your body when I'm finished

My drop crotch is by Knomadik

My drop top is automatic

Put you in it, now you tweaking

I can nab you for the weekend

Rolling up and going up

I'm smoking weed and pouring up

I take that money, hold it up

I take your legs and fold em up

I take my time, I break it down

I tell you not to make a sound

I take that KK and pass it round

Your clothes keep dropping to the ground



So don't let me down

You made those promises

Don't take em back now

Don't let me down

Do all the things you said that had me going

Put it in a joint, not a blunt

Don't disrespect mine, player

This not the two, this the one

Don't even need a scale

Back in high school I used to be the weedman

Quarter ounces, half ounces, what you need, man

Eleventh grade, made my way up to a P, man

And sent it back if I ever seen a seed, man

And you don't even gotta ask

You know it by the smell

I treat every day like it's a payday

I got KK in my pipe, pockets fat like Kelly Price

If you wanna take a hit you can't be afraid of heights

You gon' need some new lungs, rolling up a blunter for em

While I'm smoking out the bong getting sucked like a thumb

Boy I'm in a daze, tangerine haze

I smoke so much KK they should've called it Juicy J

Bombay and lemonade, weed get the lemon taste

Never hit the bong, let me demonstrate



Go and roll it, chief and choking, marijuana, reefer smoking

Trap the semi sum under reggie foot up in his colon

Call the doctor, call the clinic, bullshit we staying with

Your life ain't worth a motherfucking quota, what you paying with?

Khalifa kush a hundred pounds, that's a half a mil

Memphis streets so eat this like a baby, like Enfamil

Lungs full of KK, have your mind on a runway

Blow my high, motherfucker, I'm a shoot up like an AK



My white house higher than Willie Nelson, on dabs the wax is melting

These clouds are smoking, help me, I'm flying like elroy jetson

I might bring a dispensary down in Tennessee

Whole pound of grandaddy, but he ain't no kin to me

(I'm staying with the greens light color)

Nigga, only the reals who I get my money with
Used to turn on the TV, see what I want
And now the same one I dreamed about, the same one I'm stuntin' in
In the 6-2, almost 26
And every nigga that I'm with got a zip

I look at this shit as one big table and best believe every nigga I'm with got a sit

They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell it straight to the public

You young, black, then you thuggin'

What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin'

Who stuck to what he believed in and turned himself to something great

They should use that story to motivate

But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead

Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived

25 and not dead



I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real

When you work hard to get it that's how you feel

The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away

We started small to them houses in the hills

To them houses in the hills

Houses in the hills

Houses in the hills

To them houses in them hills



You make a little money, take care and right yourself

And people start coming up with they hand out

People take their stresses and make them yours

Well that's just what comes with being a man

I try to do all that I can to make sure that

My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through

But in life we all got our own path

Don't understand that by now you won't begin to

Cop another Rollex or Porsche try and get even with me

Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me

Cause we had so many cars it was stupid

So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me

Made a couple million (?)

They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom

Or how to make your people better by taking knowledge and spreadin' it

Not being in the game but ahead of it



I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real

When you work hard to get it that's how you feel

The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away

We started small to them houses in the hills

To them houses in the hills

Houses in the hills

Houses in the hills

To them houses in them hills



Thousand dollar benefit plates

No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place

Now I'm high, Empire State

Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace

I'm one of them under-celebrated greats

Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me

Soon as I stepped off the plane

Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine

Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne

I been in the crib enjoying my hobbies

Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me

Try me

Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy

I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran

Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in

Come out with the whole hen

A dollar and a dream

Have a house on the hill and the world on a screen



I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real

When you work hard to get it that's how you feel

The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away

We started small to them houses in the hills

We started small

to them houses in the hills

We started small

to them houses in the hills"

Smoking dearly departed

I've got so much, so much shit to do,
Don't even know where to start
Be here forever
I think that's the plan, you all know?
Start here, end up there

Soon as you think something's going on you start back over

It's never gonna be the same

I ain't complaining though

I really wouldn't have it any other way

Nigga



Every day you wake up

Your destiny depends on what you do

Sometimes I roll up when I'm stressed out

And sometimes I roll two

Here people saying shit about the way I am

But I know that ain't true

At times I feel like I'm all by myself and I know you do too

I made some phone calls and checked emails

Cause I'm always grindin

Ain't no rush, I do things slow cause it's all about timing

Some people think when you get to this point in life you've made it

I've seen so many settle for less,

That's when talent get wasted

I ain't there, but if I can I'mma try to be perfect

And for those that's riding with me,

I'mma try to make it worth it

I drink too much, I break my weed cause it's better for the stress

I just woke up, I don't get sleep, boy my schedule's a mess



Man I work hard

Man I work hard

Man I work hard

Man I work hard

It ain't no game ,no pain no gain

Ain't no gain without being no pain

Ain't no gain without being no pain

Ain't no gain without being no pain

No pain

Man I work hard



Just left another one

Just wrote another one

Just got another check

About to thumb through another one

Falling asleep on the plane

Them nigga holding it down,

Don't care if it make you uncomfortable

Hardly spend nights at the crib,

Homie that's just how I live

Don't even go hard for myself, I got a wife and a kid

I don't ever question the biz, nigga it is what it is

You niggaz ain't killin shit, no you niggaz ain't killin shit

What they doin it ain't nothin

Call my phone, it ain't nothin

I smoke a lot but don't judge me

Probably wake up earlier than all of you niggaz

Motherfuckers always hate on the squad,

But all the hating motherfuckers ain't get paid



Man I work hard

Man I work hard

Man I work hard

Man I work hard



It ain't no game ,no pain no gain

Ain't no gain without being no pain

Ain't no gain without being no pain

I ain't need no one my whole life, and I done alright

I can do bad by myself, these days you never can tell

But the people who been with me and they know who they are

When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it

And that green inside they hide, cause that's they true colors

When I pull up in that white on white, good God almighty

And that green inside my pocket, yeah, cause that's my true colors

That jealousy I can see in they face

That green is all that I make, call it fate

Or call me perfect with timing

Call me crazy, don't call my phone

Call me covered with diamonds

Cause I pull up in the white

Pull up with the black

Pull up in the back

Pull up with some niggas that be yellin' back

Have the hella best fans, hella wet sands, hella jet plans

Married to the game they don't need a best man

They know I'm a mogul for real

I branded a color, pink is the color

Can't wait to unveil the pink print cover



When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it

And that green inside they hide, cause that's they true colors

When I pull up in that white on white, good God almighty

When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it

And that green inside my pocket, yeah, cause that's my true colors



Always been, always was

The one who win, ain't tryna take a loss

Counting faces, spending faces

Being faceless, look at they faces

Real that's my true colors

Rich that's my true colors

If you a real nigga, let's get it, let's get it

If you a rich nigga, let's get it, let's get it

Bitch we dem boys, nigga we the Beatles

1-8-7 no appeal, get it how you live

Before I go broke accountants jump off a bridge

First round draft pick, hittas stay in the field

On that poor side of town, grinding to pay our bills

They hate to see you flourish, so I draw the curtains

I'm so high up in the sky that my I won't get no service

Democracy be the dope, community in the choke

The warden just caught his case, he was looking forward to vote

Nigga count your blessings, lighters on the dresser

I scoped it, a whole body, so yes I'm well invested



From Fig row to the airport to them Iceland hoes

Head to London then to Paris, double sold out shows

Then I fell asleep in my Saint-Laurent and woke up, stunt more

And just recent nigga, my teeth is nickel, got disco-ball glow

Niggas throwin' shots but I dodge 'em all, you can't touch this

The father of Destiny, Knight's pops, Will's man

Girl, I house you like the Jungle Brothers, understand

I shine before ya'll time

I been outside when T La Rock invented rhymes

When dinner time and BBS's on tinted Saab's was getting robbed

I'm 20 in, still outside, don't ask for it

Drinkin' by the case, that be the reason why they hate

Fresh up outta cell to the seats of private planes

Roll at least an ounce a day, smokin' weed is my escape

Peddle to the floor, make sure my niggas straight

Every city-state, I'm tryna break the piggie bank

Some niggas get put on, some niggas get played

Take another selfie, watch the lawyer beat the case

And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry bout the mix up

You ain't never had someone, you can never keep her

Tricking on the next man, he can't have her either...

I Call her Yoko Ono



[Big K.R.I.T:]

She should like that, kush it up and write back

When you send her messages talkin' bout a nightcap

She tell you she like rap

You tell her you might rap

She pretend your shit jammin', really you quite wack

She just want a nice bag, wrist game, ice pack

Prada clutch, price tag

What you spend? twice that

Put her in the game cause you hoping she'll hype that

So you can go along, OD, catch a spike that

You can never wife that

Never ever pipe that

Good enough to make her settle down

She ain't like that

Punch a nigga in the mouth, dare a nigga fight back

Roll a nigga weed up and ask him where the light at



[Hook:]

Call em Yoko Ono

Only ride solo

Mission for the dolo

One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive

She's a man eater, ski mask diva

She might up 'n leave you, but you can never leave her

You ain't never had someone, you can never keep her

Tricking on the next man, he can't have her either...

I Call her Yoko Ono"

This what dreams are made of
Good weed and cold drinks
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
Thanks for putting this together Jerm!
We gon be here forever

And you ain't trippin

Really this high



[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]

If you offer me all the money in the World

I wouldn't trade it for my girl, my family

Or the niggas that you see me riding with me outta town

Or internationally, they gon fly with me, kinda fry?

Rollin the papers so they get high with me

And if I decide to give this up they gon retire with me

Enjoy the money and the fame and the power with me

And fucking hater burn in hell

Sippin champagne while the waiter breaking shells

Niggas scream my name probably praying that I fail

The money so insane gotta weigh it on a scale

Gotta weigh it on a scale?

Niggas blow that, bitches know that

Never touch blood, chill with us once, never go back

Little homie, that's real

VVS diamonds, my stones are that I'll

My watch is an Audemar on smoking OG till my problems gone

You try and call your man he ain't got no more

Probably cause I bought it all



[Hook:]

As we proceed to court bad bitches and roll good weed

Fast livin, I'm taking them hoes on trips

Go to places they never been

I'm just gettin it how it's supposed to be

As we proceed to court bad bitches and roll good weed

Fast livin, I'm taking them hoes on trips

Go to places they never been

I'm just gettin it how it's supposed to be



[Verse 2: Curren$y]

Aquafina and the bong

I'm off in that medina when I'm done

Just sound the alarm, bitch top drop like Mardi Gras beads bein thrown

Francesca you's a mess girl, carry on

Car smelling like a pound when I pull up at the avalon

Pull your own weight I don't have no time for tag-alongs

Don't know what you yapping for, stacking dough

Catalogue my closet, my belts, my watches

Cell phone in my pocket

My Blackberry biotches

Have 'em ready, I'll watch em, daddy back

Niggas plottin' on the Jets but we got em

We just waiting to drop 'em

They vex cause we poppin'

And them hoes ain't worry 'bout 'em

They sure came up

What they sayin about them boys from the bottom?

Paparazzi cameras spot em

Flash when you see they faces

History in the makin

I was high when I made it so I can play it for them haters



[Hook]



[Verse 3: Big Sean]

Used to want a chain, now I got 6

Used to want a Rollie like Pac now it's on my wrist, woah

Livin' the life niggas told me was a myth (myth)

Same niggas try an' get up on my list (what)

Since I started buzzin', I got eighteen eleven cousins?

New bitches tryna join the team and old ones that I'm cutting

Sky high class livin but niggas still grinding

Cause I'm surrounded with the same niggas and girls since I had nothin'

Now, I got signed to my idol

Seen some of my favourite rappers turn rivals

'Ye told me kill em so a nigga gotta drop 'em

Peep the Jesus chain he gave me since I can't keep up with Bibles

No, young nigga heeding to the title

Where it's at?

That's the top man, these niggas gon recycle

What, my shit is like a B.I.G recital

But you can't hold a real nigga down that's why I keep real niggas round

You shouldn't listen to this
If you ain't talking Pittsburgh
If you ain't mention the prince

You pissed I get chips for this shit

This for my homies that be OT whip full of bricks

I'm on another level, dudes gotta catch up to my ride

I'm ahead of my time

I'm a threat to you guys, why?

I'm still a student, yet I'm fluent with my rhymes

Still that best of that good shit, professional hood shit

Bill Gates cake, I won't settle for hood rich

I'm fresh 'cus we don't sound like that other bullshit

My team hustle, no days off

And weigh so much salt? that you might have to take a snow day off

You ain't coming close to mine, if the cops bring a snitch about you

Me on my worst day is what you pricks amount to

Talk slick like the life we can't get about you

And have dirt on you like I have some shit about you

See Wiz Khalifa's like a teacher I could show you to

A spliff of reefer got me somewhere high up in the mountains

You claim to be S-T-A-R-S

But like your under 21 you can't f-k with my bars

Ask about me the streets think I'm the youngest in charge

Pimp too, leave the club with a truck full of broads

And if it's on then I'm crushing them all

You n-gas prolly right, when you say that I ain't f-king with' cha' 'ya'll, dog

I'm on a paper chase, moving unit state to state

So I let the haters hate, got about a cake to make

Money on the mind, moving at a greater pace

Hungry on the grind and I ain't eating of a paper plate

I need the finer things, came up on the rhyming game

Now they listening, take his picture in them designer frames

And they come with success some n-gas gotta hate

I see you playin with me, it's different, it's not a game

I'm moving heavy in the trenches

Best flow, back dow (door)

When I knock any n-ga senseless

I don't do much, smoke about a blunt or two or three

Gonna take more than a few bars to get through to me



Yeah I'm the prince

Thas what it is man

Show and prove man

That's the name of the game

Niggas blow money but I'd rather keep mine instead
Roll something nigga, blow something
Say you're ballin' out of control
Let a nigga hold something

Specially if you got in, and he don't put his niggas on

Tell me what's the sense in even having it for?

Cause when you're broke, you'll have everything to gain

When you lose it all...

Let you inhale out the vap'

Do it for the taste

Usually I roll one up, then pass around

But now I smoke it to the face

Cause chiefing with niggas is such a waste

Unless they my niggas, and 9 out of 10 times

They got their own pound with 'em

Own pack of papers and filters, on the ground

We be smoking them things like 6 at a time

5 in the L, 4 breakin' down

3 in my head, 2 on my mind, nigga

I keep more than one rolled...

A bit of a pothead

It has been said I keep one rolled up

Like LL's pants legs

Full of life in this bitch, though

I may seem half-dead

Trust me, I'm cool

I just ain't talking to you

And them Jet's coming through

It's just as I predicted

Got a bigger portion

Cause the Jet's eating off bigger dishes now...

Ain't that the biggest fish up in this pond?

Since life's a bitch, tell her roll my shit up, huh?

Secret compartment in my car, James Bond

Though I'm James ball nigga bread long

And my name known known in e'ry home household

Caught them pussies slippin' tryna squeeze

In the mouse, ho. That cheese is ""nachos""

You are not chose by the Gods

To live as we do, so play your role in the movie

Ain't no pause, no rewind

For no man, waste time

So I ain't wasting mine

Roll around with a bunch of get-rich ass niggas

Who the man? You ain't even gotta ask these niggas

I'm a fuck around and take these last 3 pictures

Man, these bitches breakin' their neck

Just to pass weed with us

We both get high, get drunk, more shots, reload

Too high, we know, 3 more, TeVo, we blow

Bitch, how could you be so fine?

Shake that ass, she's so mine

Taking more double shots than free throw lines

I'm might hit like 3-4 times

Go over a few things, then I'm a wipe this weed

Don't want any burn marks sweetheart

So hang it out the window, if you gotta

Fuck up once, I get you outta here

Bombay and high-grade liquor for my niggas

Never seen a ghost in person, cost me five figures

That's like fifty g's a person if you ridin' with us

To the sky's limits

Staying at the highest level but I didn't make it alone

Now that my money right them suckers keep thinking I'm wrong

And smoke weed with my niggas



Still rolling weed on my XXL

Only different is that's me on the cover

Once in a while call my little sister and tell her I love her

Cause she can get crazy in this industry

All your friends become your enemies

That's why I stay down with the ones that's still with me

The niggas who started and they down ? the end with me

Make sure the positive energy be flowing

All the weed keep rolling

All of us keep getting high, the sky

We gonna keep from falling

Niggas keep hating, but baby I'mma keep ballin

Now I'm buying a steak on

On private island vacations

Flying on private planes

I'm cool with the pilot, he let me roll something

Put on a movie, let my girl watch it

Ask my dealer how I look, that Ferrari option

Just an everyday life, when you young and bossin'

Sipping that purple stuff, twistin' the pretty leaf

Pull up in that Ferrari, this bitch in disbelief

On the road to the riches, 'nother crook in the castle

Only fuck with my niggas, pray we all livin' lavish

I pray we all livin' so lavish

I pray we all livin' so lavish"

When the song come on I'm spending money
There's something I can spend some money too
When the song come on I'm spending money
There's something I can spend some money too

[Wiz Khalifa:]

High debated but I'm highly paid, I just live my life

That shit you niggas trying to do

I guarantee I did it twice

They say life's a gamble, hit my joint and roll the dice

When you living this high, you can't be afraid of heights

Book my flight to vegas well, 20 tho to stay the night

Another 10 on champagne, my money long I pay the price

Tired of niggas saying they in my game cause dawg we ain't alike

I'm throwing money, when I walk up in this bitch, they know it's money

Money in my arms, another tables full of money

Pockets full of joints I rolled

Dropping ashes on my clothes (clothes)

Balling super hard, smoking till I over dose

Hardly ever sober bitch, we party till it's over



[Hook:]

When the song come on I'm spending money

There's something I can spend some money too

When the song come on I'm spending money

There's something I can spend some money too



Niggas always hatin' on me, talking bout ""I'm balling too""

Get your money up and quit your hating's what you oughta do

I been going hard since I was younger

When I was in my teens I knew when I got older I'll be on some now I do my things

Spending money, popping hella bottles, making niggas mad

Going places, rolling J's, I live the life you wish you had

Throwing up dollar bills, Dolce on my tags

Got a joint full of that OG

Got a clip full of them OG's



[Juicy J:]

Trippy nigga hit the club, you know I be fucked up

Chasing after the model chicks, trying to get my fucks up

Niggas handcuffing hoes, but them niggas know what's up

Y'all came to the club together, but that hoe gonna leave with us

Break at the blue dream, everybody rolling up

Hold the lean, hold the cups, hold it down then pour it up

Tell the owner we ain't leaving, we gonna buy the whole club



[Wiz Khalifa:]

Now my dollars to the ceiling and my card it got no limit



[Hook:]

When the song come on I'm spending money

There's something I can spend some money too

When the song come on I'm spending money

There's something I can spend some money too... [fade to end]"

Yeah! Ladies And Gentleman! [haha!]
I'd like to welcome y'all, to the life, of a star! Yeah, superstar that is, and that's me, Young, Wizzle Man! [haha!][yeah!]

Verse 1:



Little nigga, big money, big dreams

Tall nigga, small nigga, big team

Small team, 5 o' 1 fit jeans

Some say my life can't be all that it seems

Big things, big hoes wanna go back to my spot, they say how my shit gleams

Remember when I was a little nigga, fifteen, it's funny how I've grown, yeah my money kinda long

[yeah!]

And your girl know the words to every song, 'cause ima star

Different week, ain't no tellin' where we are, look up I might be gone

[yeah!]

The man goes to get that cash and, cash and, move it, I see through them lights flashin, flashin

Ain't no need to even ask it

Fuck the world, live erryday like it's your last

[yeah!]



Chorus:

No matter where you go,

They know who ya are,

Run up screaming, 'cause they know, your a superstar!

Your a superstar!

Your a superstar!

[yeah!]



Verse 2:

Got bright, grind hard, got paper

Got in the game and got more haters

My whole swag got grown, got tailored

Hop on a plane and talk to y'all later!

[yeah!]

This good weed man, my blunts not flavoured

My whole gang Gucci frame, Chuck Taylor

We ball hard like the majors

Probably 'cause we major!

You gon' have to front page 'em

Wild like a loose animal, they won't cage 'em!

Now I amaze 'em!

Everytime I answer a front center stage 'em!

Blame a nigga that pays 'em

Ridin' with a bitch body on her, that's Cajun

Couple hundred dollars on these Air Hardy's frames, believe me!

My future so bright, I need these, excuse me



Chorus:

No matter where you go,

They know who ya are,

Run up screaming, 'cause they know, Your a superstar!

Your a superstar!

Your a superstar!

You think you got the bond cause I rolled you a joint?
I smoke with all mine, baby girl whats your point?
Don't front
You in the back of a long line

Trying to get in cause only members inside

Trees get twisted up like fingers and gang signs

Purple kushes broke my fall

I fell from a grape vine

Super high, from the free throw line

I'm Drexler status, glide, ducking espionage

Many jelous eyes scrutinize the rise

But the jets in the house like the curtains and the blinds.

It hurts to see me shine that's why they frowning all the time

In they internet videos digital see befores

Angry orangutan I'm arranging my sneakers

I'm the action on the court

You the gum stuck to the bleachers

I think I'm Paul Pierce, I think I'm Rondo

High off the headband you dying on that hydro



Cuz we are... we are... super hiiiigh

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah



I thought of this fresh off a bong rip

My bitch next to me, getting undressed for me

Running bath water playing her favorite songs while I get another one lit

Don't usually smoke at all but you say tonight you'll take a hit that's understood

From the smell and by what I payed, you know its good.

Them niggas with me, they from the hood

Now we throw parties in the sky, I'm on the 42nd floor now thats super high.

Champagne, more paper planes than you could fly,

Them young niggas fail soon as they try

When the paparazzi flash

I be countin all this cash

Plotin a million and how to build a mountain out of hash, come on...



All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)

Put your eyes... to the sky, that's where you'll find meee (ooh ooh ooh)



Cuz we are... we are... super hiiiigh

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah



Rozay!!



I'm gettin money no Illuminati

My pain never went in vein it's all over my body

Hit the spliff in my Mr. Bugatti

Kick it with my little homies I'm Mr. Miyagi

I gotta buy my niggas each a pound

Tweakin up,??, pass the reefer around

Spittin only lethal rounds, speakers beatin down

Not talkin much as when I say my niggas eatin now

Promoter gave me 40 thou, I think we even now

Pina colada papers, smoke the garden of eden now

Taylor gang is what we bleed about, jet setters in places you only read about.



And now everywhere I go

It's so strong they ask me where I get my smoke

Bitches don't gotta guess they know

I keep one rolled up, we can do what ever you want

Smokin pina colada papers baby girl we don't fuck with the blunts... unless I'm with the boss



If your lookin for me you could find me in the Guiness book,

Only fly bitches ride with the boss take a look, I'm super fly...

I'm super high, you get yours, I'm getting mine



Super hiiiigh... super hiiiigh



Ay yo waitress, I need another bottle of that Rozay, I need another bottle of that Rozay,

I need another bottle of that Rozay, just order, just order, another bottle of that... rozay

I'm back, and those who didn't previously know what i'm crack
To the people, i'm legalized the lethal

We all got problems involving the root of evil

But they caught me non-dodging, long arming the people, yup!

And for the record, I ain't no half stepper

I rose from the city of steel, the streets greedy for real

Cats chasing their paper, thats basic

Mathematics, hate to run the streets but took a staff at it

As I look back at hard it seems

I remember when this music thing was all but a dream

But i'm here for my city

And can't name no one that's near fucking with me

Uh, get the cork out the bottle

Get that money up and make your style a lil harder to follow

I've been hustlin' all the time, that's the only thing I know

Now my watch is worth 30 thousand, got Cuban links and Italian

Boy I'm gettin' it

Ridin' in my ride lookin' filthy rich

Killin' these niggas I ain't innocent, my bad

Ain't paid the cost, see they just watch me then copy my swag

Say I fell off that's where you lost me

How's that when my name is in my upholstery

I'm rollin' up and goin' places across seas

Hopin' the neighbor don't smell the shit I bake

And every day I'm on another plane

I hardly sleep, but hey I wouldn't have it any other way



Now here we are, now there we go

You rollin' on to where we smoke it all today

Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go

Now here we are

I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane

Uh, so much money that when I pull up

Hop out and walk in the bank teller look at me funny

Know how much I get, know I'm liable to walk up in this bitch

Like Tony with big blue bags of this shit

And tell 'em, ""Count it up""

Ridin' round in that Cali got OG kush in my body

My nigga I keep it G and that's Gucci or that Giani

I'm gettin' dressed for the airport to pose for the paparazzi

Mo' money, mo' problems, not how I see, huh

Mo' money, mo' Roberto Cavalli, bruh

Damn, ain't it funny how time pass

[Intro:]
Talkin' big money, bitch, uh
That little shit you talkin' 'bout
That's lunch money

We don't even smoke that

And this shit gon' be like this for uh

Pretty much the rest of the time we here

My little niggas got more money than you fuck niggas man

I promise



[Hook:]

I got-I got-I got-I got so much

So much, so much, so much



[Verse 1:]

Quarter million, little nigga, I was nineteen

Had my hustle down pat, I did the right thing

They don't move that fast, they act like they don't like cheese

Had a couple niggas mad like they don't like me

Is it cause I'm hella paid? I think it might be

Yeah my pockets hella straight

And I smoke so much dope I got OG in my IV

So many niggas jackin' that shit don't even surprise me

I don't even want it back, shit it's off to the good

Can't even say I didn't know you would

Make a little money, get it from the bro

Bring that shit back to the hood

Anytime you see me, man I'm on the grind

Nigga wasn't workin' when you knew you should

Now you talk about me when I'm on the road

And when I ride by I'm in the newest one



[Hook:]

I got so much money I think I should pay for all this

They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'

I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'

Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin' [x2]

I got so much



[Verse 2:]

Big money

Even larger crib

No I ain't just stuntin'

That's how I'm supposed to live

I move fast paced

So I drive faster cars

Take a look outside

Those are really ours

And we're really stars

We all travel safe and go really far

In that custom paint, in that suede floor

In that California, that's really hard

In that California, that's what we on

Smell that strong, you know I'm baked

Chances dog, that's what we take

How much you hate, that's what we make

Roll up one, that's what we face

Lot of y'all claim that you real, gon' show up fake

But that shit don't mean a thing

Cause I'll still be on my grind

And stackin' all of this change



[Hook]



[Break:]

Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause

I got so much

Gin in my cup, twenty-two cones I'mma stuff

Lightin' another one up

(I got-I got-I got-I got so much)

Live it up, every dollar spend it up

Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause

(I got so much)

Gin in my cup, twenty two cones I'mma stuff

Lightin' another one up, cause



[Hook]



[Outro:]

Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys

Step up your game or step down

Whenever a problem troubles us all

If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow

For there's nothing too much for the great God to do

And all that he asks and expects of you

Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield

Confidence and knowledge that God knows best

And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test

But without God testin' of our soul

It never could reach the ultimate goal

So keep on knowing and believing

All that God has promised you would be yours to receive

Preach, Church, tabernacle

Wiz! Wiz! That's the way

Wiz! Wiz! That's the way

Wiz! Wiz! That's the way"

Sharing this money and trying to all of niggas up and off them streets

Used to look up some niggas, but now it all seem that it come down to me

Make sure my family gon' eat

Grinding from up underneath

Now they just say I'm a now they just say I'm a beast

And now all these haters looking at me pitifully

Baby I go, hard
So hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on my job
Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone

Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all

Cause we done made it, too far

Got something to say then fuck 'em

Ain't trying to lose out on all of this for nothing

I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'mma get

No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent

And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich

And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit

That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since

Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips...wit'

Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it

Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me

Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it



[Verse 2: Wiz]

And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring

Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me

Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you

Take you places where they using different language to greet you

Smile and shake when they meet you

Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get enough of me

Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me

Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me

Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want

And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me

Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'mma need it in a rush

None, these little young niggas try me today

Uh, cause between all of these closets and all of these boxes I got

Ooo, I got so much swag

That the people at the airport don't even wanna touch my bag

Only nigga in first class



[Break:]

Fall asleep

Fall asleep

Fall asleep

And I roll that weed and get baked off

Before the plane even take off, nigga I

Fall asleep

Catch me on the road gettin' money

I'm in a whole different country by the time I

Fall asleep

Fall asleep



[Verse 3:]

I'm flyer than most of 'em

They try and hate, but most love 'em

Them dollars, got most of 'em

Thanks to who supplyin' what I'm rollin' up

All this kush in my mind got me slowin' up

Don't gotta smoke, I get high enough for both of us

Get a O and blow and get another O and blow another O

Drew on the boards

Uhhhh haaahaaahahaaha

And I'm just doing

What I usually do man

Sticking to the script

No new lines



[Verse 1:]

I spend a lot of nights thinking

How did I make it this far

I spend money every chance I get

Cause God damn I work hard

Play here to take care of the family

But how was I supposed to know

If I don't take care of myself huhh

Then how am I supposed to grow

Still rollin my 0s, and all of my fans, they all at my shows

They rollin them pins and counting up all of them grams

We smoking 'til all of it's gone

Just bought a new crib and there's not enough space to fit all of my clothes



[Hook:]

I'm just riding out in my ride

Smoking weed while I drive

Flying like we were time

Smoking weed while I drive



[Verse 2:]

I spend a lot of days thinking

I hope this never gets old

Then I realize I'm on vacation

Somewhere it never gets cold

Some criticize decisions that I made

But fuck was I supposed to do

Long as I'm on everything is straight

Plus all my niggas on too

So you can't tell us nothing

Not a thing no discussion

You can smell what I'm smoking

Know its dank that I'm puffin

Kinda high when I made this

On the plane hella comfy

On my way to the money

That that'd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job
But instead they hating on what I've been doing

Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em

What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em

Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning

If the flight is private, we probably should board it

You see it you like it, I can probably afford it

If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing

You picked a crazy time to start letting me know

Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches

Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show

Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow

And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go

Started small but now we all in them bigger game

All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid

You talk shit, I won't respond back

What they gon' get, and you don't want that

That nigga will forget the deal

Remember what? get for real

My whip appeal, my crib is real

My wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille

And my grunge nigga, I make her come quicker

Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga

Top that, just some banging
Made enough of this money to quit complaining
But still I ain't made enough of it to quit the gaming

Hit the camin, cop the telly that's where the bitches hanging

Nice room I'm bugging wait 'til you hear the prize

Top floor she overcoming her fear of heights

Cut the wave she got motion sickness

Promise a paradise, and watch her settle for a pair of nikes

Poppin' that killa can't get enough of this skrilla

The papers the pina colada, the dutchess vanilla

They don't come any reala' I can handle the bell

Play the hand I was dealt, won't bluff any dealer

Hoes on my parlay fuck 'em the fair way

They wanna get to know me,my name is more then I care to tell

I'm just tellin' the truth, raising hell in the booth

Gotta make it to heaven,come back and skip through the sabbath

Make it back tomorrow don't care how much I spend

Think I'm a G wait 'til you meet my friends

A beast I've been now they wait on line

'Til I sign their CD for them I am

All who question sleep on him

Eating good soup don't leave a piece for them

We gon' smoke palm trees ,drink some gin

Couldn't walk in my shoes, know what your feet fit in

Since I been off the leach like I had a couple of drinks

Watch my buzz increase , now we twistin' up sipping champainge

On a beach, what either gets in a game go deceased nigga,nigga

Right about now

Not 'cause it's clear as day , because me and my niggers be clean

We stay fly haters hate when we step on the scene

'Cause we young black and living the american dream

Ok ,ok this is what I do planning six off in this thing

So it's what believe it's true

To what's about to happen homie I'm just waiting on my queue

The gun don't get 'em, pray that they don't let 'em

I looked in the mirror today

And seen the realest nigga I ever met in my life

Hahahaha, uhh...



I done smoked weed where they said I can't, got rich when they said I can't

Got high and got on the plane and brought all my niggas when they said I can't

Went shopping places they said I can't, bought some shit that they said I can't

Jumped on the road and did all them shows cause I was poppin' places they said I ain't

Went hard in places they said I can't, promoters call and try and set up dates

Bought the car with that yellow paint, go to parties now and they set up drinks

And it's first class so I'm private plane, Nudie jeans with my get up mane!

Rolling Papers and Mary J; I made eleven mill and I'm still the same



[Hook: Wiz Khalifa] (Juicy J)

What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man? All of this and I'm still the man

Thought of this when I was just a fan, but all this money wasn't in the plan

Now it's all about them Benjamins, ballin' hard and you in the stands

All this money I'm a business man; out of all these niggas I'm the realest man

(What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man? All of this and I'm still the man)

[Wiz Khalifa]

Out of all these niggas, they callin' me the realest

Started underneath the floor, now my money through the ceiling

Always staying on my grind, turned nothing to a million

Used to just tryna live, now a nigga make a killin'

Gold rollie on my arm, ten rings like a don

Cuban links in my chain, Zigzag on my charm

Champagne on ice, good weed in the jar

Everything Hermes, Chanel seats in the car

When you all know; them fuck niggas start hatin'

Talkin' bout what they gon' do but I'm waitin'

When you getting rich they doubt you; shout out my gang

And my brother Will cause I couldn't do this without you - fo' real!

[Juicy J]

Eighteen racks, I pay the dough to send them goons straight to ya door

To show you niggas what's real and let you meet that .44

Run your mouth you in the trunk, Glock to your head nowhere to run

Catch you niggas when you by yourself, we gon' hit you niggas with a hundred drums

Boat load no babbage, good drink I'm famished

Bank account outlandish, big real estate sittin' on land bitch

Niggas out there tryna test me, I put the AK where his chest be

Don't fight with hoes, don't fight with niggas, no security bitch so don't test me

Double cup full I be sippin' up, mob niggas man real criminals

If a nigga find you they gon' hit ya up, with a Bin Laden chopper that'll split ya up

All these hoes be jockin' tryna get with us, they gon' swallow this nut, no spittin up

Everything that I got I done came for

All the sh*t that you see I done slaved for

All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for

Need I say more

Spend so much money on clothes

Said f*ck a store, making my own

I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along

Can't say a thing, that's how you supposed to feel

Stacking all of this paper, dawg

Yeaah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]

Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer

Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture

I was with some wild niggas put me on the game

Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie

All you got your name and your words will never break

For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it

Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from

Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun

I was riding in my Bona Ville hoping I could make it

Out selling peas and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street

Way back in the day before I had all of this paper

Before I had all of these diamonds , before I had all of these haters



[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]

Now I remember when , I seen it and to me it was stuntin'

I remember when , I bought it I ain't needed or nothing

Always in a different state so now they label me a goner

I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner

Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there

Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there

And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it

Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate



[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

Now let's get medicated

Man , let's get medicated

Take your bitch home and poke it

Thank God I got a chauffeur

Only good cali bud

Pulling hoes bad as fuck

Just like a youngling my nigga

Juicy do all them drungs

Niggas smoking that beverage weed

I be on that light green

Pop marley in the after hours

A member of no slit team

Get a whole pound smoke it by myself

Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps



[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]

You know I'm fresh up out that corner, pussy marijuana

They copy us, they clone us

Yeah we so fly we on us

Got acting like they been before

But they ain't never been at all

8 balls I was in no hole

Ain't have time to fuck with y'all

Champagne when we celebrate

Keen sense so I smell the hate

Middle finger we getting paid

It cost much but don't press that eight

That dotted line it ain't like that day

Comic book let em ill it straight

Like power bang when they lift that cane

My cousin died wish I can get that day

Back like it's a vertebre

Bring that nigga on front street

Talk about and never be about it

They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch me

So anything you need you know that's on me

And that's OG, I swear homie

Man I'm hella faded

I'm hella faded



[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]

Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique

My city holding on to me so niggers holding on their heat

Throwing up their side rolling up that leaf

Ondoers get high all we want is peace

Always on the grind that's every day so police looking

I'm just rapping killing beats tryin' to stay away from booking

Yeah my nigga dirty crocked I just had to make it on

And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home



[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]

Now I remember when , I seen it and to me it was stuntin'

I remember when , I bought it I ain't needed or nothing

Always in a different state so now they label me a goner

I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner

Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there

Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there

And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it

Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate



[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

Now let's get medicated

Man , let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Man I'm hella faded

Man , let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Man I'm hella faded

I'm hella faded"

Yea
Worried bout a hater? Not me

Everything about me (bout me)

Everything about me, everything about me (bout me)

Everything about me (bout me)

Everything about me (what?)



Rolling, pockets swollen

Riding in it like it's stolen

Weeded, hella conceded

If it ain't about money, nigga I don't need it

Got a hundred grand in my ashtray

Spend a hundred K on a bad day

And I'm tied up like a cholo

Nigga act crazy, my dogs go loco

Kush got me moving slow mo

What my nigga Poblem? That's my bro bro

Came in through the backdoor

Ten mill this year on the low low

And I'm still smoking free rolls

Krissed out, dumb fucking with the cliko

And my bank full of zeros

Young Wiz will get fly like a hero



Worried bout a hater? Not me

Guess when you pulling money out, baby loving it

Goin crazy on a bitch until she knock me

I'm in that hella fast whip goin top speed

Make a mess in that pussy and then she mop clean

I drop racks and she drop G's

Smoke green as I lean, top droppin

Nigga I am all about a buck, falling out a truck

Probly with some hoes that I just met and yea they all gon fuck

Got a man calling up the homies, blowing all the mug

Tryna figure outwhich girl is, she probably toasted

Uh, like a champagne glass

So much money, there ain't a damn thing sap

Do my damn thing in my campaign add

Stuntin’ like a young nigga supposed to

Stuntin' like I’m supposed to



Ridin’ with my hat cocked back

Smokin’ something good 3 blunts and I’m smacked out

All city on smash, game on padlock

I'm back, and those who didn't previously know what i'm crack
To the people, i'm legalized the lethal

We all got problems involving the root of evil

But they caught me non-dodging, long arming the people, yup!

And for the record, I ain't no half stepper

I rose from the city of steel, the streets greedy for real

Cats chasing their paper, thats basic

Mathematics, hate to run the streets but took a staff at it

As I look back at hard it seems

I remember when this music thing was all but a dream

Get that money up and make your style a lil harder to follow

I've been hustlin' all the time, that's the only thing I know

Now my watch is worth 30 thousand, got Cuban links and Italian

Boy I'm gettin' it

Ridin' in my ride lookin' filthy rich

Killin' these niggas I ain't innocent, my bad

Ain't paid the cost, see they just watch me then copy my swag

Say I fell off that's where you lost me

How's that when my name is in my upholstery

I'm rollin' up and goin' places across seas

Hopin' the neighbor don't smell the shit I bake

And every day I'm on another plane

I hardly sleep, but hey I wouldn't have it any other way



Now here we are, now there we go

You rollin' on to where we smoke it all today

Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go

Like Tony with big blue bags of this shit

And tell 'em, ""Count it up""

Ridin' round in that Cali got OG kush in my body

My nigga I keep it G and that's Gucci or that Giani

I'm gettin' dressed for the airport to pose for the paparazzi

Talkin' big money, bitch, uh
That little shit you talkin' 'bout
That's lunch money

We don't even smoke that

And this shit gon' be like this for uh

Pretty much the rest of the time we here

My little niggas got more money than you fuck niggas man

I promise



[Hook:]

I got-I got-I got-I got so much

So much, so much, so much



[Verse 1:]

Quarter million, little nigga, I was nineteen

Had my hustle down pat, I did the right thing

They don't move that fast, they act like they don't like cheese

Had a couple niggas mad like they don't like me

Is it cause I'm hella paid? I think it might be

Yeah my pockets hella straight

And I smoke so much dope I got OG in my IV

So many niggas jackin' that shit don't even surprise me

I don't even want it back, shit it's off to the good

Can't even say I didn't know you would

Make a little money, get it from the bro

Bring that shit back to the hood

Anytime you see me, man I'm on the grind

Nigga wasn't workin' when you knew you should

Now you talk about me when I'm on the road

And when I ride by I'm in the newest one



[Hook:]

I got so much money I think I should pay for all this

They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'

I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'

Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin' [x2]

I got so much



[Verse 2:]

Big money

Even larger crib

No I ain't just stuntin'

That's how I'm supposed to live

I move fast paced

So I drive faster cars

Take a look outside

Those are really ours

And we're really stars

We all travel safe and go really far

In that custom paint, in that suede floor

In that California, that's really hard

In that California, that's what we on

Smell that strong, you know I'm baked

Chances dog, that's what we take

How much you hate, that's what we make

Roll up one, that's what we face

Lot of y'all claim that you real, gon' show up fake

But that shit don't mean a thing

Cause I'll still be on my grind

And stackin' all of this change



[Hook]



[Break:]

Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause

I got so much

Gin in my cup, twenty-two cones I'mma stuff

Lightin' another one up

(I got-I got-I got-I got so much)

Live it up, every dollar spend it up

Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause

(I got so much)

Gin in my cup, twenty two cones I'mma stuff

Lightin' another one up, cause



[Hook]



[Outro:]

Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys

Step up your game or step down

Whenever a problem troubles us all

If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow

For there's nothing too much for the great God to do

And all that he asks and expects of you

Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield

Confidence and knowledge that God knows best

And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test

But without God testin' of our soul

It never could reach the ultimate goal

So keep on knowing and believing

All that God has promised you would be yours to receive

Preach, Church, tabernacle

Wiz! Wiz! That's the way

Wiz! Wiz! That's the way

Wiz! Wiz! That's the way"

[Verse 1: Wiz]
Baby I go, hard
So hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on my job
Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone

Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all

Cause we done made it, too far

Got something to say then fuck 'em

Ain't trying to lose out on all of this for nothing

I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'mma get

No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent

And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich

And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit

That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since

Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips...wit'



[Hook x2: Courtney]

Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it

Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me

Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it



[Verse 2: Wiz]

And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring

Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me

Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you

Take you places where they using different language to greet you

Smile and shake when they meet you

Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get enough of me

Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me

Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me

Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want

And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me

Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'mma need it in a rush



[Hook x2]



[Bridge: Courtney]

Baby I can't break you heart, make you wait no more

Anytime you need me, I'll be right there for sure

You don't even have to call me, just say my name

I'll be right there waiting for you

I woke up in Hawaii today

For real, I hold dope

Uh, cause between all of these closets and all of these boxes I got

Ooo, I got so much swag

Only nigga in first class

I'm flyer than most of 'em

What I usually do man

Sticking to the script

No new lines



[Verse 1:]

I spend a lot of nights thinking

How did I make it this far

I spend money every chance I get

Cause God damn I work hard

Play here to take care of the family

But how was I supposed to know

If I don't take care of myself huhh

Then how am I supposed to grow

Still rollin my 0s, and all of my fans, they all at my shows

They rollin them pins and counting up all of them grams

We smoking 'til all of it's gone

Just bought a new crib and there's not enough space to fit all of my clothes

I'm just riding out in my ride

Smoking weed while I drive

Flying like we were time

Smoking weed while I drive

I spend a lot of days thinking

I hope this never gets old

Then I realize I'm on vacation

Somewhere it never gets cold

Some criticize decisions that I made

But fuck was I supposed to do

Long as I'm on everything is straight

Plus all my niggas on too

So you can't tell us nothing

Not a thing no discussion

You can smell what I'm smoking

Know its dank that I'm puffin

Kinda high when I made this

On the plane hella comfy

On my way to the money

Uh, you would have thought that from seeing me going hard
That that'd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job
But instead they hating on what I've been doing

Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em

What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em

Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning

If the flight is private, we probably should board it

You see it you like it, I can probably afford it

If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing

You picked a crazy time to start letting me know

Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches

Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show

Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow

And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go

Started small but now we all in them bigger game

All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid

Then the paper came

Then the haters came

But we still rise above [x2]

My phone is dead, but I got a contact

My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats

You talk shit, I won't respond back

What they gon' get, and you don't want that

That nigga will forget the deal

Remember what? get for real

My whip appeal, my crib is real

My wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille

And my grunge nigga, I make her come quicker

Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga

I Tebow, for hoes that eat hoes

Emojis fo' me and my people

Top that, just some banging
Made enough of this money to quit complaining
But still I ain't made enough of it to quit the gaming

Hit the camin, cop the telly that's where the bitches hanging

Nice room I'm bugging wait 'til you hear the prize

Top floor she overcoming her fear of heights

Cut the wave she got motion sickness

Promise a paradise, and watch her settle for a pair of nikes

Poppin' that killa can't get enough of this skrilla

The papers the pina colada, the dutchess vanilla

They don't come any reala' I can handle the bell

Play the hand I was dealt, won't bluff any dealer

Hoes on my parlay fuck 'em the fair way

They wanna get to know me,my name is more then I care to tell

I'm just tellin' the truth, raising hell in the booth

Gotta make it to heaven,come back and skip through the sabbath

Make it back tomorrow don't care how much I spend

'Til I sign their CD for them I am

Eating good soup don't leave a piece for them

We gon' smoke palm trees ,drink some gin

Couldn't walk in my shoes, know what your feet fit in

Since I been off the leach like I had a couple of drinks

Watch my buzz increase , now we twistin' up sipping champainge

On a beach, what either gets in a game go deceased nigga,nigga

Right about now

Not 'cause it's clear as day , because me and my niggers be clean

We stay fly haters hate when we step on the scene

'Cause we young black and living the american dream

Ok ,ok this is what I do planning six off in this thing

So it's what believe it's true

To what's about to happen homie I'm just waiting on my queue

Must be some real shit though
Let's get it, here we go...

I looked in the mirror today

And seen the realest nigga I ever met in my life

Hahahaha, uhh...



I done smoked weed where they said I can't, got rich when they said I can't

Got high and got on the plane and brought all my niggas when they said I can't

Went shopping places they said I can't, bought some shit that they said I can't

Jumped on the road and did all them shows cause I was poppin' places they said I ain't

Went hard in places they said I can't, promoters call and try and set up dates

Bought the car with that yellow paint, go to parties now and they set up drinks

And it's first class so I'm private plane, Nudie jeans with my get up mane!

Rolling Papers and Mary J; I made eleven mill and I'm still the same



[Hook: Wiz Khalifa] (Juicy J)

What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man? All of this and I'm still the man

Thought of this when I was just a fan, but all this money wasn't in the plan

Now it's all about them Benjamins, ballin' hard and you in the stands

All this money I'm a business man; out of all these niggas I'm the realest man

(What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man? All of this and I'm still the man)

(Thought of this when I was just a fan, but all this money wasn't in the plan)

[Wiz Khalifa]

Out of all these niggas, they callin' me the realest

Started underneath the floor, now my money through the ceiling

Always staying on my grind, turned nothing to a million

Used to just tryna live, now a nigga make a killin'

Gold rollie on my arm, ten rings like a don

Cuban links in my chain, Zigzag on my charm

Champagne on ice, good weed in the jar

Everything Hermes, Chanel seats in the car

When you all know; them fuck niggas start hatin'

Talkin' bout what they gon' do but I'm waitin'

When you getting rich they doubt you; shout out my gang

And my brother Will cause I couldn't do this without you - fo' real!

Eighteen racks, I pay the dough to send them goons straight to ya door

To show you niggas what's real and let you meet that .44

Run your mouth you in the trunk, Glock to your head nowhere to run

Catch you niggas when you by yourself, we gon' hit you niggas with a hundred drums

Boat load no babbage, good drink I'm famished

Bank account outlandish, big real estate sittin' on land bitch

Niggas out there tryna test me, I put the AK where his chest be

Don't fight with hoes, don't fight with niggas, no security bitch so don't test me

Double cup full I be sippin' up, mob niggas man real criminals

If a nigga find you they gon' hit ya up, with a Bin Laden chopper that'll split ya up

All these hoes be jockin' tryna get with us, they gon' swallow this nut, no spittin up

That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd

N*gga listen

Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen

And not a thing goes down without permission

Look, everything I got on I was made for

Everything that I got I done came for

All the sh*t that you see I done slaved for

All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for

Need I say more

Spend so much money on clothes

Said f*ck a store, making my own

I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along

And know I was rolling one while I was making this song

Pour out some shots

You're taking too long

We lose control

Drop the top in that '69

And that motor roar in that old Chevelle

Can't say a thing, that's how you supposed to feel

Stacking all of this paper, dawg

I like to call this sh*t old news

It means haters jocking our old moves

Popping champagne cause we made it

All of this sh*t that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]

Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer

Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture

I was with some wild niggas put me on the game

Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie

All you got your name and your words will never break

For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it

Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from

Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun

I was riding in my Bona Ville hoping I could make it

Out selling peas and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street

Way back in the day before I had all of this paper

Before I had all of these diamonds , before I had all of these haters



[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]

Now I remember when , I seen it and to me it was stuntin'

I remember when , I bought it I ain't needed or nothing

Always in a different state so now they label me a goner

I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner

Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there

Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there

And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it

Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate



[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

Now let's get medicated

Man , let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Man I'm hella faded

Man , let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Man I'm hella faded

I'm hella faded



[Verse 2: Juicy J]

Rolling weed up and smoke it

Take your bitch home and poke it

Juicy begin so faded

Thank God I got a chauffeur

Only good cali bud

Pulling hoes bad as fuck

Just like a youngling my nigga

Juicy do all them drungs

Niggas smoking that beverage weed

I be on that light green

Pop marley in the after hours

A member of no slit team

Get a whole pound smoke it by myself

Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps



[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]

You know I'm fresh up out that corner, pussy marijuana

They copy us, they clone us

Yeah we so fly we on us

Got acting like they been before

But they ain't never been at all

8 balls I was in no hole

Ain't have time to fuck with y'all

Champagne when we celebrate

Keen sense so I smell the hate

Middle finger we getting paid

It cost much but don't press that eight

That dotted line it ain't like that day

Comic book let em ill it straight

Like power bang when they lift that cane

My cousin died wish I can get that day

Back like it's a vertebre

Bring that nigga on front street

Talk about and never be about it

They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch me

So anything you need you know that's on me

And that's OG, I swear homie



[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

Now let's get medicated

Man , let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Man I'm hella faded

Man , let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Man I'm hella faded

I'm hella faded



[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]

Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique

My city holding on to me so niggers holding on their heat

Throwing up their side rolling up that leaf

Ondoers get high all we want is peace

Always on the grind that's every day so police looking

I'm just rapping killing beats tryin' to stay away from booking

Yeah my nigga dirty crocked I just had to make it on

And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home



[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]

Now I remember when , I seen it and to me it was stuntin'

I remember when , I bought it I ain't needed or nothing

Always in a different state so now they label me a goner

I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner

Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there

Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there

And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it

Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate



[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

Now let's get medicated

Man , let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Man I'm hella faded

Man , let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

Let's get medicated

That's more rolls at the courtyard

Take it to the Marriott

Watch a nigga paint, Basquiat

Got my own water, so I bought a yacht)

Y'all niggas complacent

From walk town to that basement

To the top floor that's so spacious

At the Westin, just restin'



Me, J.R., and Wiz go back like rentals

Gettin' money watchin' for the wenchels

Chains got to write like pencils

Got magazines for them issues

We on one, you damn right

Pants small but them bands right

She ain't gay but she playin' dyke

I'm no plumb' but I'm layin' pipe

Like what



Nigga bout to take this shot

Nigga really gettin' this bread

Niggas say they ballin' but they not

Smokin weed, livin' in the air

Fuck it man I threw it all

That shit be good I would pass her the sack, bitch I'm like Santa Claus

Flippin' money and smokin' weight

Make a mess I'm holdin' cake

Nigga I take yo bitch nigga

That's the reason why you love to hate

I buy Louis just to meditate

Kush bags just to medicate

I'm just tryna levitate

Hit the mall and blow a whip

Hundred k I double dip

Turn around and double it

Nigga I supply the hood

Got plastics filled with benjamins

Juicy J I'm gettin' that purp, work

Pockets never hurt

If I fall off (nope), the trap where I revert

Rolling up airplanes, 'bout to catch an airplane

Riding in my old-school, listening to old school

Doing it how a G's supposed to do

It's getting cold, I might close the roof

Made it up to first class, staying in first class

Remember I ain't at first class, now I'm the only nigga in first class

Started with a bus pass, then I copped a old-school

Now I got so many cars, I ain't got enough room

Twenty mill and got more to go

Roll some weed and then roll some mo'

If you don't, you're nameless

84, that's 3 in the pot, these niggas jealous, I'm something they're not

It's all good, shit, I expected that

Shit I been sleep since we lifted off where we left at

Yeah it's cool to you, but it's What we deserve

Needle on the track, I'm dope, you niggas got some nerve

That's drug talk, '88 Volvo, gold BB's, man rest in peace, Macho

Shit, where I'm from, even kids know the call

Hit it with some ice, just to cool it off

I was workin; up on that corner like I had a job

Up in the corner servin', I ain't have a prob

I'm still feel like I'm sleeping

With all of this happenin', am I dreamin'?

But, shit, I'm high and I'm wide awake

And I what I want I can afford, ain't that a escape

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]

Talkin' raw papers and long leathers

Nigga, my drawer filled with couture textures

Killin' these niggas, bring more stretchers

Amazed by how I'm in that new Mason Martin Margiela

With my team, we at the car dealer

Smokin' big green, I'm talkin' Godzilla

You're talkin' money, then you sound familiar

The suite wasn't big enough so me, I bought the villa

The whip was sick enough, I went and got the I'll one

Your tree wasn't enough, good thing I brought some killa

Bitch I'm a king, and all my team is loyal niggas

My wife's a queen with diamond rings and full chinchillas

And I was raised with niggas with get-money inentions

Lot of young niggas gettin' made, but I'm the realest

Give a fuck about if a nigga hatin'

My dollar accumulation my only motivation

When it's time to ball, niggas better think of you

You see the life you wanna live on TV and wanna be a part of it

Spend every night just popping bottles, pouring drinks in VIP, and you love it

The more you make, the more they hate, the more they're fake, don't worry, that's just how the game go

Wouldn't have shit if it wasn't for it

Smokin' on medicinal, spraying ozium to try cover it

In the game playin' hard, but I'm just in the game, I ain't in love with it

Y'all niggas tryin' to get famous, a nigga like me tryin' to get fuckin' rich

Fuckin' rich, fuckin' rich, broke ass niggas can't fuck with this

Fuck a deal, when it goes down, got a hundred mill on my fuckin' list

That shit you niggas trying to do

I guarantee I did it twice

They say life's a gamble, hit my joint and roll the dice

When you living this high, you can't be afraid of heights

Book my flight to vegas well, 20 tho to stay the night

Another 10 on champagne, my money long I pay the price

Tired of niggas saying they in my game cause dawg we ain't alike

I'm throwing money, when I walk up in this bitch, they know it's money

Money in my arms, another tables full of money

Pockets full of joints I rolled

Dropping ashes on my clothes (clothes)

Balling super hard, smoking till I over dose

Hardly ever sober bitch, we party till it's over

Get your money up and quit your hating's what you oughta do

I been going hard since I was younger

When I was in my teens I knew when I got older I'll be on some now I do my things

Spending money, popping hella bottles, making niggas mad

Going places, rolling J's, I live the life you wish you had

Throwing up dollar bills, Dolce on my tags

Got a joint full of that OG

Got a clip full of them OG's

Trippy nigga hit the club, you know I be fucked up

Chasing after the model chicks, trying to get my fucks up

Niggas handcuffing hoes, but them niggas know what's up

Y'all came to the club together, but that hoe gonna leave with us

Break at the blue dream, everybody rolling up

Hold the lean, hold the cups, hold it down then pour it up

Tell the owner we ain't leaving, we gonna buy the whole club

And my autograph is bigger to your nieces and your nephews

Made man, ain't nobody make a nigga

'Bout to book a flight to Vegas, tryna take one with us

You niggas too small dawg, I'm thinking bigger

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]

It's your anniversy is'nt it

And your man ain't acting right

So you packin' your Domiar luggage up callin' my cell phone, try and catch a flight

You know one thing straight, I'll be there girl whenever you call me

When you at home that's your man, soon as you land you say that's all me

But shit ain't all g with him no more, you ain't entertained

Since I meet you a couple months ago you ain't been the same

Not sayin I'm the richest man alive but I'm in the game

As long as you keep it 100 I'm a spend this change,



[Chorus:]

Whenever you need me

Whenever want me,

You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly

Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me

I can be your best friend, and you be my homie

I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front

You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt

Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up

Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up

Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up

Whenever you call baby I roll up



[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]

I try to stay out your business

But on the real you're so obvious

And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin up, your mans gonna catch onto us

That white sand surrouding us

He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers

If you rolling I got a spot where I can put you on this medical, and send you home doctored up

You wanna ride with me cause you say that he boring

Wake up you rollin' weed, cooking eggs in the morning

Ain't scared to spend this money I'll make more of it

First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit



[Chorus]



No matter where I am

No matter where you are

I'll be there when it's over baby

Cause I was there from the start

No matter if I'm near

Don't matter if your far

All you do is pick the phone up lady

And I'll be there when you call



[Outro:]

Whenever you need me

Whenever want me,

You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly

Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me

You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt

Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up

Wake up, wake up, 
I don't wanna wake up, wake up.
Wake up, wake up, 
I don't wanna wake up, wake up.



[Chorus:]

Yeah i'm straight never switch lanes, 

on my job everyday 'cause it's hard not to see

I came up in a big way 

and I hardly ever sleep but it's like a dream

I don't wanna wake up from, 

don't wanna wake up

I don't wanna wake up from, 

I don't wanna wake up from

don't wanna wake up from



Ohh, long days, but I know hard work pays

so the money getting long to

And the cush smell strong too,

That's that good any chick with me she da bomb too

One thing I know is go hard young 

make fake niggas know this

Blowing money 'cause you're dyin' if you don't live

That's how you know that I was fly when I wrote this

First class tags or maybe I'm in first 

'cause of my first class swag

Used to say that I was trippin, 

so a nigga bought expensive ass bags



[Chorus]



Go hard young, go hard

They let you in the game, better play your part

Go hard young, go hard 

and if you win the game as well play smart

'Cause I've seen niggas fold like paper, 

got money seen friends turn haters

Got money minor league turn major, 

got money white people turn neighbors

Meet a girl teach her how to roll papers, 

six months three whips so player

run my town like the mayor

run my town bitch like the major



[Chorus]



I can take you up higher than you ever know

Let you touch what you want

hit it once and you won't let go, hell no

let you lean back, inhale smoke (inhale smoke)

The World turning, the weed burning
Them haters talking, I keep earning
Know some will say that lifes a bitch
Well I'm a flirtin and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is

Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants

Keep verses, Mortal Kombat

Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' then what you call that

Nothing but neck and back cause I never left

I did everything right nigga better yet

Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us

Something like a contractor building from the ground up

Now just

Twist up this weed

Realise that you are in the presence of a G

Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese

Or the ones I use to roll up my trees

Fuck it, you know what I mean



[Chorus:]

I'm riding round, smoking, good music aloud

Kinda do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me

Some smile up in your face but then they don't on the low

Now I just stunt on my own

Now I just stunt on my own



I'm in a race, and taking the winners place

No foot on the brakes

One the best, homie that's what they call me

It's lonely at the top, got no company so

Now I just stunt on my own

Now I just stunt on my own



[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]

See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me

My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me

But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty

Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's

Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's

My dime piece only recognise the best tree's

Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe

You in her face, I let her breath



From debated on, to waited on

From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on

Cause we are, Young Movie stars

Cause we are, Young Movie stars



[Chorus]



(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)

(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)

(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)



[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]

O-ooo-oh, now I just stunt on my own

Bitches ain't say shit to me but now they won't leave me alone

Used to walk the other way

But now they all come to my home

And they calling my phone, cause my paper was looong

Nothing, they ain't singing my song

Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along

We flying up, now you want me to take it all off

Want me to take it all off



Tell a bitch I'm a ball and I'm a buy a new crib for my niggas n all

Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all

Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall

Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star

Cause we are, young, gifted, not to mention out here making motherfucking millions

Yeah, I said it, motherfucking millions

Got my money up, I'm in the building

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]

See I've been going on and on for ever

Them haters probably wonder when I'm gone stop, never!

Most of it's been good but I've seen some bad weather

And niggas watching now, wouldn't even give me an umbrella

But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own

May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along

When I was 16, finna get put out my home

Now the man making money, my nigga, my money growing

And I can do what I what, went form being hated on

To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on

Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown

So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone

I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong

Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song

Party every weekend, hardly ever home

Don't see me face to face so you have to tlak about me when I gone



[Chorus:]

Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)

Niggas who can't support their own

So keep pay me from the crowd

Everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-owww

The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)

The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)

The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)

The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)



[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]

The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up

And all my jewelery ice to piece froze up

I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up

Have any nigga in the World but she chose us

I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us

Get you to buy us a drink than it's over cause

We back around the time that she sober'd up

Shit ain't been the same since the limosuine showed up

The best moments of my life

Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life

Rarely gon to see, smoking with ya wife

Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice

It's the way we know, wake up in the morn'

Like ""where did all my paper go""

Grow some more weed and get medicated

Everyday is a holiday so we celebrated

Waking up in the morning, two hoes laying next to me

Good weed and cold drinks, that's the motherfucking recipe

It's going down in this bitch, concrete

We gon' party all night, no sleep

Tell the owner them is all my guys

So tonight everything is on me

Leaving from the club now she wanna stay with us

Came to spend it all, don't care what I'm paying for

Used to be too young, now I'm out here buying the bar

Every time I look up, it's another red cup

Bunch of niggas in the game but they ain't playing with us

They just paying enough

Man them niggas ain't ballin' they just laying it up

Saying they does, I'm just rolling hella weed up

While on my way to the club

I had to wait at the club

But now I don't cause everything is on me

I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl
Every night you keep calling me with the same shit

I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way

It's gonna kill me to say this but you gotta



Pack your stuff leave my keys

Get your shit gotta go

Pack your stuff leave my keys

Get your shit gotta go

Pack your stuff leave my keys

Get your shit gotta go

I told you that I'm moving on

You didn't well it's hard to know



[?] I admit it was my mission

But everything went wrong there

'Cause you started acting different

The day you ran up on me I was smoking

Chillin' swore you was trying to roll, ain't know it was so appealin'

Fast forward I'm on the road

You at home calling me back forth

Can't do with this relationship

But this what you asked for

Asked for them pictures of them bitches shit

I probably wouldn't be with 'em

If your shit ass wasn't trippin'

Not to mention you're acting like a kid

It's the fuck shit I gotta deal with

Send a text leave me a message try not to listen

Bring the ref' you was the main player I had to bench you

When I showed your ass how to ball

That Louie I bought it all

Gone on the road, and I'm hardly home on the weekend

You'll be blowing my phone up tryin to see who I'm seeing

But I'm chasing this paper so for this paper I'm reaching

Might fuck one or two bitches but don't consider it cheatin'

I considered the fact I will break up anyway, anyway

Based on all that shit you don't appreciate

Me switching states, working hard meetin and dates,

You were thinking everything was sweet piece of cake

Well that all change, what we have is big

But you're gonna miss the small things

And that little cash I spent that was small change

But above all things I still love you

Just gotta do my own thing

Go, I'll never come back

Now when you call I'll never call back

Where we goin' next week I let my hoes choose
No socks in my boat shoes
Guess a nigga eatin' good like Whole Foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ridin' with me, so she pose too

See me and my guys like a plane flown through

Hella high, roll the weed up like I'm supposed to

And now I'm into big things

Own the building, you need to know the tenant rate

Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt

Let a bitch give me brain call it homework

Niggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work



A lotta shit done changed

New clothes, new car, new thangs

The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up

That’s what they say

Used to not be allowed in the building

But now we on the rooftop

Used to not be allowed in the building

But now we on the rooftop



Slow money just as bad as gettin' no money

But learn to get good show money, that's your money

Get comfortable with it, really know money

Rich nigga shit, that really goes for me

Self made nigga, well played

I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade

You tryna copy what's been done, I'm tryna innovate

And club owners gettin' tired of tryna ventilate, big mistake

I'm too busy findin' places and trips to take

The more I smoke the more money my business make

Remember they used to be like who is this?

Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day

When you around the real, you keep it real everyday

My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say

Either you gettin' paid or you payin' to play

Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

Used to not be allowed in the building

But now we on the roof top



Just made a million, got another million on my schedule

The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless

You niggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did

They hatin' was the fuel for this shit

So you wrote your own check off a ho ass

Sweatin' bullets at home, wonderin' if she comin' back

Whodi you a simp and she can smell it on ya

That's why you only see her when you buyin' stuff for her

We was sneakin' in then it was general admission

Now we own the arena decidin' who allowed in it

My windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'

Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin'

We plotted this out, one night in the city

Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twistin'

Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it

TwitPicin' when we get it and they mad at us, fuck them niggas



A lotta shit done changed

New clothes, new car, new thangs

The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up

It's hardly a secret
You ain't gonna stop trying get where you going until you reach it
Always had them bars back in the day
When the same ones runnin' up on you wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements

You work hard so it would be kinda hard hard not to believe that

You party every weekend

Fuck 'em all who act like they ain't seen a thing

All them nights on the plane, losses of nigga it took, had to charge it to the game

Always wanted stardom and the fame

Learn to out smart 'em and now it,

Ain't no stopping this champagne from popping

The drawls from dropping, I'm seeing muscle cars and copin' 'em

Started off just a little less popular



[Chorus:]

Now you got a new place, you drive a new car

You smile for the cameras, and life like you're super star

Don't care what they say you reach for the stars

Got everything you always dreamed and thought about

And everyone knows who you are



Never gets boring, them haters in your face you just ignore them

Don't know what they talking shit for

See niggas get theirs you just trying to get yours

Therefore, you left all the people you cared for

Hopped on a plane, got airborne

Seen the bullshit coming and fell for it

But it's all good now 'cause the same ones who talk shit

Telling everyone you made it,

Then you start seeing whose you dated

And thoughts start getting jaded

Now your life is sorta different, ain't it

Do your scars know what your pain it

But was it all worth, if it's painless

Say you wanna be famous

Now you got a new place, you drive a new car

You smile for the cameras, and life like you're super star

Don't care what they say you reach for the stars

Got everything you always dreamed and thought about

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, who you are, oh



I always knew I was this good

But never knew I'd be this good

Them niggas just start I've been doing it

Hear 'em talk about but they ain't living my life

In the dark trying to get in my light

But chances I don't get them guys twice

Spending grands for hoes this is a highlight

And for them cameras posing this is the high life

Bottles raising for my niggas not here, I pour out a couple sips

Pour 'em out on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips

Them days I was younger I knew life was the shit but never like this

It's so amazing Will got it done, shots, we just pour and chase them

And worry about it cause they gonna hate, know where I'm going

Look where I came from



[Chorus:]

Now you got a new place, you drive a new car

You smile for the cameras, and life like you're super star

Don't care what they say you reach for the stars

Got everything you always dreamed and thought about

And everyone knows who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, who you are, oh"

Breaking down the weed I'm bout to make a plane

Lot of niggas fake but me I'm these hoes fate

Feed her alcohol and leave that bitch with no taste

Out of this world need my own space

Back seat and I'm a ride until the chrome break

Big heat will turn your body to a cold case

She don't even make it rain she just throw me face

Got some niggas quick to bang like they major pain

Told there mom I rep the gang she just say the same

I pull up in car service looking like the man

Hella reefer smoke a lot of pictures being taken

My bitch from Atlanta my weed is Jamaican

Bout a booty that's my conversation

Took her car keys and let her played the way

Motherfucker that's cause big money bought it to you

I'll be stuntin while them little niggas sayin' nothing

High ceilings, high hoes, high prices for my clothes and I don't even pay for it

Barely no major shit

Need a bitch, take a bitch, straight back to that big crib

Let you roll some rapper weed, put you on some new shit

Hit this weed, I show you how I do this

My excuse is I'm in Cali so my smoke's highly exclusive

And my bitch bad, my money's through the roof

Your money short you looking mad

You Danny Bonaduce bitch

I'm jumpin' in my coupe

I'm rollin' something that taste like fruit

And I hear them niggas talkin' shit but there's nothing much that they can do

When I got a bitch in your city, you should try when you see her

Never trippin' on no hoes, nigga what you thought we gettin' money over here



[Wiz Khalifa:]

I'm ballin' hard, my niggas in the same game

I do it big my niggas do the same thing

I'm throwin' signs, it's looking like I gang bang

I'm on the team, it's lookin like I gang bang

I'm rolling up, my niggas roll the same thing

I'm smokin' weed, my bitch smoke the same thing

I'm throwin signs it's looking like I gang bang



[Verse 2: Big Sean]

I tell a bitch bow down to a motherfucking G hoe

I work hard, I drink slow

But I never keep drinks low, smokey smokey cause I'm a cheapo

Sippin' on Pinot Grigio, really hoe, got everything like I got me a genie hoe, yeah

My car look like a building, diamonds dancing on top of my wrist

Bitch I'm ten feet tall when I'm standing on top of my dick

You a sucker hoe, sucka hoe

I'm success, I feel like a million dollars, bitch I'm up next

Money in my hand, I don't need no hand out

And they all got their hands up cause they fuck with me hands down

And the car I push got more tent than a camp round

And my picture always on your bitch background

Like Prada, it's just me and Cyhi

Young enough to be your son, but she call me big papa

She gave me her oh nana, now disappear like tada

She smoking on that Tada, now who the fuck gon stop her

Kicked the bitch out and make her find new friends

Should I get hella high or buy some new rims

Through all the bullshit overcame and still remain ah G

She leave the room you smell it on her fingers bro

Asking silly questions bout ""Where you been""?

Saying ""You look different""

Had the time of her life not to mention

You ain't been this high in ah minute

Took ownership of the air, I'm fly, you niggas just trynna visit



[Chorus:]

(Yeaaaaaaaa) (YAAAAAAAAAA BITCH!)

While you at home on twitter trynna hackin' her page and shyt

A tight end became from underground lik ah oiler

Waiter take ma order

Ya'll been waitin for real niggas to eat the way they ought to' (Heyy) (Kylly run it)



[Verse 3: Killa Kyleon]

G.O.O.D music is the consequnce, we legends (Really Tho)

Minus Kanye, buh we got this money in common

We get it day and night

Gutter marijuy don't want it

I'm the shit, no plumbin

Money talk, no hummin

Put the GPS on it

Located, I'm comingggg

I'm in something Paper-Plated

Get it, decapitate it

And if the bomb creams

Super boats swangs fascinated

With the fast life

Haters to the left I got my cash right

Irish spring green make 'em blow it like a bag pipe

Lit up like a flashlight

VVS's is in my necklace lookin like bad dikes

All my bitches bad like

Mike no homo, Amber Rose, Kim Kardash type

5 star chicks, first class like my last flight.



[Chorus:]

Where ever that paaaper go, I'm gon' get it, so mami are you with it?

I gotta knoowwww, we in da spotlight

[Verse 1]
You couldn't walk a mile in these 11 in a halfs even if you had a chance.
Visions of this cash followed with the thought of the bitch thats chilling at my pad.

Its all part of the plan.

To come through get high as I can, party, hit the studio jet lagged.

Packing my over night carry on, we dont check bags.

Old folks are proud to see I'm young and I Louied up to my eyes.

True story word to the wise dont let these labels gas you up to be somethin.

Get yo paper never trust em.

Watch the niggas you run with.

I done seen niggas who had all they dreams fucked over, over some dumb shit.

& make no assumptions hotel owners saying the odors to pungent blame it on the reefer consumption.

The difference between you guys is you lie & we live it.

In the sky so pay us a visit.

Bet yo bitch be trying to kick it.

What you aint you trying to eat nigga.

COME ON, fuck is you waiting for.

Nigga time just sitting around man. COME ON.

Everything was all good. Now shit real.



[Verse 2]

Soon as I enter the room its red carpets and bitches with pretty smelling perfume.

Smoking cigars shit was fool.

Now you roll hella doobs and anticipate that how fly tune.

Sucker shit we just cant excuse

Steady trying to duplicate but they aint us.

Got bitches dissing they lame ass niggas pot head kids rolling they dank up.

Paparazzi taking pictures we famous

Held my city down like a anchor.

Now its champagne we drink.

Non-smoking room we just ashen em in the sink.

I love her attitude she love tracing my ink.

I get up in the wind. Leave her with something to ease stress.

The best not just regular visions.

Let you get a glimpse of how I'm living, HD

Come on man leave that bullshit alone man.

I couldn't wait to go and cop from ray and them

and nigga them bills need pay but I'm...

That's digital situation critical

Hate to make it so blatant baby

Maybe you got me confused

With one of them other dudes.

I aint none of them.

Under they breath mumbling.

Scared to tell them hoes what it is.

You put yourself in that position.

I chill with all that baller fishing

You fucked around and you caught a shark.

Cold hard, tell your feelings too fall.

I'm too focused on getting my rims polo-coated.

One of the dopest, I'm scheduled one

You just ibuprofen, what is you smoking?

I'm focused to growing they got you choking

The options open, you can hide with them suckers

Or ride low and get higher than a motherfucka!

Straight stunting, sucker niggas I take from them.

They bitches that is, get up in the car with wiz

They know they going to bank something, aint fronten.

Smoking off the eighth onion

Get it twisted because you see me on your computer screen

Thinking because you got wireless you get as high as us

Bitches leaving they lame niggas to ride with us

Planes over everything in the fly we trust.

This bottle smell is obvious

Than my connect come from cali

Im good long as the money piling up

All the while im just quick lane pimping

Big jane twisting

Walking how I talk it bitch that's Pittsburgh pimping.

Yo I was candy coated, Bentley colored

?? really made it

Killing with the bumper grill

Chandelier ceiling kush ?

? is you fucking, is you sucking

I was wondering cuz if not

Don't be pushing all my buttons in my cutless

Unless you cutting. Bitch I'm just saying

I aint tricking is the reason that this porno flick playing

Troy shaking knocking pictures off the wall

Southern made call, 808 mean no draws

You got friends I fuck them all

What you mean you aint nasty

Why the fuck you came

Just imagine what you got to do to get up in my plane.

Mississippi (?) mouth piece frigid

Throw the mic out of sight

Show you bright can you feel it shawty

See there's no dinner or winner for second place huh?

Yea that what I figure so I handle my business.

Confidentiality, all my plans to get richer.

Then I, Master my role as my plan unfold.

Right moves, make sure the left hand don't know.

Words from a wiser predecessor: Never let up.

I know how to spot a fool cause he never shut up.

If you speak it, you don't know it. You know it, you don't speak it.

Can't feel me if you put your vertebrae on the speakers.

See it got to be, and your nine on ya.

I got higher than Chong on bongs in California.

Catch me in your in local cool spots cata corner?

Virgins to the herb frown at that aroma.

For those inquisitive, scoot closer to Phips a bit.

I invite you to get higher than what you've experienced.

Um, There's some who think they smoke, but We stay Higher.

And some think they get fly, but We get Flyer.

Some ashes in the sink, couple drinks we was pourin' in.

My niggas sleep, bitches rollin weed while I'm Yawnin'.

It's just a routine after a night of performin'.

I turn the hotel into a Polo Party.

Makin' them eggs with cheese, let 'em smoke so much weed.

Them hoes think we in the '70s.

Big Dog, better pedigree.

She in this king size bed with me.

Give her space boy, Let her breathe.

And I mean that technically,

Roll up the trees, like my weed grown medically.

Less of the seeds, Niggas still got the hatin' disease,

When actually they know.

Bite or bark, fight or heart

I'm a keep rollin' trees nigga, light or spark.

By the strength of the quality weed smell
You can tell that I'm somewhere in the building on my Batman shit
Niggas suspended from the ceiling

Not really, but that's the way the weed got me feeling

Got a low rise in Venice

Mami you got the vision and I see it HD

And it couldn't be any clearer

You should be with Spitta

And you know that this your chance, don't blow it like birthday candles

Good guy Spitta keep his name outta them scandals

It's not a secret, I prefer my girls in sneakers, never sandals

Posing naked in only a pair of Nike Vandals

Bottles pop, back to back

Extra large chronic sack

Cellphone, camera's out

Mama I remember that

Anytime I look at that

I go to wondering where you at

So baby where you at

With it

I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly

And maybe we get back up in a minute



[Chorus: x2]

Fast cars

Fly clothes

G5's flying on the seashores

Get it

Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly

So tell me if you is

Or if you isn't

With it

(Yeah)



[Wiz Khalifa:]

Listen, if you with it, get in

What you sipping

Hit it out of the park

That's if you pitching

First you look at me wrong

Like uh uh, no he didn't

Then you turn into rubbing on me

You start to give in, get it

By the beach, watching tennis

Crack another bottle of Perignon

Louis V carry-ons when you visit

Sending all them singles in your sidekick sentence

Then I reply like be there in a minute

Just put me and Curren$y on your friend list

The weed come from a village

Truck tire, sour diesel scented, that's real shit

From smelling this she wanna see how the cigar taste

We lighting reefer bumping 808's & heartbreaks

Skinny broad but out them jeans she got a heart shape

Skip the movie date and take her to the horse race

And let you bet it all keep the winnings

Young entrepreneur give you the business, dig it (Yeah)



[Chorus: x2]

Fast cars

Fly clothes

G5's flying on the seashores

Get it

Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly

So tell me if you is

Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'm a go hard
I'm a go hard or I'm a go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye



Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'm a go hard

I'm a go hard or I'm a go home

I haven't been there you know in so long

So goodbye



I worked for everything I own

Dare a nigga try and take it

Take 300 on the frames

Just from blocking out you haters



Swear they're in my way

They in my rear view mirror

If a nigga act stupid

I'm a let him get his issue



Everything designer

And my back seat's reclining

Got a thing for looking good

And blowing money like it's tissue



But niggaz see you eating

Get to starving for a plate

Well, you don't give it when they hate

That's why my niggas keep a biscuit



It's no gimmick

I talk it how I live it

So when a nigga cross the finish

Gotta push it to the limit



Got a mom and little sister

I plan on taking care of

Lost my uncle this year

Couple niggas in the system



So I roll

No telling where I'm landing

But I know something

That I'm going towards the money



I can see you niggas slacking

Everyday I'm on my job

Yung Khalifa going hard

Till the I'm last man standing



Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'm a go hard

Go hard or I'm a go home

I haven't been there you know in so long

So goodbye



Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'm a go hard

Go hard or I'm a go home

I haven't been there you know in so long

So goodbye



Got my eyes on this money

And some good weed burning

Buying from ya, you got it grand

Going hard is not an option



Now these niggas acting jealous

'Cause they feel like they ain't shining

And they little shit stop

When it's big shit popping



[Incomprehensible]

Gotta keep it in my system

60 box of Cigarellos

'Cause I blow it by the onion



Pack up some dollar bills

Send some paper to my younging

'Cause he just like Steve Francis

He be playing with them rockets



Whipping on the wheel

Got my peddle to the medal

'Bout to hit another city

Ain't no point of getting settled



Straight onto the plane

Ain't been home in so long

You think it's my cologne

But it's money that you smelling



Eyes like my father

Can't stand my older brother

Got some niggas doing years

'Cause of funny niggas telling



Nigga, I'm a be grinding

Till the day that I expire

I've been running through the batch

Till I'm the last man standing



Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'm a go hard

Go hard or I'm a go home

I haven't been there you know in so long

So goodbye



Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'm a go hard

Go hard or I'm a go home

And no I'm not there

It's true them other dudes don't compare

See I got girls a few I don't care

When I see you, I stop and I stare

I'm not some player

Or just some guy

You like my swagger 

Think that I'm fly

You caught my eye

Across this club

I'm way pass drunk

I think I'm in love

And you my drug

I need you most

I take you until I overdose

Come here get close

And hit this smoke

If you want 'scape

Then we can get ghost

If you want go

Back to my crib

Get interested

Won' see how I live

Some peace and quiet

To get to know Wiz

Before we slide

You need to know this

Puttin your nails all in my tattoo

I want you bad as hell and that's true

You tell me what a playa gott' do

To make you understand a mad dude

If you end up lettin' me bust you down

Before we slide you need to know this

Yea
Gettin more scrill, deal or no deal uh
Yea, chubby bags
Heavy hustle, course the gang, uh



[VERSE 1]

On, and on, and on, and on and

We just drink and smoke until the morning

You're homegirl's texting you, ignoring them

Hit the weed, giggle a little, then you get horny

I hit the weed, get on my mission, and then I'm goin' in

Knowin damn well they got boyfriends

Till they get the front door, asked her which floor I'm on

I'm at the top, polo socks and pajamas on

She smoke chronic, know the lyrics to all my songs

It's like I died and went to heaven, me and all my dogs

Thats why we sip champaign till the bottles gone

Roll weed on ya take the bitches, I don't follow ya'll



[CHORUS]

I can never make up this if I wanted to

It's real talk what I'm saying to you

I don't wanna wake up, knowing just one thought of you

Got me fallen I can't get up (get up)

So will you co-star with me?

Cuz my life is like a movie



[VERSE 2]

Champaign parties in my hotel

Her friends don't even smoke, but they diggin' the smell

Ex-boyfriend ringin' ya cell

But every effort to save you's to no avail

Nuttin but starter's on my team nigga coach fail

And all we do is get high and watch the dough swim

Relatively fly like a meteor or spaceship

Party every night, and early morning get wasted

All the way 100 you others niggas are make-shift

Roll that rapper weed, you smoke and don't wanna taste it, lets face it

She wanna fly where the planes is

Got her testin' out all of my trees, mint-flavors

She ?? the paper



[CHORUS x2]



[VERSE 3 - Kev tha Hustla]

We stay smokin' that la-la-la

Easy rider, joint roller, my 9-5

You can prolly smell it in the car when we ridin' by

More like all the way up, we ain't kinda high

We more than fly, introduce you to the gang members

That's taylor, like blood, no gang members

No names enter, and now you on champaign land

I'm on an island of hard liquor

it be fans, joint lit, and guitar pickers

Goin' nowhere for awhile, I got good snickers

Now you wanna mingle, heard young single

Big face chips baby, stack my pringles

You call it tight, I say well-fit

And we ain't takin' no prisoners, now you jealous

In ya state please make sure the weed great

Fresh produce, purple and green crates

Groove, crisp bills in my jean pants

Telly room prolly doin' the Uncle Snoop dance, yea

Verse 1:



Little nigga, big money, big dreams

Tall nigga, small nigga, big team

Small team, 5 o' 1 fit jeans

Some say my life can't be all that it seems

Big things, big hoes wanna go back to my spot, they say how my shit gleams

Remember when I was a little nigga, fifteen, it's funny how I've grown, yeah my money kinda long

[yeah!]

And your girl know the words to every song, 'cause ima star

Different week, ain't no tellin' where we are, look up I might be gone

[yeah!]

The man goes to get that cash and, cash and, move it, I see through them lights flashin, flashin

Ain't no need to even ask it

Chorus:

No matter where you go,

Run up screaming, 'cause they know, your a superstar!

Your a superstar!

Verse 2:

Got bright, grind hard, got paper

Got in the game and got more haters

My whole swag got grown, got tailored

Hop on a plane and talk to y'all later!

[yeah!]

This good weed man, my blunts not flavoured

My whole gang Gucci frame, Chuck Taylor

We ball hard like the majors

Probably 'cause we major!

You gon' have to front page 'em

Wild like a loose animal, they won't cage 'em!

Now I amaze 'em!

Everytime I answer a front center stage 'em!

Blame a nigga that pays 'em

Ridin' with a bitch body on her, that's Cajun

Couple hundred dollars on these Air Hardy's frames, believe me!

My future so bright, I need these, excuse me



Chorus:

No matter where you go,

They know who ya are,

Run up screaming, 'cause they know, Your a superstar!

Uh-uh
Yeah bitch! Haha
That's what I like to call...
My type of shit!

[Verse 1]

Yeah, forward progression niggas got it backwards

I'm relevant but nothing like you other rappers

You see I fuck with trap niggas because really, I'm the only one rappin'

Get it how you live, survival of the fittest you should know the code

All I got is what I give until they overload

Nigga, I'm the shit overflowed

And I grab a blunt split it like a chromosome

Uh, I'll have it where you're bitch ain't phonin' home

We done blown the whole oak gettin' our stoner on

Ain't gotta say shit, I know you don't

See my chain, make the same face from Home Alone

All this good weed that I'm puffin' got me feelin' like there ain't a place I can't go

Ain't a thing I won't do

And I'm awake so I guess my dream's come true



[Chorus]

And the game gave me a feeling that no one can take away from me

I said no one can take away from me

On the road doin' shows oh no one can take away from me

I get a feelin' that no... one... can take away



[Verse 2]

Uh...

Down to take a trip my nigga what's the ticket hittin' for?

I got some hoes that wanna roll too (Haha)

And if you wanna see what it's like to be just the team, and tired of the background so you make your own scene

I'll hit you up when I roll through

Yeah, California weed keep ya pissed off in your mind state

Hard to get it on it so my niggas boost the crime rate

It's obvious I'm ghetto so they love me like I'm Kid Rock

Try your luck with what's around my neck and get ya wig chopped

Fuckin' with I can get you so much cash, or nowhere fast

I got your bitch in awe, she never flown first class

Or had the driver get her bags

I'm money affiliated
Speculated me landing, musta got me mistaken with lame niggas
Know you gon get high as fuck as long as the planes with ya
Let that major situation lone and became richer
People talking down, but see me I'm the same nigga

Leave ya bitch around, we gon drink the champagne with her

We don't touch the ground, See a cloud with my name in it

Only easy riders squeeze no cigars for me and my gang

Fool I'm a legend in dese streets, that's how I do my thang

And don't wear the fitted, I got the city on my chain

Arr man... Still they hated talk smack knowing if I was gone, there'll be no throne to throw ya rocks at

Cruising maximum altitudes, I'm tyrna top that

So in touch with the real, them suckas tyrna stop that

But I... Live or laugh die, Party get high and tell dem lames to the plane and let fly



Don't know what they hatin for, Just getting my paper

Well Maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone

I don't wanna leave but I need to

It's Such A Shame(shame)... They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)

They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)... They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)

They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane) I tried to believe you, I don't wanna leave but I need to



Uh... Stuck alone in this way of grace

Say I'm living too fast, don't plan on changing my pace

Got one foot on the gas, It's neva in need for brakes

Smoke easy riders with hash, Fuck bitches from outta state

Valet bringing my cars, a waiter to bring me plates

Shrimp and Filet Mignon, We celebrate buyin drinks

With a couple of broads, my niggas and who got love for me

It's lonely at the top, I'm tired of having company

So while you busy tyrna fit in, I'm a stand out

And view my life thru this lens and see how it pans out

Substitute teacher ass niggas need a handout

Middle finger screaming fuck dem niggas who hated

I'm money affiliated

Pop another bottle that chronic smokin degraded

Speculating me landin, musta got me mistaken

I'm speaking as the captain of the plane

You'sa runner on the jet way



Don't know what they hatin for, Just getting my paper

Well Maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone

I don't wanna leave but I need to

It's Such A Shame(shame)... They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)

They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)... They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)

Look nigga I'm the rawest, the mo'fuckin' animal
Want war? One phone call is how I handle you (whew)

On the grind, you pussy nigga's hate

Bitch I'm out in different states, politic, and gettin cake.

Fill my lungs with the best weed, pockets with them doller signs.

Run with them niggas holdin glocks like it's columbine (pop, pop, pop)

I'm a star, ain't a choice hoe I gotta shine

Far as Pittsburg, I'm the voice so I gotta rhyme.

Grind all the time ever since the 1st day

Now I'm gettin cake like every day became my birthday

Something like a earthquake, the way this shit drop

I be at the tip top posted with a big knot

You didn't know hoe you sit at home and just watch

Less then haters, stone cold spectators

Same lame's turn out to be investigators

No where near comfortable need extra paper.



Got the city on smash, the streets on lock

100 real niggas with their heats on cock

Got my pockets on swol still need more gwap.

Plus the hood says they love to hear the young boy talk



Ay ay

The jeans spent about a buck 45 on them

If He trick the team, buck 45's on him.

When we hit the scene, the club hoes just pile on him

You scrubs show them groupies love, I just style on them."

You can tell that I'm somewhere in the building on my Batman shit
Niggas suspended from the ceiling

Not really, but that's the way the weed got me feeling

Got a low rise in Venice

Mami you got the vision and I see it HD

And it couldn't be any clearer

You should be with Spitta

And you know that this your chance, don't blow it like birthday candles

Good guy Spitta keep his name outta them scandals

It's not a secret, I prefer my girls in sneakers, never sandals

Posing naked in only a pair of Nike Vandals

Bottles pop, back to back

Extra large chronic sack

Cellphone, camera's out

Mama I remember that

Anytime I look at that

I go to wondering where you at

So baby where you at

With it

I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly

And maybe we get back up in a minute

Listen, if you with it, get in

What you sipping

Hit it out of the park

That's if you pitching

First you look at me wrong

Like uh uh, no he didn't

Then you turn into rubbing on me

You start to give in, get it

By the beach, watching tennis

Crack another bottle of Perignon

Louis V carry-ons when you visit

Sending all them singles in your sidekick sentence

Then I reply like be there in a minute

Just put me and Curren$y on your friend list

The weed come from a village

Truck tire, sour diesel scented, that's real shit

From smelling this she wanna see how the cigar taste

We lighting reefer bumping 808's & heartbreaks

Skinny broad but out them jeans she got a heart shape

Skip the movie date and take her to the horse race

And let you bet it all keep the winnings

Young entrepreneur give you the business, dig it (Yeah)

Boy you know it's a shame



Pop da smoke like pop out

And I'm pimp all the hoes call me papa

Gucci, Chuck Tays, I don't fuck with no prada

Fresh off the plane and I'm smoking like High time

It's better to be a star

NY I'm coping them weed jars

LA my hoes got medical weed cards

And my swagg through the roof

I hit the mall a boutique and tear down

See what I got on you want to wear it now

Think I'm a drink on her when she get tainted

Married to my money so she think I'm taken

She keep beggin me to creep

I heard your song I can do better in my sleep

All my niggaz rumble some bang better with the heat

Better keep the peace

There's Ink everywhere you see

And I only smoke good weed

Only where designer man

If I fuck with baby girl she gotta be a 9 or 10

Swaggg...



[Chorus]



Last night I made a bitch forget all about her man

The reason for them guts in your garbage can

I roll expensive spliffs

She fuckin me for free but for you she's one expensive bitch

Keep blowin up my sidekick knowing I'm at the studio

Another couple thousand everytime I do a show

That meanin I'm really eating

And everyday of my life is like the weekend

I wake up to good weed and new clothes

Go to sleep with more money and bad hoes

One of my 3 phones buzzin through my sleep

I know you heard of my name I'm buzzin all through the streets

YEAHHH... And I be with bosses

Get your shit togethor nigga or count your losses

And incase you ain't get the potrait

Told him since the early teen, all I seen's the color green.
He say it aint nothing wrong; probably wasn't listening.

Listening, Out of town where any of the paper be.

Grandma tell me go to church, somebody need to pray for me.

So I leave and go and see the preacher he said, ""holy smokes.""

See I'm nothing like you; my pockets got the holy ghost.

From that side of town where you can get it for the shorty low.

Fuck about a price tag everythings affordable.

And my homie told me, ""You a nigga, be a rich one.""

Why you on yo ass? You ain't got no money? Get some.

Shit, if I was a book, I'd be all about a dollar.

I never had a job or something of that nature.

I've been hustling since a cub, had a buzz like a pager.

You straight from the path and I'm on one that's narrow.

I'm chasing muchavo, that mucho deniro.

Fresh like a Pharaoh. My clothes come from Caro.

Big money, small money

Short money, tall money



Soon after we locked eyes,

I had a vision of me inside.

I stimulate your mind and give your body everything it wants.

Private school her whole life,

Got an infatuation with being bad.

You take her out to shop and spend it all,

Cause she don't see them tags.

I get deep inside her soul though,

If she was a guitar I'd treat her like the solo,

And pull my fingers through your hair.

And last night was amazing,

I could honestly say that you're the best I ever had.

And you don't remember cause you weren't even there,

But your soul was.



Keep goin, just catch up on the next one.

Ay.

Ay, ay.

Ay.



We don't make love, I touch your soul girl.



She don't party where the rest go.

You need to be able to let your hair down,

So you can feel good.

Girl you can buy your own drinks, drive your own car,

Purchase them louis bags on your own.

Her parents money long,

But since she grown she'd rather spend yours.

I get deep inside her soul though.

Go into the drag and beat it like I'm bolo.

And so you think it's too much.

And even though now you figurin out how or what we shouldn't have did,

To your friends you'll admit that we have fun.

Okay, okay.



Ay, ay.

Ay, ay.



Let's ride to the gate so you can meet the mayor.

I'm gonna a beat top man,

I'm gonna take you to never never land.

When you're all dried up,

Here's an ocean to wet the sand.

Of course I'm gonna see what's good with your fancy car.



I'm relighting in the dark, to her lock I got the key.

And niggas down to get a copy.



Damn.

How does it feel this great when you're not even here?

And you climax with the thought of me,

That mean we gotta be"

See the same things twice, nothing like me though,

Man they can dream, flow like a whole key low.

Stacks for them guccis like, fuck it I'm a need those

Top down, and I'm flying like an eagle,

Tats on my neck, face, hands like a cholo

All about my green, bout my green like cheelo

Me I got a plug, good drugs when I land too

Know I'm underage, not much that I can't do

You don't talk money, that's why I can't understand you

See I'm hot now, going for a grammy though

Think this bitch bad, you should see my Miami ho

Down in south beach, met her at the Cameo

Told her what my life like, took her to the Sagamo

100 grand on my neck, just cause I gotta glow

Never buyin dough, whole zips when I gotta blow

Always dressed to impress you can tell,

I got a bad bitch, her name you don't need to know.

If you can take her off of me, that mean iont need that hoe.

Yea, I'm like the number three, something you ain't seen before.

So we get it smackin once we get back to my vehicle.

I got so much drink to pour and I got my reffer rolled.

Girl, I'd love to stay but gotta pack my things so we can goooo.

They call me sayin they need to know

How erryday I'm working but my life just like the weekend though

And when we in the club the owners gon acknowledge us

Me, I'm drunk as hell, throwin champagne bottles up

Yea, we super stars so the camera crews follow us

And all my diamonds traffic jam, they give you some kinda rush.

Baby I'm a star. You can join this constellation.

Shit wherever I want, can't deal with constipation.

Any chick that I handle, I teach 'em patience.

How not to win the award but be glad for your nominations.

If getting money is the case then I'm guilty.

Need a shower. Filthy.

Wipe me down.

I'm famous all the bad hoes like me now.

They don't just wanna fuck, they wanna become wifey now.

You tryna make a name but me, I got my own cloud.

And I can't share no air space. See I'm so Taylor Gang.

Yea

All this money got me feeling bold.

And niggas starring like they scared the speaker's getting old.

You look decent but your girlfriend's a centerfold.

I keep my mind closed for bitches whose tryn dig for gold.

Big cake, ya'll dinner rolls.

You just sink boy, I've been afloat.

I've been in this game and E gave me the sticks now I'm in control

And I'm playing on difficult.

I'm another plane

New day another ticket

So we smoke til the life

Write my name in the swisher smoke

Niggas know if they don't, then they bitch does

Ros bottles spree until they free my big cause

I tell her that she drunk

She say she just buzzed

Half a bottle later she sayin she in love

Some will say it's the fame, some will say the drugs

Got you losin your brain and doing these things in puuuublic

I'm on some own world, other shit

And you gon have to find some decent shelter to get covered in

If she got no panties on then let her in,

And her set of friends.

Meet the gang, whoa



I ain't gon deny it, I be on some fly shit.

See it and I want it.

Be easy [echo]
Be easy [echo]
Or it'll be a long day
[Wiz Khalifa:]

Hold on, let me light my blunt, man

This shit too easy

I'll do it in my sleep



Yeah!

It's a new game

Lame nigga forefit

I'm well ahead, throwin' bread

You just horse shit

Flow out of this world

I'm in orbit

More chips

So them hoes chase me like Norbit

I'm more sick

No anidonte

High like mandigo

Flow crack & it's dope

Only talk money, homey

I don't understand the broke

Take something from me

Niggas come & bust yo canalope

I'm out here grindin'

Like a pair of old brakes

Hoe, ain't nothing changed

Na, I rep tha Burg all day

Walk it how I talk it so I talk it how I live it

And if you hear me flowin'

You should know it's not a gimick

If the topic real shit

You should know they count me in it

Your girlfriend want me in her mouth

Like I'm her dentist

The icing on the cake

I'm like the glaze, all finished

Majianna scented

Windows up, truck tinted

You better



[Chorus x4]



Skinny nigga

And I'm tat, tat, tatted up

Run up on me

And get rat, tat, tatted up

That's a promise, not a threat

I'll back it up

Pockets gettin' like the old Star Jones,

Fat as fuck

Got my swagga up

Come at me the wrong way

Like what the song say

It'll be a long day

To pass me, you Cassie

Got a long way

And even seein' first

I'm comin' 'round that home plate

Come out to the Burg

You'll see that I got it poppin'

If you real, you fuck with me

Ya'll ain't got an option

See my chain?

They like ""how did he get all them rocks in? ""

Want me on your song?

I'm a need alot of guap then

Breeze home

And he said he going choppa shoppin'

So if you got a problem

So look to now to stop him

That pistol bangin' shit,

I'm on it

And I don't run the Burg, I own it

You better



[Chorus x4]



(Go 'head & get ready to kill yourself, man)

I'm out her slangin'

Rollin' with these hustlas

Tryna get rid of all you hatas & you bustas

Blowin' my smoke, I get right to it

When they play this,

Everybody in this bitch get stupid

I mean, they just lose it

Wildin' like they pissed off

Find you wrong place or wrong time

You can get lost

Lotta niggas mad

But the hoes love it

Yea, the young'n super bad

You can call me McLovin

I'm gettin' in good

Makin' my spread

And na, I'll never extend you with a plate

I break bread

My niggas break heads

And we 25 deep

I see you tryin' hard, nigga

But you not me

I'm fuckin' young stars

There's no question, I be

Hit hard & then I dance on them like I'm Ali

I'm a certified ""G""

So don't think that I'm just rappin' to you, homey

You don't really want something happen to you

You better

I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky) [x3]

Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low



[Wiz Khalifa:]

I said I'm gone, off that brownish drank

Niggas know how I roll, it look like my eyes closed

Hennesey and Hydro, rhyme slow



Nigga, I'm on a different type of a vibe

This a different type of weed, and I'm a different type a high (my nigga, I'm gone)

To a place that you probably never been in life



Smokin' Purple Kryptonite, make sure you curl that Swisher right

'Cause I ain't tryna have this home-grown runnin',

Homie thinkin' he gon' smoke for free, I duck 'em, roll somethin' (then, I'm gone)



In my ride, doin' 80 in a 45 Zone, half a zone

Got me blown, I get more than high



Fresh off of the plane

Head start into my hotel

Weedman in every city, yeah I smoke well (even when I'm gone)



I ain't the only one, all my niggas puff pounds

Swingin' blunts 'round, sun up 'till sun down

My eyes low, and my words are getting slow

Niggas askin' me what's wrong,

I blew some smoke up out my nose, and said I'm gone



[Hook:]

I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky) [x3]

Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low

I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky) [x3]

Booshe hoes be borin' us, she gotta be about it

A zombie, I make her give me brains till' she stupid

Who we glue to me, money talks was taught to speak fluently
Its nothin new to me, sometimes it takes three blunts to get through to me
It only took me months to get through the streets,
but when you got beats and your lyrics are dumb hard,
nobody gotta let you in the game you just bombard

Yeah but niggas are gon hate though, no matter who you are there's another wantin your place bro

Mind on cash roll the grass and fade slow, learn fast to mow the grass, the snakes low

A look past the love some niggas ain't sure, made me my own man now I do my grown man

More advanced a young'n nearly in the game, shit lookin better now but I remember the rain



Rain,

I still remember the rain

I still remember the rain

I still remember the rain 

I still remember..



Feelin slept on knowin I'm the best songwriter or freestyle ill bite a niggas head off

The flow was ill before I inked the deal I signed cuz a flow like mine needs a mill

I grind for real and that's no days off you work hard for it and its gon pay off

You can rap you can work a j-o-b or duckin the policeman cars tryna pump weight off

See I was taught to get it how you live, niggas know wiz has been about his bread

In the stu(dio) I'm a beast I can speak to em all day in high school have what u need in the hallways

Stuff long benches with raw haze attention is nothing new its true I've been that nigga always

So what u sayin

Remain the same with fame I gained its good now but I remember the rain

Ya I remember the rain



Rain, 

I still remember the rain 

I still remember the rain

I still remember the rain

I still remember..

I like to welcome y'all to rock with PG's youngest ball
From the bottom of the pot, yea i'm the Pitts of the Burgh
With the kids on the curb, and small time, is pitching the herb
I'm back, and those who didn't previously know what i'm crack
To the people, i'm legalized the lethal

We all got problems involving the root of evil

But they caught me non-dodging, long arming the people, yup!

And for the record, I ain't no half stepper

I rose from the city of steel, the streets greedy for real

Cats chasing their paper, thats basic

Mathematics, hate to run the streets but took a staff at it

As I look back at hard it seems

I remember when this music thing was all but a dream

But i'm here for my city

And can't name no one that's near fucking with me

I'm 'bout to make history"

Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told me

Listen close here youngin'

See I've been doing this here the most fed coming chea

And not a dude that a post here frontin

See niggas pay attention to mine

You listen and find, you gone hear something

I know

Niggas wanna know how I came up

He only 18, they see him stacking his change up

And alot of niggas chose to get in the game

But difference from you damn pricks

The prince was hand picked

The young guy is about as fly as it can get

They want I, cause I supply and demand quick

I'm C4 explosive is how ya man spit

And I got a seat for anyone who can't stand it

I ain't chose the game, the game chose me

A lil fame from the rap, but still the same OG

Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey

But always making sure they know me

That's when the game told me

But always making sure they know me,

And you know

I can't get enough, its like I got a fetish for it

Too many wack MC's for me to just ignore it

I get on track simply to flood the state with heat

Stack my cake and eat, preaching more then they the streets

Seen them teens drop out the bumping the corner

Money and order, so they don't even want their diploma

Me, I'm tryna make a company owner

So while that may be tempting, this rap shit is bringing the ends in

And some say that (what?) there will be no one greater than him

One day that (what?) non believers, I'll convince em

I'm more of a leader and eating like I'm supposed to

Talk by the older dude, stand on my own two (yes)

And I'm deep in the game, not like I toasted be

I get somewhere if a lane, they took over me

Somewhere down the line, the grind molded me

Its so sick and this what the game told to me



[Refrain]



Now ima take you back to 97

I put in work to grind better

I was now with a rhyme fetish

Aged quicker, and seeing things in a different way

Was fourteen when I figured I had some shit to say

So I let it be known

That the tighter with top spitter

I'm coming for em, ready to own

And if somebody better let em be shown

I'm a competitive dude, plus I'm ten steps ahead of you fools, they say



[Refrain]

I ohhhh, I choose you baby

See I ain't choose the game, the game choose me

A lil fame, but still the same OG

That when the game told me

Ohhhh, I choose you baby

Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey

But always making sure they know me,

[Intro:]
Even though I'm in love, sometimes I get so afraid
I'll say something so wrong, just to have something to say
I know the moment is right

Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high

Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high

Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high

Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high



[Verse 1:]

I seen you from afar

Nice frame and your braids long

Gucci bag matching your frames ma

And like a don I approached you

I'm not the player type

But if you play it right

Ma I'll coach you

I'll put it down how I'm spose to

A popular dude

But I'm tryna to see what's poppin with you

Know a little bout the kid cause she's been watching my moves

Got my picture on the wall from when I popped in the news

And true

I been runnin' the town

Lot a chicks thought I was nuttin

All of a sudden, wanting me know

Doing research and hunting me down

But never mind the stuntin'

Trying to see what's on your mind and something

Got a place to unwind, it's nothing

Have a wild discussion

I'm a roll some of this, ride n then puff it

Yea, we start off slow, then kick it in gear

Off of that smooth shit, I kick in the air

To keep the conversation



[Chorus:]

Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

Right, you better know she get down, you know

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)



[Verse 2:]

Here I go, putting myself out there

Really trying to see what shorty about here

Nothing to doubt here

See what you get

Get what you see

Me I keep it 100%

Never see myself loving a chick, you might change that

And if not, I'm happy being the same cat you

Think it's a shame that, that's how it has to be

But you with another dude, that'd be sad to see

You still mad at me, some high school tragedy

Seeing how I played your home girl who had it bad for me

I'm like woah, slow down baby, and

Kick it with your man itta go down crazy

I wanna get to know ya

Talk to ya hold ya

And them places you ain't been

I wanna show ya

And she gone' let the kid handle his biz

Off of that smooth shit I kick in the air

They keep the conversation



[Chorus:]

Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

Right, you better know she get down, you know

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)



[Verse 3:]

I hit your girl with that slick talk, won't see her again

Drop the top, let your hair go, free in the wind

Now we can go and get a room on the other side of town

Or give me head in the whip if you wanna ride around

Roll up the koheeba getting blunted by the pound

I made it to the top, who thought I rubbled from the ground

Bird city, who holdin it down, me and my man whiz

Hit the club, Buy the bar, we let the champ fizz

Knockin couple of brauds you know the plan is

We call the whole crew, and then we ran trillz

I'm so street I feel a part of the canvas

Hard knocks University the heart of the campus

And you know I got my PHD

But that don't stand for player hating

That's a Pimpin Heavy Degree



[Chorus:]

Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

Right, you better know she get down, you know

(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)

Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I

Hit the ground runnin', a hustler til I meet dirt
Gotta be consumption I'm pumpin', the people need work
Love the niggas frontin' I came from nothin' and seen worse
The long-armed khalifa reachin' with each verse
I got that food for your thought, plus what the streets thirst

And you can ask around the haters'll know,

I'm tame with the flow, I'm sorta like the jaeger and blow

I see the dream like a martin luther,

I preach to the constitution in peace,

But violate it, get that ass annihilated

I'm on the grind, money is time so why waste it

And everything but my piss clean, I'm high maintenance

You niggas are weak, sweet like one of them now-and-laters

The canon blast your candy ass if you try and hate it,

I made it, cause I stayed a couple steps ahead of y'all and

A hundred percent, since Benji got the bread involved I'm,

Lovin' this shit, come fuck with the prince,

I'm leavin' heads hollowed like them things stuffed in the clips

And the streets gon' remember this cat name, I'm beatin' the rap game

Just like nigga huggin' the strip (why?) 

Cause that's how a hustler do, fall back I don't fuck with you,

We make it happen the clappin' know we can scrum with you

Yeah we can take it to the heads, give you a lump or two

A fool is still, team bring heat like a oven dude 



[Chorus: x2]

Ladies stand up, gentlemen stand up,

This is pure skill, far from damned luck,

You gotta make a plan to never give your man up

And man up, to positively stand up



Once again the youngest sin came to drop the hammer

How could a bystander feel that this is not bananas?

We earn stripes, you all hype in that propaganda,

Gats spot, you cats shot, but not from cameras,

Back glock, cause snap shots'll stop your plan up,

Stuck in my ways, the haze taste like Tropicana,

Thinkin' the days of way back, people will say that,

The youngin' was gifted sick when he stayed back

Now the people listenin' play back, I got it made

Obligated to gettin' passin' grades and blaze tracks,

You'll be amazed at how I make units move

Self-made, twelfth grade, boy I'll take you to school

I'm through the streets of pistolvania where my goonies move,

? can't miss these trucks with the rims on them

And you can find me speedin', listenin' to big and em,

Fresh outta class with the weed tucked in my timberland's

It's Wiz Khalifa man
This shit hot, right?

Now don't blink cause the flow is closer, don't think

True diplomat, no Jim Jones and no Pink

And the city wanna know what, except that I claim

Blackout be the gang, it's attached to my veins

And I don't got a problem giving naps to Elaine 

Order every syllable, every rap to my name, ye

The grim reaper came back with a cane

That's me, spittin' crack to your brain

Niggers, they can't stand me, ladies, they demand me

Damn your man's handy

And I'm the mayor when I blam with them hands 

Have you seeing stars like you walk with them Grammys

Your reign was short, I'm running it now

Knock your teeth out for biting, now you be gunning my style

I keep it, honey I'm selling them, I'm the blackout

Put my sneakers to your face, you'll be running your mouth



It's too late nigga

It's too late nigga

Man, it's too late

Y'all niggas ain't early enough

It's my time nigga



And some say I'm contradictory

Cause I flow nice and spit I mean, trying to get green

Play it how I split teams

You'll be sixteen, storming nigga sixteen

Six two, feeling glock with a sick lean

Big dreams, only two words, get green

Which means never had no job

I spit, to keep it simple, the truth like no lies

No god, I know why

I make it clear, there's no reason for your life

And I make it ahead, see me speeding and blow by

You dudes fake, I see through you with closed eyes

And won't stop, till they can get rich

And make pay from the rap I spit

It ain't hard to tell, like a snitch, that I'm next on deck

And care less about who making the pay

Listen, it's too late



It's too late nigga

It's too late man

It's too late

Y'all dudes fake, pray for me

It's my time nigga



You catch rabies if you bite this hair

Safe to say I don't like to share, ye

You see I'm what the ladies want, so they like to stare

I'm a beast, I eat tracks and bite the snare

See I got blind eyes and they like the glare

Dudes hate cause I rock shit they like to wear

And I'll battle anybody who can fight the fan

Spit, crack, put the pipe in their ears

And my boys have the nigga broke down in a second

Shots split a clown into sections

Round your protection, I'm back at it like a crack addict

The fact I spit crack dog, I'm ass-backwards

I lay it down, bring a clown to his knees

See, we be a truce in D, ye

And niggas faking like they kicking cause they moving them keys

But if I shoot you I be doing a deed nigga



It's too late

It's too late nigga

It's too late man

It's too late

Y'all niggas ain't early enough 

It's my turn nigga"

Seems that you're runnin around

Every night late comin home when I call

And I don't know what to do

Cus I feel like you're lyin to me when I'm askin you

Sometimes...



[Wiz Khalifa:]

I hear you talkin to me

You sick and tired of the kid man

Sometime you feel like you talkin through me

That's when you walk up to me

Trying for attention

Ma listen

You wild'n Stop trippin

Cus a nigga work too hard too long

Always got a show or in the studio doin a new song

Them other dudes could'ntwalk with my shoes on

Still I come home hearin bout what I do wrong

Pullin stunts and

Rollin blunts

With my dudes from the hood

But to you they no good

I'm just doin what I could

And that's givin the circumstances

You only get one shot at these certain chances

Instead of trying to find dirt

And where your manners

Try and understand when that work demanded

And no mama that's not a punch line

I'm always there when it's crunch time

But still you say

Sometimes I don't know if you're tellin the truth

Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do what you do

Seems that you're runnin around

Cus I feel like you're lyin to me when I'm askin you

Sometimes...



[Wiz Khalifa:]

Now I know you hear the he say she say

Your home girls got my every move on replay

Scream'n how you know niggas

And the games that we play

But all the while I've been grindin for this weeks pay

Hustlin each day in order to eat right

Call me sayin she need me in order to sleep right

Not really knowin what these streets like

So you stay up until I come back

A nigga love that

Help me relax

Warm plate an the dub sack

And after that proceed the bend the back

Then I'm back to politics the usual

And sometimes I wanna talk to get through to you

But... Damn...

Sometimes I don't know if you're tellin the truth
