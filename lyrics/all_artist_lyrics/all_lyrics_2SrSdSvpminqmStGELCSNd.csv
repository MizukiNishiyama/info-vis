A fire from this perfect match to burn us to the ground
And even though it's cold outside
It's probably best we pray
To lead us from this drought
If your love is my Holy Water

Girl, just let me drown

And even if you don't, it's fine



I guess you got me figured out

We got that champagne love, don't let it fizzle out

I know I brought a world of pain you could've did without

If you was livin' with me then I'd probably get a bigger house

And we standin' by the water, do we drip or drown?

Running 'round in circles, bro, just let hеr walk

Listenin' to Lessons, that's a lesson taught

Sеcond guesses really got you havin' second thoughts

Second thoughts never hurt nobody, everybody has 'em

Give you orgasms, more than you can fathom

Think we missed the touch even more than we imagined

If I saw you right now, girl, I wonder what would happen?

Orange G-Wagon, you can park it on the drive

I was meant to be there when you're startin' up your life

You make your people proud, you're a star in all our eyes

With your apartment in the skies, I scarred you with my lies, the

Karma isn't nice, you said, ""I hope it doubles back on you""

When I double back, I never double back to rattle you

Hate to see you leave but I love to see the back of you

I take you out to eat then after that I make a snack of you

I'll never put my hand on you, still the biggest fan of you

Good for me like collard greens, and runner beans and callaloo

Every single day I close my eyes and try to channel you

Drive through memory lane and then I see you by the avenue but



It's probably best we wait, it's probably best we found

A fire from this perfect match to burn us to the ground

And even though it's cold outside (And though it's cold outside, it's probably best we)

It's probably best we pray

To lead us from this drought

If your love is my Holy Water

Girl, just let me drown

And even if you don't, it's fine (And even if you don't, it's fine, it's probably best we)



Holy Water, can I bless you with it?

I ain't spillin' all my truth to try and stress you with it

I was workin' on my flaws to try impress you with it

And you don't believe the growth but, yeah, I guess you're with it, right?

'Cause fire and fire just makes flames

And water and water just cause floods

You said you're tired, you're tired of these games

You said you're findin' your calling, I call bluff

And you ain't gotta lie 'bout the reasons as to why you left

Just know the man I am today is not the guy you met

I give you the space you need to give your mind a rest

That's the least you deserve, too deep for a verse, my weakness is her

If you ever change your mind, I beg you speak to me first

Was meant to tell the kids about the bees and the birds

Guess I couldn't keep to my word, word



Please, stay, don't let me go

I know your heart is breakin', oh, oh

These days, the kids on their phone

Maybe we're all forsaken, what do I know?

(What do I know? What do I know? What do I know? What do I know? What do I know? What do I know? What do I know? What do I know?)



It's probably best we wait, it's probably best we found

A fire from this perfect match to burn us to the ground

And even though it's cold outside

It's probably best we pray

To lead us from this drought

If your love is my Holy Water

Girl, just let me

And even if you don't, it's fine





It's probably best we wait, it's probably best we found

A fire from this perfect match to burn us to the ground

Burn us to the ground



I can't put out the fire

(It's probably best we wait, it's probably best we found)

(This fire from this perfect match to burn us to the ground)

I can't put out the fire (Burn us to the ground, the ground)

I can't put out the fire

My pride gon' let me burn us to the ground

I can't put out the fire

I'm gettin' tired, pour me water (Pour me water)

I can't put out the fire

My pride gon' let me burn us to the ground, oh, no

I can't put out the fire

Cut from different cloth and different calibers

My skeleton is matchin' with my managers'

Hangin' off the banisters

Tell me, who's gon' pay for all the damages?

Ah, I'm just reckless, like the mandem is

Talkin' recky, we gon' ask you where your manners is

I said it from a kid, you should've listened

I manifest the shit and then it happened

Said that I'ma do it, then it happens

(P2J up on the rhythm and it's slappin')

I shout my brother Giggs, that's more than rappin'

Shout my sister Mel, we doin' fashion (Sheesh)

Ah, all this work that I've been mashin'

Put your boy in the position where I profit off my passion, alright

They don't know about the times I've bled

Give a fuck 'bout what the timeline said, I do your day streams

In a second, yeah, I shine like Ed

I thank God for the life I've led, then get the Wraith clean

I heard them say that grime ain't dead

I'm Harry Styles, the way I fine-line tread, you're goin' mainstream

Mind your business, 'fore you mind my bread

If ten milli' weren't enough, I make a lifetime pledge, alright (Boy)

Uh, I can't address your niggas on the 'net, they disrespect

They don't wanna give me my respect, it's disrespect

A nigga doin' numbers, what the fuck did you expect?

They charge a nigga fifty every time I miss the jet, ah

I guess I overslept

If she hold me down, then I might buy her a Patek

The mandem hold me back, because they know just how I get

Please don't hold my money, man, just wire me my check



I make a pay from your mother, 'cause it's lots on the beach

White bitches rollin' in the deep

Nosedivin' off a yacht, into the sea

Blah, still I keep the blicky on me

She buy the whole house (Yeah, go), fuck a centerpiece

Y'all gon' have to pay your respects, it's off the check (Um, alright)



I don't do things the rapper way

All that cappin' on the net, I'll make the mandem blew a cap away

So we just let them niggas out the way

I think I'm Kanye mixed with Donny Hathaway

I heard Sunday's the new Saturday

We praisin' God, I watch my enemies evaporate

Hallelujah, to be honest, I could plan and do you

But I gotta rise above it, word to Dan Kaluuya

No chance, buffalo stance on my Neneh Cherry

They wanna see the Michael that they see on telly

You man just remind me of my girl, why you never ready?

I'm the G.O.A.T., but that ain't nothin' I ain't said already

Oh, please, all my enemies are dead and buried

I need that Häagen-Dazs, I need that Ben & Jerry's

If we do it, then we do it large, I'm on my Kevin Perry

My kettles all gold, my presidents are Black (Bah)
See, Jacky on the front lines and Richard's in the back
Remember when they told us just to rap? Hmm
Over the years, we've been ill advised
They told us ""Just one at a time"", that's the biggest lie

A wise man once asked ""Who ate all the pies?""

And now he's lookin' at me funny, like I took his slice

Oh, what a life, if I can't war with no broken man

They start worryin', they've got wars to plan, hmm, aight, cool

Jigga told mе ""Crabs in a bucket"", I said I overstand

So you my brother, you can hold my hand

You wouldn't know about thе convos that we had to change the rules

Didn't know that I would give my arm and leg to help you move

Didn't know we're tryna implement our history through the schools

You can keep the gems, I give you jewels, aight

We are the needle movers, we are the table shakers

They gotta move around us, 'cause nothin' moves without us

It can't be you who found us, we don't need you to crown us

I had a crown before my song, this is the mountain that I'm on

We set up shop, but never closed the shutter

I give you all the keys, don't matter if we know each other

My brother Enoch told me ""Bro, you wasn't known to stutter""

So I got rid of it, I'm smoother than some cocoa butter

Fluent, you can—, it's the community provider

The multiple diss track survivor, glory be to God, Jehovah Jireh

How can I retire? The devil is a liar

And shout my nigga Dave, 'cause we made it through the fire

Should've left me out the politics

All I know is fetta cheese and dollar chips

Niggas went from sellin' weed to scholarships

They're billin' me to holler flicks

And know they holler flicks to get at me

I could be a Beatle if you let it be, I needed you to set me free

Woo, I just needed you to let me dream

The pressure that I'm under does no favors for my self-esteem

I wonder what they tell Rahim

Black boy fly, black girl fly, we all fly

If you try to rob them for their dreams, of course I'm

Gonna put a target on your back, I'm Hawkeye

Beg you, leave them yutes alone, this is my war cry

Just careful when you fuck around and take the piss

That could be my little bro, baby sis, have to make a statement, just in case it is

We're products of the place we lived

Yeah, we're bustin' all your favorite myths, nowadays, I pull up on my Zadie Smith

A master with a pen, skin-tone darker than your skeng

Ah, you'd have to pull it up and start again

Tell Michael Grove that we got somethin' for your nose

And we got champagne bottles for them boys at number ten

Oh, we gon' party through the bullshit

If you make a point, I'll reinforce it

If you take a stand, then we endorse it, that's what we do

If we ain't beside you, then we're cheerin'

This is #MERKY, this is God engineerin', I swear

Woo, this for my niggas who ain't make it to the prem'

Hope they see the bigger picture when they frame it through their lens

I pray my brothers make it in the end, to be fair, we never had no olders

This for my Kofis and my Adeolas, you get the trophies when you plan and focus

You're now tuned into my magnum opus, they wanna chat me whilst they sat on sofas

But I'm Serena for you Sharapovas

Win again and win again, like Wimbledon, I serve

I promise you, I'm colder than the single that you heard

The second one was stressful, but it's simple for my third

Holy spirit, guide me to the things that you prefer

I'm still the nicest with it

Go put some commas on the check and try and 'tice us with it

Put some rockets on our back and put some fire in it

This a blessin' from our king, you can't acquire spirit

Hit 'em with the choir spirit, got 'em singin'



Give me light, give me love

‘Cause we’ve been through the figot the strength of a lion, oh

Oh, yes, we will, Lord

I'm a young Jazzy B, I'm on my soul to soul

They're askin' if I sold my soul

Tell 'em it's the power of the holy ghost

Tell 'em that he guides me on this lonely road

So that's why I say

The road that you go on from now, is what you're payin' for the ladies

It's this road for all these people to walk

And I think that's what's gonna be one of the greats, legacies

That, you know, to get from

The black English

It's like a full circle, we came all the way around"

I'll do anything for you 'cause you're my main squeeze

Anything for you because you stayed G

Our promises, I promise that I will keep



And it still cuts deep but it's mad love

'Cause when you had it that good it's never bad blood



News and the blogs and the sites never bother us

Oh, please, girl, it's obvious

I love you out loud, nah, it's never been anonymous

Can't you tell I love you, girl? It's obvious

We ride or die, you and I, just the two of us

Had pride and it ruined us

It came at cost but the odds never bothered us

Can't you tell I love you, girl? It's obvious



Just keep holdin' on

Just keep holdin' on

I guess there ain't no way

They tried to tell us that we can't adjust

Everybody's talkin' culture, but it starts with us

And to be fair, I could've parked the bus

Niggas tearin' down my wings, like it ain't hard enough

Was it beginners luck or was it blood of Christ?

They said that it's a fluke, so then, I done it twice

Me and Toby due to up the price

Thank God we never listened to your dumb advice

I gotta listen when my shepherd speaks

Bible studies at the crib, oh, they gon' let me preach

Tightеr than the stitchin' on my leather sеats

Heavy is the head, I haven't slept for weeks

I check the time on my Patek Phillipe

There's no time to kill, they wanna see me rest in peace

Couple man are cool, but the rest are neeks

We paid you niggas homage and we kept receipts

Niggas walked through the door and didn't leave the key

I treat Dave the way these niggas should've treated me

Every handle needs a Stevie G

I done it back to back to back, I'm on my DBE

I put my phone on DND, super necessary, niggas never keep it brief

Generation, all they do is pray and tweet

Reparations, we gon' feed the streets

I still believe Jehovah's gonna free me from the shackles of my troubled past

And way before I juggled bars, a nigga had to hustle hard

All I ever wanted was some kettles and a couple cars

I was at my lowest when I bought myself the double-R

The things we do to cover scars, thirties comin', but we young at heart

Tell the EDL we didn't come to march, the documentary's gotta come in parts, yeah



Finally, my eyes can see

There's sun behind my rain, there's colour in my pain

I may fall down, feet don't fail me now

'Cause through the storm, I found my smile



Yo, I think I got my smile back

The last time I linked depression was a while back

Me and loneliness kick it from time to time

She knows the deal, that I ain't hers and she ain't mine

Me and joy got tighter, that was overdue

Paranoia doesn't shout me, but I know the truth

That nigga doesn't feel me since I quit the weed

I shout my nigga purpose, that's my realest G

I told love we should build a home

I told self-doubt, you better watch your tone

Stop shoutin' down my line, like you gon' do shit

You was my old friend, but now we on some new shit

Me and suicidal thoughts, we haven't spoke for years

You know all my deepest secrets, you know all my fears

I pray that I don't ever see your face again

Like me and peace of mind became the best of friends, my nigga, ha



Finally, my eyes can see

There's sun behind my rain, there's colour in my pain

I may fall down, feet don't fail me now

Man wanna diss and text in private

Them man are cool, but the rest not nice

I'm not scared of lions, bears or lion bares

Them feds won't find us

Man's not scared of crips and spiders

Think man's scared of sex and cyphers (What?)

What you talkin' about? I'm skilled (I'm skilled)

What you talkin' about? I'm real (I'm real)

Put a fork in your mouth, I'm thrill (Too thrill)

Big Mike bought a house in the hill (Right there)

No, I'm never in the trap, and I'm never with the strap

And your nigga ain't out on the field (No way)

They say I'm on this and they say I'm on that

What are you talkin' 'bout, I'm build from the ground up

Put your arms down, put your crown up

You came a long way from playin' Counter

You got your motivator all rounded up

And the kettle cost thirty bof, that's why they givin' me dirty looks

I don't do it for the 'Gram, but I do it for my fam'

And I do it for the Merky boys, 'cause we're still takin' up space

I told my niggas rise up

Guess we're just a bunch of young kings

We made our city light up

See the fear in your eyes, man are scared of the flow (Yeah)

Still man of the year five years in a row, I

Still don't do police

Cah they act like they care when they do the least, and

Every time I drop a new release

Gyally pull up to my door like I'm Uber Eats, I flex

I let the fool boy do the deets

When I'm tourin', I do the streets

It's all calm 'til you're caught on a rope for your stupid tweets

And then you act like you're new to beef

I thought I told you



Young, black, fly, and handsome

Burn down the rave like I'm Rachael Anson

Peng tings wanna hold me at ransom

I go booth and make an anthem

I just drop the heat and do tour

From Amsterdam to New York

You won't bust your gun, you a dork

Go suck your mum through a straw

'Ight, calm down, don't get defensive

Oh, this flow is so expensive

I can't let you niggas rent this

They shall try and reinvent this

They shall try and they will fail

All my G's, they buy and sell

Rude boy, I should be in jail

For these riddims that I push through my clientele

Alright, look, I'm young, black, fly, and cool

Think that's how I got by in school

Man get books, start buyin' jewels

Them man get shook, start buyin' tools

Oh, man, you bunch of lyin' fools

Rude boy, diss me if you dare

Then she whispered in my ear

Said, ""Gunshot Mike, we've missed you bare""

Rolling in the deep, I need to breathe better

Having visions of my friends in RIP sweaters

Have you ever had to sacrifice your health?

Ever had to sacrifice yourself?

Plus I got a army full of dickheads tryna sabotage my wealth

But I know it's self-destructive if I bang 'em by myself, wow

Like God hold me down till I'm downed

God, hold me down till I drown (Hold me down till I drown)

It's like I nearly fell into the ground

By the hold blood of Christ, you don't ever let me down

Lord knows I'll be back up in minutes and disappear

Wonder if I'll flip like my mandem, just disappear

My brother looked in my face and said, ""You're not better""

I said, ""Give me two secs"", build it spliff, take a hit, reminisce

And then I bet I feel a lot better

Man, I used to spend my time on the roof

It weren't a penthouse suite, but I was fine with the views

What you do with your pain? I put mine in a Zute

Then I smoke it all away to take my mind off the truth

Was a troublesome youth, had desire for war

Bought my mummy a coupe, she nearly cried on the floor

Spent time in my sneaks or spend a night in my thoughts

You walk a mile in these, I walk a mile in yours

Ah man, all the things I been battling through the years

Wonder if my bro woulda made it if I was there

Tryna scare us with some things that we are no longer afraid of

Men are superheroes, let me see you take off

I pray you never take your cape off



Even though more time we don't fly straight

But trust me, bro, I promise we gon' die great

Our burdens are heavy but we ain't lightweights

Our parents were legends, they had to migrate

So that's the reason not to sit around and chat shit

I'm from the place where Michael Dapaah made a smash hit

Where you can be a rapper if you rap sick

They're screamin', ""What a flippin' time to be a black Brit""

We so alive, whole world want our demise, but know we ride

Try to push us all to the side, we know our rights

Now we get the whole of the pie, then go inside

When we see that Merky flag in the sky, just know it's 'ight

The way I top the charts, would've thought that I was Dave

I am young, black, beautiful, and brave

Know that it's fucked, they overlookin' what we gave

I know shit's all good so we pray for better days



Pray they're better than before (Better than before)

Young, black king, you are everything and more (You are everything and more)

I know one song's not enough to settle scores (Not enough to settle scores)

But from the bottom of my heart, man, I hope you're gettin' yours (Gettin' yours, gettin' yours)

Man, I hope you're gettin' yours (Get yours, get yours)

Young black queen, get your shine on

All I see is innovators and a bag of icons

You can go and ask the whole world where they got their style from

That's you, that's us, God's time and He never gets the time wrong

I guess we're just some ticking time bombs

We'll soon blow, boom



I can make my world come true

All my dreams will see me through

And if that won't get me down

My dreams will turn things all around

With a smile upon my face

I can see a better place

Doesn't matter what will come my way

Believe me now, I will win someday"

I lost my heart, I just wondered if you could give me one?
I hit you back, you know lately I've had some busy ones
I been getting this money just on my Lizzy ones
And now we're acting like children, it's so pathetic
I was trying to reach out for ages, I need my credit

There's a couple lines in our script I think we should edit

Why you gotta bitch all the time? Just read my message

Shit, fucking hell, I'm such a handful

On one hand I'm pissed, but on the other hand I'm thankful

Times when it was bliss and there were times it was a shambles

Times when it was lit and other times we lit the candles

You're probably reminiscing when you could be hella dissing

Never been the type to be so reckless with decisions

Swear you tried to tell me but it's like I never listen

And I was meant to share your vision

I was meant to be your rider, put a bit of Henny on my rider

You can stay at home, I'll send a driver

I'll be your provider, no, I'm not around but it's a minor

Cah I don't like the spotlight and you don't like it neither

But that was then and this is now

I was pacing 'round my kitchen like this shit is foul

I done the dirt and then I figured that you'll dig it out

But that's a coward move, I guess you got me figured out

I know you'll never listen now



You taught me love (You taught me love)

Oh, what a gift (Oh, what a gift)

I know that it's hard (I know that it's hard)

Too hard to forgive

And to be honest if I were you

I'd be the same way

To be honest if I were you

Then I'd be unforgiving too



Fast forward now, my nephew's still asking for his Auntie Maya

Guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya

I just stood and let it burn, I couldn't down the fire

Lord, I pray you make it easy, that's my one desire

God loves a trier, I can't even fathom what I probably had you going through

You cannot imagine how I'm sorry, man, I'm showing you

Now I haven't even got the luxury of knowing you

We was even meant to share a seed and let it grow in you

I can't even look you in the eye, that's 'cause of shame

Now you're tryna block me out your mind, that's 'cause of pain

Greatest love I ever knew, I poured it down the drain

Maybe it's the only way we both call it a day

You gave me the world and then I gave you disrespect

Hand on my heart, this is my biggest of regrets

Thought I'd say it here than rather fling it in a text

Until you're ready to forgive I'm always wishing you the best but



You taught me love (You taught me love)

Oh, what a gift (Oh, what a gift)

I know that it's hard (I know that it's hard)

Too hard to forgive

And to be honest if I were you

I'd be the same way

Then I'd be unforgiving too

Then we laugh about it and split the prof

Check one-two, man skitzed again

Dickhead you and a dickhead crew

Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends



I think I just got dissed again

Think I care who this offends

Run up on man like Bale with a-

Slap that through your shit defense

And I can still get a box imported

Said don't worry about the beef it's sorted

My man said he's a real gun shooter

Then my brother said rah, that's awkward

My mans never been bad that's bullshit

Two weeks in the top 10 who called it

Christmas, I went to war with the corporates

Like big ups the ones that caught it

They said you ain't gonna blow like that

Who gives a fuck? You know like that

Ice in my cup come cold like that

Woah, we ain't even close like that

You know my style, know my stats

Don't talk bad if you don't talk facts

If I sign now what's the buyout clause

1 top 10, 5 sold out tours

Might fling a mixtape out when I'm bored

My life's okay, how about yours?

Brother, I'm good, I stay with the lord

Bible carrier, that's my sword

Matthew 12, so I don't talk

John 19's why I never got caught



Call me gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng

Check one-two, man skitzed again

Dickhead you and a dickhead crew

Getting gassed up by your dickhead friends



Back now damn I've missed the pen

Had one shot you missed the pen

Bad man yutes, with their bad man ways

What they wish for me, I don't wish for them

I don't pay them fools, never been told

Robbing phones outside Elliott School

Let me get a little bit of Henny, I'm cool

Many have come but many did fall away

What? You thought I was the one?

I was fourteen trying to buy me a gun

Most niggas doing what I did back then

So, now I thank god for the guy I've become



That's gunshot Mike or Mr Skeng

So we rest in pride

And it kills us slow

But bro I don't need all that

'Cause if that boy looks back, it'll hold him up

Man are out here beefin' like we ain't broke enough

Swear these bruddas ain't woken up

Yo gang
(Yes my brother)
You still don't sound sure
(Na, na I'm in the booth right now, right now)
(I'm in here right now)

Alright, let's start then

Alright look, let's just get one thing clear, I don't fuck about

I am the certi' one

I am the one that they call 'Gangster of Grime'

I don't like it but I don't mind it

But I need everyone to know, and I'm not just talking about the hood, I ain't just talking about the basics

I'm talking about the whole island of this country, needs to understand what is about to happen

If you put all bias aside, Stormzy has to be Neo, he has to be

So therefore that makes me Morpheus so I'm telling the council right now

This kid, no joke, you can hate him all you want

This kid has to be seeing the game in zeros and ones, like, it's not normal, it's not normal

So #MERKY, #PROBLEM, #WICKEDSKENGMAN

(Mad bro)

Na, I like that one, no I like that one

And I don't even know what a hashtag is, I just know it's proper Merky

You know a hashtag's a bit more advanced than me

But what people do need to understand is, you see anyone from my era of grime, need to recognise

That if you cannot fathom that this guy's about to take it from a second rate genre to a first rate genre

Then you need to look at yourself and be ashamed, seriously, you have to be ashamed

Because we started from the roots of this ting

(Word)

Now we've gone past the roots, it's a whole digital age, we don't need the middle man

Mr. Smith is nearly obsolete, we don't need those label ones again

(Word)

We can actually just shot it ourselves and cut through

So everyone needs to understand that when I'm telling you, and I'm certi', my name's Crazy Titch, I'm definitely one million percent certified

I know certi' guys from all over, Brum, Manchester, Notts, Sheffield, Leeds, Manny, Liverpool

These people all say the same thing, 'We don't really even know what grime is but we know who Stormzy is'

You know like, so, I don't wanna hear man say 'I'm too gangster listening to Stormzy'

Shut up, that's a lie, you ain't

You know them ones right there

(Hahaha, word)

It just means you're a hater, na real talk, it just means you're a hater

You know what, that's what it is, this is my opinion and it is my opinion, I don't care what no one says

Real talk, those old guys that don't wanna bring him in

Whatever man, fuck yourself man, you know like real talk

(Mad brother)

Get a Coke and a smile man, seriously, don't play them round there, know mine brudda

All them other side crap guys better just shut their mouth, you get what I'm trying to say

Yeah man, there you go

Like ""yo Mum, book a flight, go now""

Talk to my face, don't talk to my palm

Had four bills and I bought a new car

Little red whip that I bought for my marge

I straight murk, it's a walk in the park

I take care when I water my plants

These MCs wanna talk about Lord of the Mics

You ain't even lord of your yard



Dead MCs, blud, leave me alone

But plaques won't help me find my heart

Devil's in my ear I need you back

Got scars in my soul I've been attacked

Even when I'm low I seem relaxed

But then year's been mad I lost my way

They think I went ghost to drop my tape

Not knowing that I fell and lost my faith

Like Satan please no, not today

So fuck this shit this ain't a joke

Just to get away I take a toke

I took this pain and made a boat

Lord knows how the fuck it's staying afloat

Weren't for Flipz and weren't for rhymes

Weren't for Rachel, weren't for Kelly

Like bro I can't believe I saw my dad

Still up in the ends, still driving cabs

He said ""Yo son, I need a car""

I kissed my teeth and turned my back

Like ""Nigga, you ain't seen my face for years

Nigga, you ain't seen my face for time

And the first thing you're asking me for, is that?

Fuck you! That's where I draw the line""

Should've dashed through a rack like ""Keep the change""

And fuck letting go, I'll keep the pain

23 years I'm still the same

When you hear this I hope you feel ashamed

Cah' we were broke like what the fuck

Mum did well to hold us up

But yet she still forgave your arse

But mumsy's cool, I'm cold as fuck

Fuck that! I'm still not over this

Fuck that! No, I'm still not over this

Flipz told me someone died in Heath

Like ""Please say I don't know the kid""

When I heard TS, I kissed my teeth

And then I broke down in disbelief

My bro TH and Yogi too

Man I'll be damned to miss the streets

But I still got old school friends that I shoulda' been cool with

Man that I ride for, man I went school with

Man that I love and man I kicked ball with

My phone's there, just call it

But I guess things just got strange for me

But you all grew fast and gracefully

Left my hood and grabbed the mic

And I got me a girl that prays for me



One more time I'll make it clear

I said yo brother, this is bigger than me now

I need to provide for the team

I need to give notes to my sisters

I need to buy mumsy a fan

And buy yards for the mandem

I do this for Elias and Brandon

So don't ever try tell me I'm selfish

I do this shit for the ones that I love

I do this for my bros cause they got me

Yeah, I do this for the ones that I trust

But nigga a change is coming

Yeah that's way overdue cause mumsy's account was way overdrafted

Yeah I've got so much to prove and there's so much to do

But I know where I started

And I know where I'm heading, yeah, look, I've got nothing to lose

And I'm still out here grafting

[?] has taught me a lesson, I told her I owe it to you cuh

Boy, this shit's been a struggle ever since we were kids

Coming home late, not even a penny to my name

Wouldn't even bother looking in the fridge

I ain't ever been the type of guy to complain

You don't even ever me rapping 'bout pain

Yeah man we've all got demons

So I can't hold feelings, I just knuckle up and then I pray

Just imagine if I didn't buss that case

Just imagine if I caught bus that day

Mum's life, I was in a rush that day

Swear man I'll never lose trust and faith

So sorry if I come across angry

If I love you there's no need to fight me

I'm just trying to be all that I can be

I just hope I bring it home for the family"

You say you've been waiting for me to be your highness
Now I'm yours for the taking, so let's make this timeless
Forget those that are hating, you know they admired us, yeah
Girl, you the baddest
That's why I'll give you it the way you never had it

You keep it real, hold it down, let me see you turn around

Yeah, you got me in the zone right now



You've been on my mind

Let's do this right

Girl, take your time

You're finally mine



Oh, let's make this last forever

Forever, yeah

Forever

Forever

Oh, let's make this last forever

Yeah, forever, oh

Forever

Forever



Look, can we make this last forever, please?

Your slim waist in those denim jeans will take care of my enemies

So I pray, my aura and my energy

Gets outshined by that Hennessy, still get it done, yeah, that's any means

And that's faith, we had love, I turned cold and left you broken

But you turned back cuh the love cuts deep and I let you breathe but you left me choking

And we all know that you had my soul when I had yours too but I still weren't coping

Feel like Frank would, fuel in my tank, got one more mile to the ocean

Then you come along but the summer's gone and this thing might take some time

All those summer songs and those Jägerbombs and that day when I made you mine

You're not blessed but you say you're fine, I could swear that's your favourite line

All that I need and you're all that I see, let me help you breathe, let me save your life

You get caught in a whirl when you talk to your girls and they say that I'm bad news

You get wrapped in their words and it actually hurts cause we both know that's not true

Girl, this love is ours and it's no one else's, it's time that we both take charge

If we get it right then we'll never die, I just hope we can make it last, yo



Oh, let's make this last forever

Forever, yeah

Forever

Forever

Oh, let's make this last forever

Yeah, forever, oh

Forever

Forever



Yo, can we make this last forever?

Can we make the world spin slow? Let's work it out till it's better

I would never let this love grow, then you say never say never

And you kept me warm in the snow, with your tush as light as a feather

You said I was close to killing us both, we both know love's so painful

You came in my life and you made it alright and for that, man, I'm so grateful

Girl, this love is ours and it's no one else's and you need me to survive

You can light the way or return the flame, I just hope we can keep it alight, yo



Forever

Forever

Oh, let's make this last forever

Oh, let's make this last forever"

Bun down the dance then I send man home

You can check my bros

Some of them buss gun, some of them go uni

Some of them go church on a Sunday, some of them mash work with a uzi

But none of my mandem are fruity

Yeah most of my mandem are unruly

Smoke with Dee, he said, ""yeah man it's peak the rap scene now relies on you""

He said ""you know I'm not lying, it's true""

I was like ""where's my Fire in the Booth?""

Check my stacks, I was that boy in the corner, little black boy with the strap

D's in the trap, putting down a brick into quarters, nigga get corned for your chat

It's mad, man can't text me again

Tryna make dark skin sexy again

Word, see me on the road with my bros, feds can't make man talk

Never had a whip, never had Ps for a cab, couple man made me walk

Then I hit a lick, gave man food on the tick, couple man paid me short

Caught him in West, he was tryna buy some creps, beat him up in JD Sports

I laid his corpse, rude boy lower your tone

Couple pagans try follow me home

Said ""Yo Merms, can I borrow your phone?""

G, come link me at the end of my road

My Gs them tell man cool, get that done, rudeboy leave it to us

Quit my job, mum bugged out, made my choice, this is my life

And I swear down I can't do this alone, may the dear lord be my guide

We've done some things, wouldn't even know where to begin but the dear lord knows we tried, so it's alright

[Verse 1]

Like, where do I start?

Most of these man weren't here from the start

Stay for the sun, disappear in the dark

Stay clued up and stay clear of the sharks

Shoutout [?] who was there in the park

Said this year man are clearing the charts

All these girls shed tears on my heart

Tryna find one that don't care for my past

Still no bites, just bearing em bark

That's why I'm still not hearing em talk

When I hit a lick then I share it with Mark

I'mma be the one take care of my dargs

Summer '010 was there in my yard

Them times there, yeah, my hearing was hard

Snakes in the clique, there was bare in the grass

Can I get the mic, man? I'm raring to start

Heart's too big and it beats too loud

Jump on the stage, go and do me proud

Don't you ever let em see you down

Don't you ever let em take your crown

Give a fuck if they're easily pleased

Thank God I've got a reason to breathe

Suddenly I get weak on my knees

Think I've got the dreamer's disease

And this shit's gonna kill me

Yeah, this shit's gonna kill me

Damn



[Verse 2]

Yeah, this shit's gonna kill me

All these sleepless nights and these cheap-arse flights

It's mad, my nigga, do you feel me?

Been through a lot but I'm sure that I'm still me

Well, maybe I'm not but it comes with a cost

I just hope it's the real me

I can't wait till they six-figure deal me

Dreamer's disease, man, I think that I caught it

Sold me the dream and I went and I bought it

I can't even afford it

Should've payed safe, put it straight to my mortgage

It's too late now, can't-can't turn back

Time's one thing that you can't turn back

So please listen to the words I rap

There's been vision every verse I spat

Heart's too big and it beats too loud

Don't you ever let em see you down

Don't you ever let em see you down

Don't you ever let em see you down

They say that we dream too big

They say that we've lost our minds

They say we've got the dreamer's disease

And I tell em that keeps me alive

I think you got the wrong impression

I need a hand to help me count my blessings

You always told me I ain't learnt my lesson

Girl, you ain't gotta stress no more

Ooh baby, can you feel my presence?

Girl, you ain't gotta stress no more

And if you can't stand up to him, just phone my phone cause I'll make that stand for you

How dare he, how dare he, tell him try that shit on me

Tell him try and pick on me, when I heard that news, man, it made me freeze

And I said forget all this, but how did it get like this?

Cuh girl, you were strong for me when I was awful weak

And I'm stressed and shit and I'm bugging out

You gave me all that I needed

And you helped me fight all my demons

That day when you held me tight when I was bleeding

I told you ""wake me up if I'm dreaming"", you said ""babe, just keep on breathing""

I feel like I owe you this, and you just act like this is cool

And let him take you for some fool, with your back against the wall

Girl, I can't watch this shit, cuh when you're hurting and I'm hurting

And your burdens are my burdens, I'll grab a rope if that bridge is burning

Just let me help, just let me save you like how you helped me to save myself

Let me repay you and girl, you know that I'll do my best

To see you stable, put that halo back up on your head

My fallen angel, all the times you could've walked and left

Feel that I'm grateful, girl, all of the crazy things I said

That shit's disgraceful

If I could take it back, I'd give it all to ya, bring the world plus more to ya

All the stuff that I swore to ya, yours truly, your Stormtrooper
