So I came over, we were supposed to watch 500 Days of Summer
I brought some Macallan 18, I brought some Jordan SBs, and 6ix turns over and says, ""Hey, I think I got a beat for Ultra 85.""
He plays it, Logic goes crazy, and next thing you know, history's made
I'm Paul Rodriguez and I approve this message
Heh heh heh, ayo, this that Tony Hawk Pro Skater soundtrack type-beat

Welcome to Ultra 85! (Woo!)



What's up, what's happenin', bitch, we live

Probably thought you'd never see the day of Ultra 85

It's been a minute, but baby, yeah now we in it

What's that? The past, the present, the future, and yes the beyond

I know you thought it was over, but you know it, now it's on

I was scared for years to try to do this album

How you follow up a classic, what's the outcome?

Failure and tragedy, now everybody's mad at me

Cause I ain't make a carbon copy of my last shit

Fuck the past, we past it

Boy snappin' like he elastic, listen

Feel the freedom, you can take 'em out the field and lead 'em

But you can't make 'em drink, bitch I'm being me, the fuck you think this is?

I am, I mean I, I mean it's everything that they said I wasn't

We cookin' but ain't no oven, they say they hate me, I love 'em

Come now boys, sound the alarm, we brothers in arms, fuck that beef shit

Y'all riding away, fuck that weak shit

Fuck all the shit they be talking about, we practice what we preach

We walking it out, no ain't no doubt, no no, I'm on the grind like Rodriguez according to what he says

This shit don't happen overnight, they said Logic wouldn't be nothing

What an embarrassing oversight, yeah sure, you right

I'm keeping it tight like in that pocket like that '95 Roots Datskat Skibidi-hoop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, stay with the gat

So don't test me, better arrest me

Used to want hip-hop to love me

'Cause when I was a child both of my parents would neglect me

I talk about it in therapy often

How in this game, you gotta have thick skin, she said let it soften

Be yourself unapologetically 'cause in this world that damn right there don't happen often

I'm smoking 'til I'm coughing, self medicate to the coffin, 'cause in the end we all six feet

So I'ma be catching wreck to the day I die on these 6ix beats

You emcees better retreat

Cut off my legs below my knees and still can never defeat me

Black and white like 88 pianos

Lord of the Rings, my right hand look like Thanos

Hairline like Fantano's rockin' a yellow flannel

Y'all can't see me like Metal Gear Solid with the camo

This the freest I've ever been, critics don't let him in

I graduated from the bullshit, pass me the letterman

Me and my entire team focus on being better men

Logic in the thirties, but he rappin' like he in his Prime

Goddamn, we're the veteran

This is braggadocia at his finest

We been through a lot of shit but deal with it then put it behind us

The rhyme is the illest

Let's take a look at the skillest

Yeah, I'm the motherfuckin' greatest

I'm confident, never cocky

Don't talk to me 'til you made it

Debated all you want

But we know this shit is off the hook

Slidin' on this bitch like Paul with the Nolly flip the crook

Motherfuckers don't know nothin' bout the hustle, bitch, I wrote the book

I'm a prodigy, I leave them shook ones that know me know how much it took

Back rank checkmate with the rook, I feel like Magnus

Logic on this beat is murder, bitch, I'm toe taggin' this

Ultra 85, this the catalyst, that real rap shit

Lo-Fi, boom bap on that trap tip, now watch the hat hit

That SV and 96 at the shelter, goin' batshit, no Bruce Wayne

Oh yeah, you know this rap game produced pain like I did Fahim's album

I made so much fuckin' money, should call this the green album

They used to be laughin' at him, now they outback after the show rappin' at 'em

You lazy motherfuckers ain't doin' shit, up and at 'em

Oh man, get after it, get at it, don't none of y'all want this static

Why you actin' dramatic? This ain't no Gangsta Grillz

I know you up in your feels, cause all the legends in the game respect me, I keep it real

I remember tellin' Funk Flex, ""people call me a tryhard""

He said, ""you know why, dawg? 'Cause they tried and couldn't do it""

So that's what is it, yeah, and every time they see you winnin' they have to relive it

Oh yeah, now come now boy, forget it, we with it

I'm goin' crazy committed, that shit they talkin' omitted

We takin' it back for these hip-hop heads like fitteds

Said it, I did it, yes I said it and did it

If you hatin' on Logic then we all know you ain't hit it

I provided various people with jobs like I was Steve

Kill the beat then let them grieve, I kill the beat then let them grieve

Tell me the reason I'm ripping it up in a microphone 'til I can't breathe

This is deeper than the things you can achieve

This is deeper than the chain around your neck

This right here 'bout catching rep

And murdering it every single time you put me in your deck

This that TASCAM-four-track straight to cassette

We independent now, putting major labels in debt

Bitch I've been wet, no PCP, you know we be free

Fuck the algorithm right now, I need that reparation

They call Logic the voice of a generation

Sipping scotch, face in a blunt

Sometimes I talk about the real shit, other times I stunt

Sometimes depression takes a hold and rips away everything that I want

We finally eatin' but I'm still hungry

I know you feel it, you hear it, the passion

Swoopin' like an assassin, gats blastin' like it's regular fashion

I'm driven, you better fasten your belt, spit heat 'til your face melt

I'm one-of-one, these other rappers were made on conveyor belts

Watch yourself, Logic wildin', man, I'm not myself

This for Nas, this for RZA, this for Jay, this for Mos, this for Thought

This right here for Kanye, even when he be wildin' out

Man, I listened to y'all when I was broke and I ain't had shit

Y'all were there for me even more than my dad, shit

I can say the same for Drizzy Drake, Kenny and Cole

'Cause we a family, this hip-hop tree is all I know

And you listen and are invited to help it grow

I can't believe it, used to wish I could achieve it

Never thought the day would come that I would see it

Not the money, not the fame, not the cameras

Not the chains, but the happiness

It makes me sad that so many in the game will never truly know what happy is

I used to think it was the streams

Used to think it was the plaques

Used to think it was awards

But none of that there facts



You know what it is, homie (This right here)

You know what it is, homie (This right here)

You know what it is, homie (This right here)

You know what it is, homie (This right here)

You know what it is, homie (This right here)

You know what it is, homie (This right here)

You know what it is, homie (This right here)

You know what it is, homie (This right here)

You know what it is-



Logic be wildin', T-Man right there he gon' style and you know I'm going bezerk

Everybody want it all but don't wanna put in the work

You want that? My heat work

You want that? It's teamwork

You got that? The dream work, no Pixar

Worth a hundred million when it's all said and done

Yeah, the basement was the kickstart

It kicked us to the stars and beyond

I do this for my wife, little Bobby and Leon, my son to be

We took him to outer space then we took him to the Wild West

I created this universe because I was depressed

Feel like I did not have a space to call my own

Fuck a tastemaker, gatekeeper, hip-hop's my only home

Blacklisted by some, top ten listed by others

This that summertime, Kool & The Gang, me and my brothers

Taking it back like primitive, tell me now who gon' let 'em live

Shit, like Hov said, can I live?



Ayy, check it, this that Lupe in '06

This that Lupe last week, this that timeless flow

You better listen when I speak, I'm at the podium snatching mics

Like I kidnapped Jackson, lights, camera, action, blunt sweet passion

See if you ain't get the message now, this whole song is about passion

This is everything I got, it's everything I have to give

If that ain't enough for y'all, man, fuck you, I'm happy

My dick works, you name it, I got it

I don't say that shit to brag, I say that shit to let 'em know

Kid on welfare and food stamps really achieved the goal

I made 30 million dollars six years ago

This ain't about the money and the fame

It's about the fucking flow

The love, the music, the people, the drums

The happy, the sad, the highs and the lows

Let me repeat this so all of y'all out there listening know

The flow, the love, the music, the people

The drums, the happy, the sad, the highs, the lows

The shit that most of these people do not know

I'm doing this shit cause I love it and I never won't

I make music for those who love it and not the ones who don't

We're tracking you now, uh

Airship there, we got the Aquarius III and uh, we got ya

We're all clear here, Thomas

Before we had an issue with one of the doors earlier, but maintenance came on down and fixed that up

Alright, Tom, that's everything on my end, here

You're clear for departure

I'll tell you what's up I'm getting real sick and tired of this synthetic gravity so I hooked- oh my bad



So, you're my new partner, huh?

Yes, sir. The name's William Kai, first officer and man of infantry, and I take it you're this vessel's new captain

Yep, that's me. Quentin Thomas. Pleasure to meet you

Hey, Roslyn, please tell Mission Control docking sequence was successful and the Aquarius III is now commencing separation

Of course

Roslyn? Did they update the fleet's AI program again?

I know, right? Feels like as soon as you get to know them, they're on to the next

Initiating thrusters for departure

Munitions check

Quantum cannons engaged

Mission 1019 go for departure. Star date 2110. Mission Control has given access granted. Emergency systems green and fuel is 100%

Well kid, you ready to do this?

Well if I can be honest sir, this is my first time leaving Babel

No shit? Well, don't worry. I brought music"

Let's fucking go! (Now, now)
Come on (Ah, ah)
Yeah
Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Yeah yeah, ayo, ayo (Now)

Open up the rhyme book and read the composition

I can truly give a fuck about the competition

I'm in another atmosphere, I'm on another mission

Yeah, you know that boy Logic put pen to page like a petition

You a bitch, always switching up your whole position

I can see it in your face like an esthetician

Food for thought, this the highest caliber nutrition

Everything come out my mouth, that's my own cognition (Now)

I got out the hood, then got money in addition

I remember when that boy ain't had no pot to piss in

They wouldn't lеt me in, so I never askеd permission

Tour is like a war, I'm getting minimum fought[?], no permission (Oh)

Uh, hit the ignition and peep the emission

Self-medicate like a clinician, more than a musician

My flow rare like a first edition

Report for dismission, everything I ever thought of, it came to fruition

King of the transition

We never switchin', peep the acquisition, no omission

Your lyrics drier than the prohibition

Prepare for collision

I'm higher than the sattelite that's on an orbiting mission



I remember we didn't have any permission (No permission)

Never forget we on a motherfuckin' mission (We on a mission)

I remember that they didn't even wanna listen (They ain't listen)

Now we cookin', we ain't even in the fucking kitchen (What we cookin'?)

I remember we didn't have any permission (No permission)

Never forget we on a motherfuckin' mission (We on a mission)

I remember that they didn't even wanna listen (They ain't listen)

DJ Drama (Gangsta—)
Okay, I've been there, I've done that

This rap shit had to get 'round from that

My therapy helping the boy unpack

Yeah, the reason I left and don't wanna come back

Made a hundred million and was still depressed

You know with or without it, we still stressed

You know with or without it, we still blessed

Stealth mode like Ellie in Hillcrest

Yеah, everybody gonna die, gonna go, I know

That's why I flow likе a river, my liver can't take no more

Ain't no more fucks to give, I gotta live my life

Regardless if you think I'm living it right

I was born in the dark now I live in the light

Bitch, I'm ready to fight like I'm Tyson

This shit is enticin', them diamonds on my neck be icin' (Goddamn)

Bitch, I inspired a generation

People that feel like they had nowhere they could belong, stuck in the simulation

Bitch, I am the king of innovation

But everybody got what they got from something else

I'm something else, I'm on the floor, you on the shelf

I'm in the ring, I got the belt, the hands been dealt

I am the king, this shit beyond the bling

And all the things that I thought this rap would bring

Back in the day in the trap, I was gripping the gat

As a matter of fact, I was dealin' with hella anxiety

And now today, well, I still got anxiety (Gangsta Grizillz)

It's fucking with my sobriety and the outlook that I have on society

It could be cripplin', even if your bank account steady triplin'

Because the money and fame, success and the game

Has nothing to do with the life of happiness you plan to attain

Gripping this grain

Everybody gonna die, gonna go, yes, I know that's for sure

Everybody wanna act, they wanna act like I motherfucking fell off

'Cause I did everything but get the Grammy

And I'd rather raise a family, rather be home and off of my phone

And all these other rappers soundin' like clones, leave me alone

You think you got it, better get to praying

Who you know go toe-to-toe with Em?

""Homicide,"" might have to go again

Student of the game, I studied him

JAY-Z, Nasir, and Rakim

Bitch, I got a million plaques, a million tracks, a million racks

A million facts to let 'em all know

That I'm ready to go, fade away, then fade to black for sure

All this shit you rapping wack for sure

Murder like Amity, peep the Calamity Ganon

I stay with the cannon, they talking that shit in the Discord

You know I'ma ban 'em, pull up in the Maybach and never the Phantom

Recorded Incredible True Story in a two-story

Could barely afford the rent, that's a true story

So don't pass it, decade later, it's a classic

What can I say? I guess I won't fade away



All day, every day

We was on that block until we made a way

Day to day, man, that's the only way

They gon' know my name until it fade away (Gangsta Grizillz)

Fade away, fade away

They gon' know my name until it fade a— ('Way, 'way, 'way, 'way)

Uh, fade away

Uh, they gon' know my name until it fade away



They say, ""Damn

DJ Drama don't look like what he sound like""

Ha, you sound like me with film
Cool, I'm a sci-fi junkie myself
Really?
What? Not a fan?

Well, seeing as we live in a giant space station hovering over our destroyed home planet of Earth, I gotta say, I've seen just about all the space I wanna see

I don't know man. I guess it gives me hope

What you mean?

You know, that there's more out therе. Flourishing planets with life and technology and advеnture

I'm a little nervous, honestly. It's my first time away from home. This little ass ship, thinking it's just us out here in space? It's kind of freaking me out!

What, am I chopped liver?

No, Roslyn. That's not what I meant

Kai, it's a routine suite. Nothing to worry about

Man, how many times have you done this, Captain?

Me?

Well, let's see... ah, that would be my... first mission outside Babel

What the hell? What? Oh hell nah! You telling me you never flown into outer space before?

Hehehe... Calm down officer. I've literally been training for years on the simulation deck

Man, I knew your ass looked too young to be a captain

Bro, I'm 47

I'm 38! That don't mean shit!

Look, Kai, it's routine, okay? We're fine

Heh, oh yeah. Nah, I know. For sure

Kai's current heart rate is 128 beats per minute

Bitch don't put my personal information out there like that

Anxiety is normal dude. I've had my fair share

That's the last thing I want to hear the captain say

Dude, talking about it is what helps and, you know, relieves the pressure. But enough. We're fine. Let's take your mind off it. Who's your favorite director of all time?"

And why you're doing it, and why you pursuing it

Is you really happy?

I been all around the world and back again

I'm rapping in a microphone

I'll let 'em know that if you're coming at me I'ma never give up

Give a damn if I gotta live up to every single one of your expectations

I remember the moment of my life

The moment of eyesight, all up in the spotlight, uh

Uh, people think we gotta be the perception, what you need is an intervention

Everything that you doin' better be with intention

I hope every single one of you payin' attention, uh (Uh, all my life)



I used to move a certain way because I was afraid

That I would not be loved the way that I deserve to be

Until the day the fear deserted me, deserve to be free

And do whatever the fuck I wanna do when I wanna do it

When it come to the world and creativity (All my life)

I don't know why I always lie to myself

I'm calling anybody for help

Okay this is starting on line 1 with Thomas on 5th of October here we go

Heavy is the neck that wears the chain

Gripping this grain

Tryna maintain

Feeling this weed through the blood to my brain

Writing these lyrics in the back of the train

Tryna sustain

Through the pain

Benn smoking and drinking a little more than I should

And I would do better but I'm human

Eyes on me like I'm Truman

Escape through the page

Contemplating my age

Poetic justice

For those who trust us

I ain't tryna beat em no we just us

Watch the gat bust

We get bread you get crust

Lovе is a must

World we live in is fucked up

Switch thе position

On another mission

Now peep diction

It's far from fiction

Far from accessible

Want beef? End up like a vegetable

A hundred and fifty thousand people is at the festival

Black proud and louder than decibels

Bullshit no I'm not susceptible

It's not acceptable

The bitch in me is undetectable

I'm too respectable

Conceptual my albums be

In the studio til round about three

Never paid a fee

You fuckin with me? Get it for free

Now let it breathe

Murdering it with ease

Peep the prestige

I spit degrees

Your shit freeze

If I had a, had a penny for my thoughts, then I'd be Elon Musk

Rappin' from dawn 'til dusk, you know in Dilla we trust

Hits never went to my head, I was never concussed

Givin' no fucks, bumpin' Busta Genesis

Waitin' for the first of the month and all of its benefits

Life been a bitch, chillin' with Mad Eleven, tryna get richer

Rather get richer, fuck the paper talkin', bigger picture

Comin' to get ya, now let me hit ya wit' that throwback

The illest memories, PS3 when grenades was gettin' thrown back

Modern Warfare 2 at the favela

Was my escape when I wasn't scrubbin' floors like Cinderella

No glass slipper, pass me the mic, I go Jack The Ripper

I'm sicker than COVID-20, fuck all the money

I'm doin' it how I've been doin' it, ain't nobody takin' it from me

I grew up five hundred and fifteen miles from Seven Mile

But this beat got me feelin' slummy, dummy, ay listen

I never passed 10th grade but I still get the rent paid

You fake, I be real like Cypress Hill

You fake motherfuckers, I can see through you

My game's strong, y'all weak like five plus two

Bust through the door then rush through

Gettin' this bread 'cause the people fuck with it

Your whole shit's stale, wouldn't feed ducks with it

I make firm decisions like a legend stater

My briefcase Italian leather, my loafers is alligator

My bank account is greater but none of them numbers define me

Fuck rap, put it behind me, don't try me, y'all too grimy

Smokin' cigs after dark, we call it Nic At Night

Spark the blunt, watch the Bic ignite, fuck your life

Think you could body me, bitch?

You couldn't even limb me, I'm smokin' dope like a chimney

Jump on the Aquarius III

It's just Quentin, Will, and me

We all headed to paradise, boy, I'm finna set you free

Feel like Vash the Stampede

Grippin' sixty billion double dollars

I'm far from a scholar

But they still ask me to speak to the students in Harvard

""Oh, yeah, what you tell 'em?""

Told 'em, ""Fuck the monotony""

Game a life of Monopoly

Yes, I'm livin' it properly

Yes, I got chains 'round my neck, but first I invested in property

Grew up with nothing, we ain't even had child support

Sippin' a fifth like I just plead it

These fuckers pathetic and copacetic

Woah, even I don't have these specs

Roslyn, computing system version 17.7, out of date

Thalia conversion currently in development

How could you know this already?

Because I am updated by the millisecond from Babel's core mainframe

Woah, this guy's crazy

What do you know about media?

Sir, I do not understand

You know, film, music, art

Hold up a second, man

We've got to do something about this

About my present now, so clean

Grounded like a mezzanine

What's ya flavor, homie?

College Park days, rocking Swaver, homie

Anonymity was free but now they all know me

Fuck the money that I got

Fuck the money that I got

Fuck the rollie that I got

Fuck the fame

Take it all away, now tell me, what I got?

First and foremost, my health, secondly, that's my family

I got tact, I got heart, I got it all but a Grammy

I got people that love me and some people that can't stand me

But no matter what they say I know I am me

I'm a champ like N.O.R.E. in ""Nothin'"", way down in Miami

No, the game could never ban me

I'm a renegade like Em and Jay

Might as well be honest with what you say

'Cause no matter how you feel them fuckin' people finna hate you anyway

This for the kid in a dorm room, with a dream of his own

These haters that try and drown you, they won't leave you alone

But never give up the sight, always remember to fight

You never know what could happen, your life could change overnight

It happened to me, I ain't kidding

Way back in them days, man

Playing Call of Duty online, rockin' with FaZe Clan

I'm a millionaire with a dad bod and a couple grays, man

So keep it real all the time

And remember who you am, who you am



East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this

Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this

All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this

All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this

Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights

No lights, all for this

Tell me what you know about sleeping outside

No ride in the wintertime, all for this

Tell me what you know about commas in the bank

Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this



Yeah, I'm just tryna do what makes me happy

Living by truth, was cut from a different cloth, played by different rules

Had to find a way to cheat the status quo

Still with the static though

Played the corner like Avante Maddox where the addicts go

Wasn't my habits though, I was on a different wave

Played the sidekick to get it, did the Scottie Pippen phase

These days I play it like LeBron

Business cards say I got a white side, I ain't Hasan

Nah, this is educated black playing with me

Get you smacked for a while, been on these Kuvings sipping Azul

But my energy still miles with the yak

I'm sharp as Shannon, you skip cause you skipping facts

I tip my hat to anybody black that made it out the hood

Got they whole family living good from off of rap

We don't get as many options to live as opulent

Bar Harbor shop, take the crew to Nobu while found blue occupancy

A long way from Briggs Chaney, well rolling up bush was my vice like Dick Chaney

I was living insanely, for the money I couldn't attain mama couldn't tame me

She get it now, I count up on her kitchen counter

Two thousand, three thousand, four

Gotta fix her kitchen floor, here go three thousand more

Feel good to step up, make up what she can't afford

In a hotel room, contemplating my death

I been on tour so long, feel like ain't nothing left

It's in these moments that I find freedom

In the midst of a bad day, good thoughts, I greet 'em

When I'm riddled with anxiety, it's hard to find sobriety

I'm being honest now, entirely

Physically and mentally drained

But no matter how life move, do my best to maintain

I could focus on the positive, or bitch and complain

Gripping this fame, feeling like I'm lost in the game

It's hard to see the bigger picture when you're feeling restrained

'Cause everything you dreamed to attain can't fit in the frame

Luckily, your minds a gallery

Full of artistic expression that could fill up the galaxy

It's okay to not be okay

Just don't let that present mood dictate the rest of your day

Children grow up, go to work, then forget how to play

A lot of people that I meet tell me about they dreams

And how they wish they could attain 'em even though it seems

Like it's not a probability

Be nicer to yourself, show humility

While you compare yourself to others on a screen

You could put that phone down, look around, and feel serene

But this thing in our pockets are part of our daily routine

Distraction from taking action

Full of synthetic satisfaction, by dopamine hits

From swipe, likes, and captions

Comparison is destroying your passion

Used to be full of dreams, now you barely have a ration

Yo, listen

If you ain't rich doing what you love, then what's the point?

And it's because of this mentality that you can't pass a certain point

Think of the millions of dreamers that did what they did, then they died

Some were celebrated, others crucified

I'm not saying quit your nine to five

That's unrealistic in this world that we live in, and you must survive

But do not deprive the heart on your sleeve from the blood underneath

Sharpen your sword daily, don't just keep it in the sheath

Wake up every day as if you could relive it

Then whenever you feel negativity come and just pivot

Appreciate the good, and not the bad

Be yourself, and not the fad

It's okay to wake up sad

But it's a lot of people that woke up today in body bags

332,648 to be exact

And you mad that you ain't get that big promotion, fuck that

Man, it's okay to be upset, but don't let it affect your life

'Cause 13,860 just lost they life in an hour

231 in a minute, man that's three a second

Yo

And your heart still beats as you listen

So take it day by day, and make the right decision

Add something to this world, don't multiply division

Focusing on the past is not the present vision

Worrying about the future is just a head-on collision

Live in the now if you can

I find it hard myself, but I'm just tryna lend a hand

I said, I find it hard myself, but I'm just tryna lend a hand



'Cause they can't

Take it from you

They never understood what you've been through

What's life without pushing

They can't believe what you put yourself through

Better hold ya money tight 'fore I snatch that shit

Acting like they got the world in they hand but really got nothing

'Cause they forsaken what it means to be a person

And worsen their mental daily by involving themselves in extracurricular activities

Its apparent my skin is transparent

Only color I ever really gave a fuck about was green

Only people I fuck with is my family friends and my team

20 albums in under a decade bitch I'm a machine

Talking bout you don't like Logic bitch what the fuck do you mean?

Why you listening to me then? Why you watching on your screen?

'Cause I'm all you have in the world at this moment

And the fact that I'm winning and you ain't winning hurts don't it?

You see I know you're not a hater not really not deep down

You just got a lot going on that you keep deep underground

Maybe you was molested, even beaten as a child

And when you see other people this happy it drives you wild

How did I know this? How do I know this?

'Cause I myself was beaten and molested

God drug me through the fire everyday I was tested

'Cause really when you look at me what you see is a mirror

That reflects who you wish you really was but even clearer

And makes you uncomfortable that I'm comfortable with who I am

That's that reason that you hate and the reason that you Stan

The reason that you obsess you're my biggest fan

So my advice is seek therapy and find clarity

I know you hate me but I love you with sincerity

Everyone know you a bitch

Ain't no talking it down, you bitch, you a punk, you a disgrace

Get this money, get from me, get bread, don't get crumby

I'm the one of one, bitches want me

The left, the right, the black, the white

The complication in the game, erasing the name

Pain, what a lot of money bring

Gotta maintain for the gang-gang, for the bloodline of mine

Can only take so much, feel like everywhere I look

The people crook, really wanna take from us

Need a break, need an escape, need to cut cake

But you can't escape the fate

Everybody fake, everybody take

Everybody want what they can't have

Can't laugh, can't have happiness 'cause you's a bitch

Pourin' to they pockets double tappin'

On they watches never stoppin', steady clockin' into jobs

Only option is to rob, I let them rob me of my dream

That I believed could be achieved if he'd just give me a break

To breathe, or is it too late for me?



I don't wanna give up, but it's gettin' close

I went all in and now I wanna fold

I just wanna make it, I just wanna make it, I just wanna make it

I'ma motherfuckin' take it, and I'll take it when I want

Been doin' hindu practice, imagine ajna

Niggas askin' me to drop, but I'ma drop it at my top, bitch, my peak

Got a lot of time to build up my will from defeat

Was too comfy for me at the ground floor, I re—

'Member what was read, I had to jump on my feet

Root of all evil, deceitful people own your green

Protect your heart before they catch wind of the sins that you hold deep

Many put a lot of power in they self-esteem to cover for their sacral needs harming the harmony between

The love in being a human being, I been tryna be the opposite of what I see on my screen

False prophet, profits are toppin' rockets, not tryna stop it

Just tryna give the kids another option before they caught in shots

Lined to be rhymed in a line on a top five

And some niggas wearin' suits are gettin' paid for the crime



Come on, tell me what it really means to understand the reason he wanna make it by any means

Livin' the dream and when you focus on your self-esteem, then build yourself a team

It feel like anything can happen, at the open mic, you snappin'

Started singin', now you rappin'

I remember when I was a young man, thinkin' that I can do anything I wanted

Homies gettin' blunted, I was writin' rhymes and hopin' that I stunted

Never confronted what I really wanted, a mama and a daddy

But prolly both would take, prolly never have me

Even though my mama got that check from government once a month

No wonder why I stunt, I made it out, I never doubt the reason

That I do it, I knew it, move through it, everything could grow

And why you think I gotta put this boy up on the track?

Because you gotta pay it back, matter of fact

The atoms in my upper back have shifted like a chiropractor

Give it back of the line, the rhyme and everything that I find

Every other day, I think about a life away from that, away from rap

I went to hell and made it back

I made it to heaven and my reality full of vitality

Had to bein' why they mad at me

Said it emphatically, rappin' dramatically, shinin' achromatically

Give it to 'em grammatically, rappin' like an automatic be

'Cause that's how the static be

Where I grew up, it had to be

Everybody mad at me 'cause I don't fit in they picture perfect rap category

'Cause I gave it to 'em pragmatically

The rest is erratically

Systematically givin' it to 'em pneumatically

While I'm tunin' new record grammatically

Shit is mathematically, undeniably and enigmatically

Audiomatically me, and won't never be, I know be the only one that ever did it

Like I done the track sixteen on The Incredible True Story

I run it and always will from afar



You gon' be a star, shooting from afar

You gon' be ignited when they don't like who you are

I know who you can be, I know what your plan be

I know you understand me, and I know that you never wrong, yeah, you're never wrong

Shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, I don't give a damn

I'm headed to space with my team in a fleet of flyin' submarines

Submerge a hundred years into the atlas, then we're clean

When we surfaced, there was no need for money purchases

But my Wiz still has Chanel purses

I had a solid gold diamond encrusted book

The sole purpose was to hold important verses

Claustrophobic, they tried to bound me in COVID

But my strand of DNA, it can not be decoded

I told y'all this, put those laser guns away

Before I black out and take your whole sun away

My star cruiser with a flux motor, vodka with the club soda

Ice in the cup holder, Bobby be that type of soldier

That I wouldn't fuck over, turn to a supernova

The rap Galactus, five emcees my daily quota

My shuttle's a dream house, spa with a steam room

Pool with a logo and backyard is a screenin' room

Lookin' out my window, every view is a scenic view

They say life's a dream, I say that you could dream it too

Logic, Logic, yo

They say life is but a dream, but I say that you could dream it too



Yo, Logic, wake up

What, what, what?

Yo, it's like four o' clock

We gotta go pick up Castro, you're performin' tonight

Oh shit, alright, uh, but can we get some food first?

I'm fuckin' hungry as shit

Hell yeah, I'm starvin'

Only pick up the stick if I need to defend

Wonder what would have happened if it all went the other way

It wasn't payin' attention, I was prayin' for ascension

No need to mention my attention to detail

Lot of motherfuckers wanna wake up every day

Then they murder their own, but they know it's another way

Fuck all the violence and drugs in communities

This song right here is immunity

They call it the trap, 'cause they trapped

And just take our money, then they don't give it back to us

Black man can't even get himself a bachelor

Dropped out of school then he picked up a spatula

'Cause he never had a good role model, just a hood role model

Now I know that's the old model, we breakin' that cycle

I think I see the finish line, got a vision now, don't diminish mine

Lot of brothers in the hood doin' good and I know I see it all the time

But they only wanna push all the drugs and all the crime on Channel 9

Fuck all that fallacy, this shit right here for my people

Oh, yeah, uh, a Coke with light ice

Okay, one Coke with light ice

Please pull around to the window on Street 77

Bro, I'm so fuckin' excited for this show tonight

Hell yeah

It's fuckin' crazy

Here's your small bacon cheese, with a Coke, not Diet

And your number two, with light ice

Oh, thanks, girl, can I get some ketchup?

Oh, sorry, it's in the back, one second

Damn

What?

A straight fat nigga fantasy

Fat nigga f—, what—, what the fuck is a fat nigga fantasy?

That fine-ass skinny girl servin' burgers to a fat nigga like me

Oh

(Yeah, yeah, ah, yeah)
It never miss, the flow, it never miss (Ah, yeah, ah, ah)
(You are now witnessing)
It never miss, the flow, it never miss (Ah, yeah, ah, yeah)

The flow it never miss (Ayo)



Ayo, my flow non-binary, that mean it never miss

Feelin' meticulous, I'm ready to get with this ridiculous

Vehiculous sound, that means that I'm driven, illest around

Yeah, they know me 'round the world, but the flow is still underground

Only booze I get on stage is when I sip the finest

Like MF, most you niggas deaf, that's confide

Bottom line, I'm top five, red carpet when I arrive

But most days, I'm feelin' deep, realize

That's a medical term for feelin' out of your body

Like you're lookin' through glass and don't recognize anybody

Like you're not even real, anxiety what I feel

Tryna fix the problem, doctors wanna give me a pill

You know, I still think I could do it without that

These professionals really doubt that

Luckily, I found a therapist, straight from the outback

She's always there for me, when I'm feelin' down under

Most people is too scared of therapy, 'cause it's taboo

No wonder why we all fucked up

Intrusive thoughts hit me on the daily, but I know I'll make it maybe

Everybody walkin' 'round like shit is gravy

Feelin' wavy, but they really feelin' out of it

The drugs all in their system got 'em adamant, they're fine

But in their mind, they know they're not

So they let the substance in their bloodstream

To manipulate endorphins

Cut off the pen, like morphine, but this just creates more fiends

Enjoy yourself, but don't escape in a substance

Dealin' with your problems head-on brings rewards in abundance

So whoever feel they imperil, I'm rockin' with you, like Garrell

Whenever you fall down, try gun, like Meryl, oh, yeah, yeah

It's too deep now, I think it's too deep now

I know you shallow listeners probably tappin' out 'fore you drown

Peep the sound, hold it down, I think the message over now

Let's bring it back to that old rap shit and start it all over now

My residency in the game is permanent, I'll never move out

Even though you doubt, never make a move for clout

Been real, since I moved through the canals

Spit so hard and knock a tooth out

When I did a show with Eminem in Hawaii

I brought the whole fuckin' crew and through a loo out

I might do MSG again, just to bring the woo out

They say your life is a movie, we finna roll the credits on you

Cart of medics on you, sicker than the dogs

I'm 'bout to stick up on you, rigamortus all up on you

Fuckin' around with the boy, in a ditch, where you finna be stayin'

You was sprayin', now you layin' in the ground

I'm comin' down, just to tell you that I told you so

No, I never sold you drugs, but I sold you dope

Suffer from anxiety, through these lyrics, I cope

Savin' society through lyrics I wrote, what's up?

Been grindin' to get my son's trust up

Only thing stuck up is the finger in the middle

My lyrics profound, they lingerin' on the riddle

Fuck all the little shit

I'm over and out, get rid of it, don't want any bit of it

My last album, I know you bit a bit of it

My shit is dope, now take a hit of it

You'd probably benefit from bein' in the fuckin' thick of it

Flame on wax, like the wick is lit, bitch, the heat it on, like Vietnam

Got your life flashin' before your eyes, now you see your mom

First day of school, fast forward, now you wasted at prom

Fast forward, now shit is morbid, you dyin' of omicron

Personally, I hate, that's a Futurama rhyme

Want the dick and I'ma bend her, if she ugly, I return and send her

I pull strings, like Fender, push buttons like the Fender, yo, yo

Back—, back—, back—, back—, racks on racks on racks

I'm runnin' it back, I come for the stack

I'm gettin' this money, like James Yancey

If I don't get the bread, I get ancy

Pullin' triggers, like Tom Pancy, record label better advance me

They can't stand me, 'cause I see what they can't see

My vision go over their head, like Klu Klux Klan sheets

I love the energy whenever me and my fans meet

Jump on the beat and nobody ever handed me defeat

Lyrics, they never deplete, I get green, like cleats

Please don't test my reach, talk shit, drink bleach

Alphabet, like a leech, peep the speech

Presidential suites, I can not be impeached, I never miss



Born to die young

To die of an overdose

To die of a gunshot wound

Or die of loneliness

This is the fate of so many born into party

To make it out of your hood isn't about sporting chains

And making millions of dollars

It's about making a difference

It's about making the right decisions

And in turn breathing life into a community riddled with death"

But I don't think you understand the definition of a hypeman

What you mean?

What I mean is—, look

It's the hypeman's job to alleviate pressure from the main act

You know, so, when I come and I say

""My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my""—

That's when you supposed to come in and say ""Grind""

While I take a breath, okay, so I can rap the next part

Nigga, I know what a hypeman is

No, you obviously don't, 'cause you too hype

You be rappin' the whole verse and shit, on stage, what the fuck?

Man, calm the fuck down, Logic

You too hype right now, it ain't that deep

Man, whatever, man, just let me hit that Jack

Finally found happiness when my wife changed

Used to make all my decisions based off the perception of others

Scared to do anything different, I couldn't get with it

Too worried 'bout others, fuck 'em

Say if you was me, you would do it differently

But you don't got my POV

But I gotta go 'cause I hear the whole crowd screaming my name



Yeah, that's dope, yo



True wealth cannot be measured in gold but in experience, age and everything that comes with it

It's a blessing

So many of us that are chasing our youth

Fixated on the wonderyears

When every moment they have now is wonderful

Family, friends, having children and shifting the perspective of one's entire world in the blink of an eye

This is age

So while you look in the mirror thinking those thoughts

Just remember with every wrinkle and every gray, comes another day that you're alive"

I don't covet everything they got that I don't (Ooh-ooh-ooh)



Let me out of the water

Let me into your sunny day

Let me out, out of the water

Let me into your sunny day

Get me out of this water

Let me into your sunny day

Get me out of this water

Let me into your sunny day

Stop tryna make it right

Gotta get it nice and light

Won't you take me for a ride?

Take me into paradise

Gotta keep our heads tonight

Even if it makes a fight

Take me into paradise

Here I am in paradise"

Come on down
Now Daquan is from South East DC
He says he's willing to sell his soul to make it in the music industry
And today Daquan I believe we can make this a reality
But-but before we make the sa-satanic act of reality

We have to ask

Are you ready for the blood sacrifice?

Are you ready to leave your life of love and holiness behind?



I want the world, I want the money, I want the respect (Nigga, come on down)

I want the gold, I want the chains, I want it, I want it (Nigga, come on down)

Never had nothing but soul, never had nothing but hustle (Nigga, come on down)

Wanna be loved, I wanna be famous, I wanna be rich (Nigga, come on down)

I wanna be anything, wanna be anybody that I'm not (Nigga, come on down)



Let me get it all, get the money, get the women motherfucker better give me like ten of them

Glock 9's I got ten of them

My enemies I gotta get rid of them

Since I was a little boy I wanted to be loved

Wanted to be hugged, but the streets wanted me to thug

Sweep my emotions up under my rug

Then call the plug, to sell me some drugs to sell to my people to smoke on a nub

Sipping liquor by the jug

I'm trying to borrow down these feelings inside of me

Can't speak on the things that done happen to me as a child, I'm talking about sodomy

Oh no I can't let them see that side of me

Therapy that shit right there for them white folk

I sell crack like white yolk

Police they got me walking on a tight rope

Want me on sight 'cause I sell dope

So I'd rather just sell my soul

Getting this money my goal



I want the world, I want the money, I want the respect (Nigga, come on down)

I want the gold, I want the chains, I want it, I want it (Nigga, come on down)

Never had nothing but soul, never had nothing but hustle (Nigga, come on down)

Wanna be loved, I wanna be famous, I wanna be rich (Nigga, come on down)

I wanna be be anything, wanna be anybody that I'm not (Nigga, come on down)



Anyone that I'm not

That I'm not

Anyone that I'm not

That I'm not



Most folks think gangstas like what they do

Think they enjoy killing their own brothers and sisters

By reeling our streets with bullet shells and narcotics

Most people think that shit cool, think again

Why you think they call it the trap playboy?

We just tryna escape by any means

But we mostly end up escaping through death"

Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Yeah, I been tryna drink less
But I feel like when I drink I'm at my best
Not a care in the world, no stress

Always give the world my everything and no less

I wake up seven days a week and get the job done

You know I'm always there for my wife and my son

And at the end of the day, I love to pour one

More like two, but occasionally three and it scares me

Not because I have a problem

I'm the type of person, if there's an issue, then I'ma solve 'em

It's more like seeing how this shit has destroyed life

Uh, I look at my mom, I look at my dad

And see how drugs and alcohol took away everything they had

And it makes me sad, I found the balance, but I feel bad

I didn't drink 'til I was twenty-seven and I did from then

And everytime I take a sip I'm scared that I'll become them

We went to Alcoholics Anonymous mostly twice a week

I was just a little boy that listen when people would speak

Prostitutes, preaches, substitute teachers

Cops and criminals, they all gave speeches

About this addiction and it filled me with conviction

Keep comin' back, boy, it works if you work it

And I did, growin' up, I was a AA kid

I never wanted to make the mistakes that they did

Yeah, sometimes when I sip, you know, I feel survivor's guilt

But I know that what I'm drinkin' could destroy all that I built

So I tread lightly, this shit leaves people dead nightly

Alcoholic bullets in my blood, so I might be

Drug addict bullets in my jeans, so I might be

But I don't use that shit to escape

I deal with my problems head on 'til this day

Addiction to substance, it was my faith, but I broke the cycle



Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa



Ayo, damn

Yo, can we roll the window down, please?

I can—, I can barely see, the fuckin' weed smoke, yo

And I've been practicing my raps and shit
Ayo, I promise I won't never change, I'ma always stay the same
I'ma be me
I'll never change, man, I promise you, I swear
Yeah



I'll never change, I'll never make music for money

You'll never catch me at the VMAs acting funny

Never on the radio on some la-di-da shit

That's the day you know I forfeit

I'ma always be the man I am and never morph it

That's the day you'll know my shit is wack 'cause I forced it

Dropped a track and some energy drink endorsed it

I'ma always be the same person that's cursing on this track



I won't ever change, I promise, I ain't never going back

Yeah

Heh, yeah, you thought, motherfucker

This is what it really is, youngin'



Ayy, why you think I went pop? So my family could eat (Alright)

But now that the fridge is full, it's just a pen and this beat

What you would do if it was 20 mil' or live on the street?

I guarantee your ass is rapping on a radio beat

But it was deeper than that

I used that shit to spread a message that was deeper than rap

Hid the pills in the apple sauce, deep in the trap

Tried to save the world but found out I couldn't do that

But I know I can affect it like a butterfly

Even though I know I can't protect it, deep down wonder why

And that's the reason I went mainstream, if you wonder why

To spread a message of PLP, make it worldwide

And feed my family for generations

So while you hipster motherfuckers is scared of radio stations

You played yourself, congratulations

Had a goal in my head and at 29, I hit it

Multi-million-dollar deals, Logic, yeah, we get it

So focused on the past, don't think you listen when I spit it

That kid back in the basement, he made it, he did it

And now my life is different so I rap 'bout what I know

From the basement to the mansion, there's maturity in the flow

Fuck rap, who gives a shit? I wanna see my son grow

With a fridge full of food, no wonder where the hunger went

Now I don't rap to prove myself, I pick up the pen to vent

But you people stuck in the past, probably take that as content

When your ass should just be happy I'm still giving you content

And to the fans that ain't need me to spell all this shit out

Thank you for riding with me beyond a reasonable doubt

Logic out



Okay, feels good (Logic back)

Here we go



I've been envisioning something different, not insufficient, fuck all the bitchin', I'm on a mission

Like timing, shit is iconic, memories back in the day of the Chronic

In my lungs and in my ears, I wrote this shit with blood and tears

Thought about doing it over the years, 85 finally here

Doing this shit for the art, I'ma give 'em my heart like a high-speed collision

And I give 'em my sight as they all want vision, I'm bleeding, no, wait, I'm bleeding

I feel like rap is retreating while my hairline is receding

Which is literally the definition of what I've become

That's an oldhead, wait a minute, go 'head, I'ma go off

2019 I got wrote off, but I'm bringing it back into focus

I'm God-level, here to locust, I'm so pissed like a P.O.

Rollie gold like C3PO, and I'm busting off like R2

That's COD-level, I'm all through, now fuck you



Our boys have certainly been through a lot today

But they did it, they made it to the show

And to the next chapter of the rest of their lives

Through all the mayhem and adversity

Through all the negativity and hardship

They did it

And here they stand after the show

Radiating a message of peace, love, and positivty

The original RattPack members rejoice

Though deep down, Logic is unsure of something

Not himself or his craft

But something that's been rising to the surface

Something that would take up more space than it should in his mind

Through the next decade



Yo, that shit was crazy

For real bro, we're really on to something

Yo, what's up? Y'all tryna grab a bite to eat or something

Mmm, I can't

That chick I was wrapping up and the bar finna give me a ride

If you know what I mean

Hahaha, you're fucking wild

Yeah, peace

Alright man, alright dawg, I'll see you

I'ma head out too, but I'll see you next weekend at everlasting light

Bet, alright man, I'll see you later

Well, I'ma catch a ride with OB I guess, man, I got finals tomorrow

Yeah?

Yo bro, shit is happening

You getting shit posted on 2DopeBoyz and this song is sick

Doing some real numbers on DatPiff

Look, shit, just a year ago you were homeless

You been sleeping on my couch for like only a year

And now look what's going on

Yeah, yeah, I guess

What's wrong?

Nah, I-, I'm good-

I don't know man, I'm excited and I'm terrified

Of what?

I love rap, you know, it's definitely a foot in the door

But I wanna do other shit too, you know

I don't wanna be on stage at fucking 50 years old

Rapping like the vein on my forehead is gonna explode

With the fucking ""get down with the, hit you with the""

Fucking fuck no, man, like

Dude, I wanna sing, I wanna play guitar, I don't wanna just play it safe

I, I'm just a little scared of what people, like

If I make it in rap, what if people expect that of me?

What if that's the image of, you know

What Logic is or what he isn't? I don't know, I just wanna be able to-

I just wanna be able to do whatever I want

Man, just keep doing what you're doing

Keep spreading that positive message, being positive

The fans are gonna love you, man

And they're gonna love you for putting your heart and soul into this music and making honest music

As long as you keep spreading that positive message, the fans are gonna be with you

It's 2011, who knows where you'll be in ten years?



And now I'm here

Lightyears from where I was before

Mad at the world, ready to leave

I thought I had to be a certain way

I thought I had to act a certain way

Never belonged to begin with

So this is goodbye, this is farewell

To the life I know so well

I'm breaking the chains, I'm ready for change

I've been playing the same old game over and over again

So I stepped away and learned a few things

I thought I hated you 'cause I spoke on things

That you never related to, so here I found myself

It took a lightyear to get past the bullshit

And now I'm right here, unapologetically me

And that's the idea, I wanna do it for free

And never out of fear

I don't wanna try and relive the good years

I don't wanna convince you I'm from the hood, yeah

I don't wanna talk about how good I rap, yeah

I don't wanna perpetuate none of that, yeah, it's all a trap, yeah

It's crazy how some people could hear this and think they know what to say
But they don't know what to say
Nuts
This right here though?
This?

Huh, yeah yeah, there we go

Bars

Yo, that's what I'm fuckin' talkin' about

Yeah, uh



Still in the game with ya

Wettin' fools like when the rain hit ya

Music, movies, and families, I'm a lane switcher

Ready to get ya now

My flow make you rethink your whole fuckin' style

Nick Cannon on these motherfuckers, Bobby goin' wild

As a youngin', as a child, I was dreamin' for this

Fiendin' for this, listen, lean in with this

I'm the definition of a try hard

The lyrical miracle God

Do anything just for thе applause

All up in your face with some shit you can't avoid

Yеah that's black white boy, finna push you into the void

I ain't got nothing but time like I'm Christopher Lloyd

And I ain't got time to diss you

I'd rather dismiss you and sell more records than you did in your first week with a reissue

Claiming you the greatest, but is you?

I do this for Kenny, do this for Cole, do this shit for the GZA and the whole clan, fo' sho'

I do this for Mos', do this for Thought, do this for Dilla on the for real'a

But don't let me start showin' love, cause I won't be able to stop

Made fifty million when I went pop

But everybody know when Logic pick up the mic, bars drop

I respect this generation, but I need the hardest bars you can provide

I'm taxing you with inflation

Bobby Boy in the cut like a mason

I got verses like Freddy, Jason

Fuckin' amazing, yeah



You have to do it again, so people don't think it's a fluke

You have to do it again, one more time, let's go



Yo, you are walking hand-to-hand with a real one

I'm still one

I'm tryna slice open my veins just to feel somethin'

Spill my blood on the page, blood on the leaves

Blood flowing down my arm from the heart on my sleeve

We keep it real all the time, boy you best believe

I love rap and had to leave, meanwhile the media like to perceive

That I was never welcome and these record labels thieves

Sample Tribe Called Quest and have to pay Lou Reed

A hundred percent

Pick up the mic and imma vent

Fuck all that shit



Yo, ay fuck rap, let's dead it

Everything that I could rap about, already said it

I'd rather give you these melodies

Kill the game so many times it's no longer a felony

What the fuck is you telling me, you ain't selling me

Do what you used to do and do it over and over

How 'bout you suck my dick and accept it's over

It's a new chapter, in the country, whippin' a Raptor

The realest I've ever been, it's far from SAG-AFTRA

Really used to give a fuck but now it's just laughter

Happily ever after, prolly not, but I have to have hope

Used to obsess over being dope

But the industry too cut-throat

They less focused on the talent and more focused on the upvotes

One album, I'm the champed, and the next, I'm the villain

Do the thing we like or else it's fuck you and your feelings

I was spread thin, just about ready to let the lead in

Breaking down on stage, that's shit I can't evade

I open up about my feelings, they call me a faggot

Fuck you, I had it, mentality was shattered

Wanna know why I retired? 'Cause I was uninspired

And everything was fuck you, pay me

Speak my mind, they turn around and wanna blame me

Try something different and they say I'm not the same me

You could never tame me

I'd rather fail trying something new than doing the same shit every day

Fuck you (Haha)

It's Logic"

Come back, run it back, neutralize 'em like Men in Black

From stone's throw to Madlib invasion

Ask any fan on the street, they'll say your shit is amazing

The G.O.A.T., a legend, a god amongst men

Greatest producer alive, number one out of the ten

Egon would say that shit'll prolly make you feel uncomfortable, don't it?

But it might bring you back, won't it?

Quas and an MPC is no match for any opponent

One of the greatest alive, nobody could argue

Just come back man, the rap cats would never dog you

I had to write you now or else I prolly never would

I don't want you full of regret like, ""damn man, I shoulda""

I don't think you understand what you instilled in me

Lookin' for land, feelin' down as a man

Prayin' up to God, lookin' down at me, man

Thinkin' of all of the songs I never sonned

That's the day I died while you're fillin' up my lungs

In another life I was a killer

Psychopathic, schizophrenic population filler

Livin' in the background, livin' in the shadows

Waitin' for the rest of the world to decompose

'Til I put a bullet in my head

Now the life that I live is as a sinner

Just a human being, a professional beginner

I was never a winner but I won some

Ayo, last album on DefJam, now where the fucks at?

Independent now, smear they face in my nutsack

College Park next, bitch I saved it for the fans

I've been grindin' since before I could afford a pair of Vans

Recorded this album before they gave me my advance

Sign with another major, nah, no chance

It's like Chicago with no Chance, not a chance

This beat that you'rе hearing is a primary example

Of somе shit you can accomplish not worrying 'bout a sample

I had to clear it, now again hearing spirit

Hit the homie Egon, he send a hundred vinyls

Fuck mixing an album, two track that's the final

Bobby Campbell and Jerry prolly smoking the ounces

Some shit I can't even pronounce

That's my homies, that's my engineers

Many platinum plaques made over the years and many more to come

I feel it in my blood, Paul Dano

Feel it in my bald spot, Anthony Fantano

You plaid-shirt-wearing-motherfucker

Ayo, ayo



I used to hate you cause you shit on my music

But now we homies, I take your criticism and use it

I used to fantasize about murdering you

Choking you to death and watching from your point of view 'till we got friendly

And I realized you wasn't never tryna end me

One night, midnight

2020 on the phone

You said the wildest shit that solidified me to stone

You said, you said I built an amazing fanbase and career

I'm successful and I'm fuckin' worthy to be here

In your opinion, it's just your opinion

It doesn't matter like your lesion of fuckboy minions

It meant a lot, friend or not

Honesty is everything, it's fuckin' everything

I remember 2 Dope Boyz and Fake Shore Drive

I remember performing before this virus was alive

I remember commenting on rap Genius threads

I remember arguing over the Hip Hop Heads

Way before I was famous and criticized

I was just a member of the community in they eyes

And the craziest shit, I'm still the same kid I was

They lift me up like that bomb weed

In this pound never found seeds

Busy playin', but still make time for blazin' shit

G4 to be exact, rewards it be to raps

Three hoes before a foreign and three more are bein' cracked (Facts)

And we unpacked, I wasn't really needin' that

I was needin' validation, which, I agree is whack

Here's the kicker though, my therapist is me (Facts)

Complainin' 'bout my problems, how American of me

There's a scarcity of free thinkers (Yeah)

It's all group thoughts (Sheep)

You ain't mad at me, you mad your lady love it, we should change the subject (Uh-huh)

Long hair lookin' like I'm supposed to be on Game of Thrones, HBO

But every time I talk, it makes the news like the Daily Show

I'm wavy so, of course you wanna cruise, I call her Katie Holmes

All my dreams are comin' true, that's somethin' I innately know

Labels feedin' artists [?] like palio

Meanwhile I'm feedin' myself

Had a nightmare last night that I was sleep with myself, yeah, yeah

Oh God



I keep my ego in check, just me and this instrumental pumpin' through this cassette deck

Money don't represent my rank

Yeah, logic rose from Jack but even the Titanic sank

I seen cats with egos bigger than cruise ships lose it

Gain power and abuse it

Same to take my kindness for weakness and confuse it

Same type don't know I stay with the gat and know how to use it

Used to be addicted to likes by the likes of people I ain't even liked

Anxiety, readin' comments ain't have me readin' right

Trapped in the Matrix, Black Neo, back to the basics

Now everything I do is off the grid, they just can' trace it

Face it, I used to love rap, now all I love is my family, fuck the fake shit

Only engulphed in darkness, can you see the light like common sense

But to my defense, that way you're thinkin' past tense

Life's a bitch and shit can get screwed like when you camping, that's fuckin' in tents

On tour the fans screamin' the West like cravin'

You know I deal with shit that'll make the average man's chest cave in

On the scene daily, this just in, word to Hailey

I write about the world around me like a journalist

It's funny how people that don't listen to me concerned with this

It's 'cause they have to be, these motherfuckers weaker than muscle atrophy

This life feels like a simulation, man, it has to be

Walked through the world, the whole shit is just one giant catastrophe

Speak on mental health, the people after me, that's why I tapped out

Retired 'cause I felt rapped out

Feel like people more connected with shit that's not what raps about, so I mapped out

Just me and my fam, I don't give a damn

Livin' day to day, just like the normal man I am

Bringin' it back to the reason I began it from the start

Spillin' syllables at will at the open mic, after dark

Hangin' with cats that stay with iron like they Tony Stark

We recognize when the phonies talk, why?

Real G's fly in silence like gnats, G7 raps

Retired now I'm back, I relapsed, we bringin' that heat back

Like July, that real shit, no two ply

Bitches I've been plottin' and plannin', fuck whatever they been demanding

I grab the cannon, and ran in the lyrical phantom, jumpin' out the plane tandem

Flow so effortless it seems like it happens at random

My greed expand bigger, I Bruce Banner 'em

I hit you with the buckshot then the Chapelle slug

Hustle music like some of my brothers still hustle drugs

I'm the unsung, did it for money, made the money, now I do it for fun

Music will forever be a part of me

I do this from the heart, from the circumflex artery

My bank account is seven digits like I won the lottery

But that don't navigate the way I shape the game like pottery

So hold up, grab the gat, reload, the Rattpack be my soldiers

Yeah, I'm older but I be wiser

Fucking around, now open your eyes up

Now these haters claim I fell from grace a couple years back

Still at the top, where I been at

Eight miles from the surface of Earth, feeling infinite

Don't gotta get into that

Who's the illest on a track? Rewind it now and listen back

Wanna know who the best is? I give you fourty-four guesses

It doesn't matter and it never did, it never does, it never will

That's why I retired, it's impossible to fulfill

Just a hamster wheel, full of cats that never still

So let's just say Logic served him up a queens gambit



Egon got the La tasse in the cellar

My rhymes affect the game, Mandela

Vinyl Days kinda like the days of Roc-A-Fella

Yeah, I'm on the beat, but you know I'll murder a-capella

I stepped in Def Jam building the other day

I ain't ask for fifty million like I was Ye

I shot the video for Tetris in the hallway

In the CEO office, boy, I'm talkin' Jay

Feet all on the couch like I'm Rick James

Skyline of the city through the window pane

And spit the verse on the air conditioner

Listen up, dishin' up food for thought

In rare condition, peep the diction

Pen bleed all over the pulp, no fiction

My description of how I write lyrics is off the wall, no Egyptian Flowin' in code, peep the encryption

Ayo, ayo, my rolodex shine brighter than my Rolex

Trust my gut 'cause I know best, people think that I know less

But that's 'cause I never talk, all I ever do is walk in

Like Christopher Wallace, my shit flawless

Come with the rawless like Nobu

Y'all don't want the beef, niggas tofu

All of 'em was prayin' I was stayin' retired, y'all too hopeful

I got a notebook full of more bars than Bourbon Street

Word to Curren$y, peep the urgency

Logic bringin' boom-bap back, this shit is the resurgency

Can't fuck with that mumble-schmuble shit, it fuckin' burdens me



Ayo, ten years driven in the game with the brights on

Ten years, I murdered your ears when the mic's on

Ten years, hit after hit, I got the sights on

Ten years on Def Jam, I kept the lights on, boy



I ain't a hoodlum, they ain't arrest or murder me yet

Why ain't I Muslim? Jay Elec' ain't converted me yet

The chain immaculate, the plaque good and the same as the juvie

The pain is practiced, just sit back 'cause this shit came with a groupie

The stainless MAC can't clip attachment, fit the frame of this Uzi

Just can't imagine it in the act of shit to drain this jacuzzi

This ain't no actin', reenact the scripts, this ain't a real movie

This ain't no rapper switchin' to activist, this danger feel newby

Hold up, diamonds got me seasick, pursuin' dreams

Tryin' to stop the street shit, exhuming kings

Imagine drinkin' three-fifths to a human being

Because a human being deemed me three-fifths of human being

How much chillin', dope, and dough I done mentioned?

Bros I convinced to go out on lynches

Even sister Kamala, Joe Biden henchman

Even niggas T'Challa, Josiah, or Henson

Sucks to who ever the fuck that loves you

This could get uglier than a Funk Flex love boot

Always coppin' fly shit, Adidas Reeboks

On all they top five lists, just probably not B. Dott's



Woah

This is what happens when an unmovable object

Meets an unstoppable force

Like two freight trains goin' head to head in a collision

Unstoppable, unbeatable, unbreakable

They're goin' at it, head to head, toe to toe

This is the most gangsta shit I've ever seen

Logic and GZA, this is an unparalleled match"

Let it spin around and see the room (Funkmaster Flex)
We should literally put that shit right here and just let it spin
Around the room, you know what I mean?
But, anyways



Yo, I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk

I'm that motherfucker Tarantino, Dawn Till Dusk

Hit the homie Mac Demarco, like ""What up, my man?""

I need some raw shit and he recommended the tuscan

I'm talkin' hip-hop shit straight to tape

He did the Salad Days demos on it and it sounded great

Any real musician listenin' can rеlate

I feel like the RZA rеcording in '88

Prince Rakim, I fuckin' blow like Herashim'

I'm on the scene, never flippin' scripts like a pharmacist

I am quite the opposite, talk shit, get hit quick

Give a fuck what you talkin' 'bout, y'all can suck my dick

This that DOOM shit, J. Dilla, Madlib, MadGic comin' soon, shit

I get the pussy wetter than her masseuse hit, y'all

Ayo, ayo, y'all play games, more cap, I don't cap

I do this for the love of hip-hop, I don't rap

Open up your chest like the immense slide

Who the best? Don't give a fuck but don't test my mic

It's Logic



Haha, ayo-yo, I rips it hardcore like porno flick bitches

Passin' like turntables, beatbox and floppy biscuits

A young Tom movin' with me and it's risky business

I delivered more gangsta to game than Father Christmas is

Like a yellow jacket, teens with those little ratches

Spin your head back like you taste scratch up out the scratches

Smack defamer, the rappers say what brings, decapitate you

Leave your cow stain like Gerico activator

Sold blow, sold drank, voice blow like cold drink

Boomerang it back to the track, push your hair back

You need more than Rogaine, no pain, no game

Like Patti LaBelle say, but me and Logic, no thing

Vinyl Days, Vinyl Days leave your mind astray

Even with application maps, they can't find a way

Blah, the pure hip-hop tracks, Marty Mall, Biz Markie

BDP, Eric B., Kool G Rap, and Large B, please, ha"

Press the demo and pass it person to person, yeah it's on

Watch it spread like Omicron, bringin' the doom like Victor Vaughn

Smash your nuts, just your nuts on a dresser like Raekwon

Doin' it for the culture, Cs up as this lyricism assault you

Like a Glock blast, in my own lane, smashin' the gas

You furious, I'm too fast like Ludacris, bitch

Sippin' Sandeni in a village of Greenwich

I'm in it and feel it, infinite with it, if you want it, then come and get it

Steady in the gym, nothin' but curls like I'm Hasidic

Too sick with it, since back when my cap was fitted

But nowadays, you know I'm snappin', motherfucker

The Game told me we was just some rappin' motherfuckers

Word to Compton, all the way to Gaithersburg, my stompin'

Legends love Logic, peep my features alone (Y— y— yeah)

Haters talk shit, fans is like ""Leave him alone""

Don't worry, RattPack, I ain't worried 'bout that

I'd rather be loved by legends with careers that really last

Than accepted by some weirdo on YouTube with a podcast

Retired, now I'm back, no fucks, havin' a blast

Tell me, what do you do when you sold out The Garden?

What do you do with the audience you brought in?

What do you do when you made all the money?

Pass the baton and let the next one take it from me

Found a strong black woman from the land of Nigeria

The way she flows, these MCs know that they inferior

Helpin' other musicians is my criteria

Now let me pass the mic to Nezi, show 'em something serious



Well, it's the lyrically homicidal, vital

Spittin' for your idol, vital

For the Gs, ain't somebody hot as me, prodigy

Probably be on your favorite rapper in another three

Honestly, my articulation's an anomaly

Audibly switchin' these flows like clothes

Get big dough, when I rip these ho's

Watch the way I do's this, murder on acoustics

Run for your gun 'cause I'm waxed, I be ruthless

N-E-Z-I, triple D, I stay up on the chrome, 24s like T.I

Soldier in my city like a motherfuckin' G.I

My niggas got a whole lotta money like BIA, bitch

Quick with the game, one hitter spitter is my fuckin' nickname

A ship that can't rip is my other diss dame

So don't ask me if I write, 'cause my pen is insane

This a lunch-in, I don't gotta punch in

If I clock a hater, they can meet me in the dungeon

I be with the ghouls, told you, I'm a fool

Bobby ain't the only rapper runnin' with the tool

I'm cruel if I reach you, I ain't gotta beat you, I'll eat you

Big bitch spittin' in my name, that's Zepha

Pass me the reefer, y'all gettin' smoked

And if I'm not the illest, who you feelin' is jokes, huh

Family is the only thing that mattеrs, bitch, I'm Stefan

I can't believе at first sight you thought I was Steve

Bitch, I'll orphan you

Shapeshift and morph into your mom

Slit your throat and make it look like she's the one that committed the crime

You know I'm too committed to rhyme since my first show in Chicago

Never throwin' shade, we keepin' it light like vitiligo

Chain around my neck glisten like El Dorado

Can't fuck bitches with baggage, you married a ho with cargo

Bitches be jumpin' ship word to Argo

If you don't understand that line, no need for an apology

You stupid motherfucker, I'm referencin' Greek mythology

I never went to college, B

And made millions while you pissed like you majored in urology

So high up that it's down

Wow, y'all done bit the whole style

Wow, I don't trip, I just smile

Murderous shit, I fit the profile

Murder was the case, had that shit on sight

Play this in the whip, man, that shit gon' crank

You steady talkin' shit like your shit don't stank (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

News flash, buddy, we the shit, move right



From irrelevant back to relevant in a matter of seconds

Tired of misconceptions

Misdirected, inheaded in my direction

Intelligent and I'm tellin' it

Droppin' heavy shit that's still heaven sent

The freshest prince

Utmost, definite, deadin' it

'Fore niggas can't fathom who they effin' with

Raw, no condom, you still can't come correct with it

I represent a specialist of artist who never charted but never parted

Often regarded as the hardest, as the autumn falls in 'til the wind

I never fail, leaves do emcees too but the pros propel, don't tell

Another cup of XXL, trouble for sale

Back bustin' a couple of shells, for Durell

Logic asked me ""What the deal?""

Back then it was a film per album, plus a couple mill'

Plug pulled the rug from up under my wheels

Humbly kill, stomach and pills, fumblin' bills shit

Killed the player like Jada did Will Smith

For tryna play the same game, nigga, you will quit

I still spit, like it's foot on my throat, 'til I'm a ghost

Still not a G.O.A.T. but I feel like the G.O.A.T

From straight with ten Gs to racin' Bentleys

Cool from the junk to lacin' Jet Li

Convince me, who cooler out in Aruba?

Blowin' ounces with Buddha, I know the rouse the manoeuvre

Pursue or let's speak about it, I keep a stylist from here to Falice

To fornicatin' at Caesar's palace, balance both feet on the concrete

Calmin' me, throw that heater in my own reach

From Palms Beach to the pretty sands in the Turks

Guns drum, where the loot at?

Bezerk on the beat, machine work

Motherfucker got ten milli', that's cute, you ain't in my network

Literally, no way you could ever get rid of me

'Cause I started from the bottom, the basement, the fuckin' garbage

Now I'm on top and you talkin' shit, hell, nah, bitch

You mad that I'm rich, you mad that I made it

I rub it in your face and paint it in your blood just to illustrate it

Leave these pussies castrated and faces exacerbated

Spend all day talkin' about me, you fascinated

I rip your intestines out of your abdomen through your asshole

And choke you with 'em, I'm sicker than Venom

I'll murder you like OGs in prison do to child molesters and rapists of women

I'ma be the shark that grew legs and evolved from swimmin'

You know I started from the bottom, flows, I got 'em

Bars, I got 'em, yeah, you know I fuckin' got 'em

Leave you stutterin' to g-g-get shit out like Joe Biden

Ridin' in the whip with the homies on some m.A.A.d city shit

All I need is one mic, one pen, one page to ignite

Subject matter heavy but the flow is MC Lyte

You mad as fuck, all you see is red like a conservative

All the critics do is talk, I'm really not concerned with it

Hella tired and we can make your residency permanent

Several shots, they tyin' up your body with a tourniquet

Let it rock, it's obvious that he don't know who turn it is

Keep my circle tight-knit 'cause people move deceitful

Money and greed will expose you to the root of evil

Already proved myself, not worried 'bout who's my equal

Far from an anti-vaxxer but I moved the needle

She got me wonderin' if what I do is legal

Fuck it, I'm goin' a hunnid in this Buick Regal

Fuck it, I'm goin' a hunnid playin' Beanie Sigel

You still run that old game, like a Neo Geo

You lookin' for me? I'ma be in Rio

Sunbathin' off the coast, sippin' Pinot Grigio

Out the country so much they like, ""Easy, gringo""

Straight off the two-track, don't need a single

Travelled abroad for my catalog

Made all this money recording raps on my Macintosh, call it Apple sauce

Even with the cameras off, I be spazzin', dawg

Drum machine, analog, the North Face camouflage

That lo-fi dusty, Panasonic with the trackin' off

Marijuana smoke fill the air like L.A. traffic smog

Come on, homie, listen to the voice of reason

Yeah, you talk a lot of shit but don't want the beef like a vegan

Was passin' through like the aux channel

And then I fell asleep on you, shit, we call you the golf channel

I'm barbecue grillin' these rappers in Croc sandals

Got money to cop Lambos but I'd rather chop samples

Many lines, many rhymes, shit, gutter like Pennywise

Shoutout Big Brother, got many eyes

I'm like Malcolm peekin' through the mini-blinds

Fuckin' with Logic, that's the reason that you stop breathing

Cardiac arrest caught you at your chest

Should've wore a vest, now you all a mess

You no kind of threat, you should've wore a dress

Polo high-tech with the navy crest

Cut from the cloth you couldn't thread with a needle

Bought the shit at Fred Segal, got your bitch spread eagle

The revolution won't be televised, they tellin' lies

They wanna strip your soul away and lead you to a world that's dry

That's why we in the kitchen cookin', know you smell the vibes

And stick to your ribs shit, no frozen fries, go against the gang, get pulverized

I'm at the crib watch-watchin' Cobra Kai, thinkin' to myself, ""God damn, how old am I?""

Rose through depression like a rose, I was destined

Your boy reach his goals like D-Rose with the left hand

When life takes a toll, I suppose it's a lesson

Question, how you woke but you slept in?

Treadin' on your rappers like Midas for over ten years

Without changin' tires, shit, I should probably check the mileage

Back on my hustle, got packs in the duffle

Push rhymes like weight, yeah, you know I'm taxin' you double

I'm in a pocket like I'm runnin' that, run it back

I bought your new shit, hey, run me my money back

Fly by night, this that flight like Mike

ESPN better get those highlights right

Perform better when the lights shine bright

You lookin' like food, it might get fried like rice

Throw on a chef apron and I turn into Gordon Ramsay

I seen cats sell they whole soul for a Camry

I seen your favorite artists do the most just for Grammys

I seen a grown man lyin' just to get to panties

I'm cookin' like grannies, the recipe is sick and we got extras in the pantry

I'm goin' Super Saiyan, just to represent the family

I think that's why the haters can't stand me

I'm not the socialite type, but my vocals quite right

I'm still spittin' raps like it's Open Mic night

I'm still gettin' played from the hoes you might like

I'm still gettin' paid off the flows you probably bite

That was just the lifestyle, no way you could combat it

I think I'm rappin' like I don't give a fuck 'cause I don't

Got a million platinum plaques and billions in streams

I used to think this shit was the definition of dreams

Now I understand that none of that is what it seems

It won't fulfill you, but it'll fill you full up off emptiness

Mike, Mike Caren over at Atlantic, he offered me a deal for thirty grand

I was like ""Fuck no"", hahaha

Shoutout Mike, though

Some independent label offered us one-point-five, and we was like ""Nah""

But Def Jam hit me up, you know what I'm saying?

Noah pressed my A&R for ten fucking years, bro

He linked me with No I.D., man, and I was like, ""Yo, No I.D.?

That's Ye, that's Jay, that's Common, homie - how could we not?""

Remy, Carolyn, Yolanda, Nadeen

And of course, of course

Deborah at the sample team, I fuckin' love you, Deborah

I don't even gotta say your full name, you are a goddess

Nicole Pastine (And of course the homie Xavier)

Rappin' is my passion, I love y'all, man, look

This what I'ma say about Def Jam, look, man

We had some ups and downs, you know what I'm saying?

My first album, I was gettin' sued by some fuckboy

And y'all was tryna get me to change my name and shit

I spent my whole fuckin' career, this who I was

Y'all tryna get me to change my name

Y'all wasn't tryna put out my album so we did the ""While You Wait"" shit

We went on tour, you know what I'm saying?

But eventually, shit worked out

But even with that, you motherfuckers

You know, you under shipped me and shit

And that's what I'll say

I don't, I really wholeheartedly don't believe that was none of the people I just named either, man

Everybody, I fuck with y'all, I rock with y'all

Any other fuckboys behind the scenes, y'all could suck a dick

Eat my whole fuckin' ballsack, man

This industry is fucked up

The wildest shit, is I'ma say this, man

This whole industry is musical chairs, yo

Cats like Steve Bartels, Faisel, Jeff Harleston, man

They, they the real ones, you know what I mean?

But like motherfuckers be so in-and-out, that's why I didn't stay with Def Jam

I went to Def Jam after ten years on the label, because I owed them that

I was like, ""Okay, so what's up? We signing another deal?""

They ain't even get back to me in time

So I went somewhere else and I don't know who butthurt or what

I could give a fuck, man

All I'ma say is I love y'all who rock with me

I love y'all who take care of me

I love y'all who fuckin' drove me from New York to Boston to do

Radio interviews and shit man

Appreciate y'all

It's been a, it's been a dope time on this major label shit, you know what I'm saying?

I've made millions and millions and millions of dollars for y'all, hahaha

And uhh, we've had some good memories

I love you, I appreciate you

My only regret is I ain't get to really fuck with Tunji like that

We doin' this last album, you know what I'm sayin'?

But Tunji, man, that's the God, he's here for the culture

Yo man, you're a fuckin' G bro

Much love to Lucian

I appreciate all the fuckin' millions of dollars that you gave me to make these records, hahaha

Logic as a rapper is an anomaly, a person who is out of time

Living in the present, you know, rooted in the past

But a traditionalist who believes in the future

Who believes in what hip-hop was and can still be

So we're here in this modern time

Thinking about and listening to the development of hip-hop and it's future all at once

I think that a lot of people in the modern sense of the word get caught up in how fleeting time is

And they believe that what's happening right in front of them

Is the most immediate thing and it's the most meaningful thing

And they have to engage what's happening in the moment

Because the moment's gonna be gone and then they're not gonna care

Or no one else around them is gonna care

And I think we forget that great experiences in the, in humanity

Go on for decades, centuries, sometimes millennia

Before anybody even really knows how to make sense of them

And so, in the same way that the monks in the dark ages were keeping records and saving books

You know, it is important for us to really make sense of one of Americas great folk musics, and that's hip-hop

And there's very few people who care enough to actually keep the form going while trying to push it forwards

Logic's one of those dudes

And the reason Madlib and I decided that we wanted to work with him

Is because he came through with a true sincerity and appreciation for the form

And for all of the people who make it

And like a true understanding of craft and like, who's doing what

And how their technique is either important, relevant

Something that needs to be preserved or not

And I remind myself that even though hip-hop seems to me

In my mid forties to be an old thing because it's been around since the early '70s

It's actually just in its infancy

And if it's not for people like Logic trying to keep this tradition alive

We're not really gonna know even shortly after, what's supposed to come

This hopefully is an art form that's gonna outlast

All these art forms that preceded it and formed it

And we're only gonna know that if people who truly have the passion, belief

And the proficiency, the musical acumen

To hold the form, hold it dear

And at the same time, not be so reverent to it and push it forward

Are there to show us the way

So hopefully he's one of these dudes, I have that belief"

I know sometimes this world reminds us we should take it slow

And the demons we battle with make it harder to cope

Why you think we get addicted to alcohol and dope?

Addiction's like a mud bath without a bar of soap

In other words it's impossible to stay clean

For people like us bein' happy is just a daydream but

Beyond drugs, it's even day to day shit

Constantly comparin' yourself to others and they shit

But they want what they want how they want it and that shit just drains you

So I persevere and I face the fear

Even when they discredit my career

But on the inside

Oh, on the inside

I should have stuck to the rivers and the lakes I was used to

'Cause now it's waterfalls

What they tell us? To live more realistically (Ayy)

Fuck that, get the fuck back, fuck rap and all that noise

Growing up, how I grew up I really never had a choice

Had killers and murderers in my house and they was all of my boys

But deep down I always knew better, knew that shit I need to avoid



Ayy, ayo

I got a lot on my mind

Got a lot of work ahead of me

I'm tryna maintain balance of my time

Never want to let it bottle up like everything fine

That's how you go crazy and end up in the pond

Rhymes I've been writin' so hot you would think it was in Arabic

Flow bomb like a terrorist, never careless

Alright, well I guess I just I woke up one day and I was like ""You know what? I kinda feel like rapping again."" You know what I'm saying? So I did. And I been chillin' with little Bobby and his fine ass momma and we out here in the country. Shooting guns, riding dirt bikes and shit and I was just like ""Man, I want to do this."" So I invited all the homies in the middle of nowhere. And uhh we just decided to do this Bobby Tarantino EP, three-peat, off the cuff just for fun, just for the summer, just for all the homies. But we actually out here recording this album. It's going to be my last studio-album on DefJam. So it's going to be a vibe. It's just going to be fun, you know, just a fun thing. You know me, I'm a nerd, I love hip-hop, man. I love you listening, I love the fans, we doing this shit for the fans man. Whole time I was gone they was like ""Come back!

My word is bond, we had somethin' going on

I played all the parties and sang the la-di-da-dis

I've picked up the mic and serenaded the hotties

I drove the Impalas with cats that's had bodies

I hit the studio, you know I left the track bodied

I do this shit right here for me, myself and nobody

Me and my family rollin' deep like Gotti

Word to John, oh, you know we got it going on

I'm a silver tongue motherfucker but it never gone

It goes on and on and on and on and on

In the studio 'til like five in the mornin'

Rappin 'til the sun comes up and it's the dawn

While my homies smokin' more grass than acres on my lawn

Put on your good clothes, it's showtime at the Apollo

Shut the fuck up and get to the point like a hollow

I need the microphone like thirsty bitches need the follow

I get the pussy wetter than mahalo-halo, ho!

It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone

When I was twenty-one



It was all a dream just a year ago

Bussin' tables and servin' food but y'all don't hear it though

Now I'm on another level but y'all aren't near it though

My soul bleedin' on the track, so spiritual

It's a blessing cause now rappin' is my profession yo

Set to detonate, I'm just waitin' for my time to blow

White boy at first glance but when I rhyme they know

Race don't mean a fucking thing the second that I flow

It's been a year and everything I said would happen has

While everybody that I know was out havin' a blast

I was right here in the studio bustin' my ass

It's been a year, I'm twenty-one but I feel (Thirty-five)

Yeah, and now I got this

I taste the blood, no one can stop this

Second I drop this, die hard fans is finna cop this

While the rest of the world follows through fiber optics

I took my time, see I studied the game, learned how to rhyme

I was around drugs and gats, but never delved in crime

Had other things in mind, so I began to grind

First tape was a success

Locally, I got press

But I knew this one right here would run the world a mess, but I digress

A year ago, I was a youngin in his room

Staring out the window, lookin' at the moon, knowing it's coming soon

But today I board this rocket ship and sonic boom

Cause I am no longer a seed, homie, it's time to bloom"

Fuck yo money, fuck yo jewelry, fuck yo cars
Fuck all yo bitches that you got

All that shit ain't fresh no more, fuck all that



(Verse 1)

On the real homie, on the real

Tell me how you feel

Everything I spit is gold like I got a grill

Bet you people talking thought I'd sell out once I got a deal

Still me and my team, only difference - we live in the hills

We living a dream, these bitches perpetrating the skills

At the soup kitchen with my mama they giving us meals

I was poor in my adolescence but now I'm getting meals

Come on, tell me how it feels when that brand new record spills

Homie this the come up

I'm from where them drug dealers will run up

But I was never bout that shit, I just worked till the sun up

Oh yeah

Claiming that they got it over there

But they never had it over there

Homie this the come up

Came a long way, this the come up

Been a long time coming, it's the come up

Been a long damn time, it's the come up



(Verse 2)

Open your mind, this is work ethic

Ninety-nine percent of you couldn't comprehend the method

Cause you too wrapped up in the money and bitches

I get riches but never sacrifice the art

Been real from the start, now break it down

That super-duper-killer flow

All these bitches in here make you wanna kill a ho

It's kind of funny how the flow make me sound ignant

But you know the wordplay on another level, isn't it?

I been at it since a young'n on a dolo

Till I got a team and sat by the door in a solo

Bad bitches wanna fuck me on the low though

Tryna' break the ice she like, ""Can I get a photo?""

A long time comin', what you call that?

Shorty blowin' up my phone, I promise to call back

Unless you a crazy ass bitch

Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Yeah, alright, yo—

Couple days ago, I met the illest latina

Her demeanor was unexplainable, you shoulda seen her

Thick thighs, nice ass

Body like an hourglass

Didn’t hesitate to break a brother neck

Second, she passed I was like, “What’s up?”

To which she replied, “How you doin’?”

I said, ""De nada momma but your beauty I’m pursuin’

And I said ""I’m about to win the lottery""

She asks “How?”

I said, “Your seven digits right now” and made her smile

Now we conversing and she feelin’ my style

I can tell by the way she talkin’

That she down to go the mile

Had a couple drinks, now we headed back to her place

The shade of red from her lipstick all over my face

I’m tryin’ to hit it, split it

Baby girl you gonna let me get it?

She said, “Hold up ok, I don’t get down like that”

I said I know beautiful girl

But I get down like that

So let me heat it up, heat it up

Go crazy and beat it up

“Damn Papi, how you even know I like it rough?”

The way you was feelin’ on me

When kissing revealed enough

I wanna scratch you, provoke you

Bite you, choke you

But just a little, bite your legs

Dig up in the middle

“Hold up, wait a second

Nigga, you gotta condom?”

Come on beautiful girl, of course, I’ve got protection

I stay with Magnums and I ain’t talkin’ Smith and Wesson

I keep undressin’

Girl I’m about to teach you a lesson

After I hit it she says

“Bobby I have a confession, I think I love you!”

I said ""What the fuck?”

Thinkin’ to myself, ""Damn, I shoulda never cuff""

Kissed her on the cheek

Hit the lights, then she fell asleep

So I snuck out the bathroom window on the creep, like



Relax yourself girl, please settle down

Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

(The next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, yo

The next day, the next day, the next-)



Yeah, yeah, yo

Now I’m out the door

Downtown is where I’m about to go

Got a meeting with my boy Chris about a dope show

So I hail a cab, jump in, but so does some girl

Beautiful, pretty eyes with luxurious curls

I said, “No fair”

She smiled and said, “Why don’t we share?”

What a success, lookin’ at her chest

Thinkin’ if her breasts was a test, she would fail

Fresh tip nails

Type of ass make a brother train of thought derail

As we converse, I could tell that she feelin’ my style

Get the pussy wet, that’s the mission

As long as she listen to my words

Feelin’ on the curves

Only lips I’m thinkin’ bout kissin’ is hers

I can barely fight the urge

Only thing that matter right now

Is these two verbs

I’m talkin’ me and you

So fine, I’d think I’d start seeing you

Her body was a work of art like Hieroglyphics

Too much detail to go into specifics

Now I’m diggin’ shorty

Like an archeologist tryin’ a bone

Searchin’ for a queen to take the throne

The type of girl to love

And call her my own

I’m just a bachelor (bachelor)

Looking for a bachelorette

Baby, maybe you can persuade me

To give you love you couldn’t imagine yet

Kiss you on the neck then I sedate the pussy like a vet

Got the shorty rollin’ like a movie set

Take her to the Rio

I’m not talking about G-burg

I’m talking De Janeiro, spend dinero like its reverb

Expansion

Couple kids runnin' round the mansion

Day dreamin’, getting ahead of my self

Advancin’, but, come on, girl

Now come and give me love

I know we just met but romance is like a drug

You know we go together

Like sympathy and hugs

So I write this girl a symphony

And tell her that I love her everything



Girl, I love your everything

You know I love your everything

I said I love your everything

Yeah, love your everything

Say it then I do it

Now better grab your jacket

Greatest of all time, I want the world addressing me

At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me

I'm trynna stay focused, I guess that the lord testing me

I knew as a child, that this was my destiny

They do it for the limelight

But I make sure my rhyme's right

Waiting till the time's right

Smiling at my mom's life

Smiling at my mom

Smiling at my momma

Made up what we sippin' now

We was never trippin' now

We on private jets, in other words, that means that we trippin' now

Cause they was over there, I was over here

They was too scared while I was facing my fears

I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer

And the whips with the rims still spinnin'

Shooting for the stars

And I ain't finna land

Givin' everything I can

While they tell me I'm the man

Making music is the plan

Matter fact, you can call it plan B

And I be first to pop off, infantry

Gotta keep em in line like symmetry

We all fam same root smoke a different tree

And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony

I love it when they cheer

Will I make it? I don't know
From the bottom of my heart I swear to God I gotta blow
This for every time the world told me no
If I don't make it in this game I ain't got nowhere else to go

From the drama to the hoes, from the records to the shows

I gotta make it, and if they don't give me what I deserve

Then I'ma take it, I've been underrated, underestimated and hated

But I can't wait to look back and say that I made it

'Cause nowadays everyone's a rapper and I hate it



Y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh

Said y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh



I had to face my demons and embrace all of my fears

While you was out partying, chilling and sipping on some beers

I was sacrificing adolescent years

Blood, sweat, and tears to find out what music really is

And now I'm feeling, I'm feeling like the moment has arrived

Where Bobby is no longer living and Logic has revived

From his ashes, music, money, liquor, I'm fucking passed this

Lyricism that's driven from a master, you bastards



Just another day living in the hood

Just another day around the way

Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)

Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)



All I ever wanted was some financial security

And now I fuck with bitches just to mask my insecurities

'Cause pussy ain't nuttin', but my heart is sure full of something

Now I'm, colder than ever, pushing through any weather

High score flow, ain't none of y'all close to my level

Mental state of a winner in the shoes of a beginner

Visualizing my horizon through the eyes of a sinner

Noticing how the line between me and fame is getting thinner



Y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh

Said y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh

Just another day living in the hood

Just another day around the way

Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)

Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)



You know my steelo, busting shots like free throws

The young bandido, cutting records like they was kilos, ha

Is it a blessing that I'm messing with girls

That wanna undress in the back of my car, or is it just 'cause I'm a star?

Or is it just 'cause I'm a star?

Five-foot-seven, look like she fell from heaven

With an ass hotter than the devil, please call a reverend

She was black and asian, part Hispanic and part amazing

Women they feen' us, merely because we are the keenest

My heart only has one love like Serena and Venus

You know I am the meanest genius with the biggest (hey!)

See, baby girl, I know you got some problems

Just know I'm here to solve 'em, revolve 'em, cock 'em back and dissolve 'em

I swear I take care of all em' but you gotta trust it

Love it, open your heart before you lust it, now bust it, what



Just another day living in the hood

Just a—Just another—Just another—Just another day

RattPack

So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it, just cease

Got it, capiche? This is my house, you fuckers just lease

Waitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest

Black and white like a nun

These up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn

So follow your father like an apostle

Paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil

Never knowing what's gon' follow

However we never wallow in our sorrow

Just pray for tomorrow

At times my heart could be hollow

Emotions forced to be swallowed

While neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo

This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder

Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you

So I'm trying to find her

One moment she'll love you then swallow

You whole like an anaconda

The bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky

I'ma dominate the world like my name is Brain

Spit flame like propane

Bitches I overcame you know the name

Ink in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page

To numb the pain like Novocaine, motherfucker



I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me



Allow me to kill it off the brake like no traffic

Murderin' every demographic

Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic

Rip the mic to set the example

While all these muh-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples

Constant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die

Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I

But we persevere force feed enemies truth serum

We want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased

In your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest

Bustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it

I get from point A to point B by keeping it G

Ain't no killer but don't push me

If you grab the heat, you a pussy

Knuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel

I have not a single enemy

Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, in they mind

'Cause I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme

And when it comes to dames I catch planes

They catch feelings

Haters keep my name in they mouth like fillings

High as the ceiling

Y'all really don't know who your dealing with now

Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen

Thankful for every breath I'm givin'

Fuck social division

On the road to success and there ain't no time for collision

People ask ""how you get your flow so amazing""

To which I reply ""I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions""

Haters takin' shots but they never graze him

Now if pro is the opposite of con

What's the opposite of progress?

I love my country but that shit a mess

Grew up on section 8, I can attest

And now they wonder why I claim that I'm the fucking best



I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me



Now if I don't believe it y'all won't perceive it

Now run it back and retrieve it

Till you receive it in your motherfuckin' mind

Only 22 but I feel like I'm 99

Back in 1999, that's when I began to rhyme

Surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine

Daddy was smoking crack, I was raised by a single mom

Fasting every night I ain't talking bout no Ramadan

I was poor as fuck me and my mama, we didn't have a dime

At 16, the school system dismissed him and wished him well

But my mama never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?

So I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own

I left home at 17

Shortly after my mama got stabbed by fucking around in the streets

But she still breathin' which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving

So many rappers biting me you would think they was teething

And now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story"

I got a date with destiny
My heart says yeah, but can’t convince the rest of me
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me

I need redemption no need to mention my past

'Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash

The glitz, the glamour, the lights, the camera, the action

The stage, the fans, the speakers blasting

You know I want it, I need it

Don’t doubt it, I can’t live without it

This is everything I dreamed of

It’s everything I’ve ever wanted

But is it really truly in my plans

Or did God mix up my blueprints?

Did he have it right there in his hands?

Anybody give me a hint

I can feel it now I know it’s coming

And I don’t give a fuck what anybody say

I’ve fallen, I’ve risen, I chose and selected this mission

Incarceration through these bars created a prison

And I intend to do the time that the sentence is given

25 to life yeah that’s how I’m living

Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever make it

But there’s only one way I'ma know

I’m like a seed planted in the dirt

Feels like I’ve been waiting forever to grow

And maybe today is the day

And maybe tonight is the night

But one thing that I know for sure

This time I’ma get it right

Yea yea
A'ight
So we gonna do this one for like the Ratpack and shit
Is it recording?

Alright, for the real hip-hop motherfuckers, you know what I'm sayin?

Yea yea, shout out to Bobby  my engineer

For tonight's night in LA

We recording this mixtape and shit, working on the album at the same time

You know what I'm sayin?

Originary boy



Yea yea

Uh, yea

We gonna do it for 96

Yea, we gon do it for hip-hop yea

Second renaissance type shit, check



(Verse 1)

Who would have thought that painting pictures 'bout being broke

Would get me rich just like dealing coke

Like big brother used to do so we could stay afloat

I heard them guns outside my window, them gangsters would talk

Thought about the life I wanted, picked up the pen and then wrote

While they was firing, you could hear sirens

From people dialling and women crying in the phone

I was in the zone, trying to make a living

Heading to work in the morning

Nobody felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased

Until I quit my job, then my work ethic increased

Elevated to levels I ain't ever seen

Stacking this cream, living the American dream now

I'm going crazy, I ain't slept in days

Dreaming of Michael Jordan money like I slept in J's

Always shouting out my team 'cause I get all the plays

But they the ones that motivate me on depressing days

See I'm from Maryland where cats draw gats like animation

From the smallest altercation, that can lead determination

With a rapper on every corner, like the rest of the nation

Passing bars back and forth like legal examinations

As a youngin I was running wild

Me and my homies skipping school, puffing on that loud

Doing shit just to do it, 'cause we wasn't allowed

I thought I understood the world, but I was still a child, yeah

Now when my momma was at home drinking, thinking 'bout the bills

I was dreaming 'bout the mills, running round looking for thrills

I guess this is how it feels when your memory spills onto the page

And paints a picture of another age

Back in West Deer Park, chilling with shorties after dark

Cause when the sun is down, the police always want us down

Til we get older and hustle, now they try'na gun us down

We just trying to make a living off of what we've been given

Wassup

Walk on by

(Verse 2)

They call me Logic, yeah that's L-O-G-I-C

I ain't rucked up in them bitches, I just write 'bout shit I see

Cause these lyrics set me free, fuck the world, let me be

And when I feel like I can't write, that's when I hit the MPC

My talent limitless, my time limited so listen up

If you can't see the shit I see, you better get your vision up

I'm the king, watch me reign, born to rule my domain

Album ain't even in stores, they trynna sue me for my name

Shit insane, so berzerk, never complained, I just work

Chasing after my dreams like them high school skirts

Back as a youngin, spitting game, try'na get the nut in

Living life to the fullest 'cause them little things ain't nothing

My flow un-killable when I be murdering syllables

But I take my time, slow it down, check the rhyme

Perfectionist to the dime, from the womb to the tomb

I be rapping 'til I'm dying, doing everything I love

That's the life of a don, skipping school, sipping liquor

Try'na get this money quicker, bad bitches, good weed

That's the type of shit I need, lyrics bleed from my mind state

Elevate my mind and watch it rise like the crime rate

Cause sometimes I be high, and sometimes I be low

And sometimes I do shit I thought I'd never do before

My life is like a movie role that's starring me

Got these women on me

I hit the club with all my homies, and the drinks is on me

At the crib with the shorty that I met at the spot

Pretty eyes, nice lips, Grey Goose what she sips

Put my hands on her hips, 'til she puts them on her tits

Freak bitch, want the dick, biting on her finger tip

I only fuck with nice girls, I never do this type of shit

I'm thinking 'bout hitting it raw, shit I must be wiling out

But that pussy wet as hell, I think it's time to end the drought

Then I guess she could be burning, and that's not what I'm about

So I dipped out, to live another day and die another night

Cause when I'm gone that ain't go'n be the song that they recite

Waddup

It depends on your attentions, what's your aim? What's your end goal?

I had to touch down on myself, I'm in the end zone

I think I got a whole lot on my mind

Somebody tell God right now He need to hit my line



(Message)



This album was written over the course of one week

And mainly created in just four studio sessions between Logic and No. I.D.

But perfected over the course of the year that followed"

Y'all niggas overdoin' it
You gotta slow that shit down
Take your time, reevaluate your shit, it don't matter (Watch)
Niggas ain't got money, ain't got time

Fuck it, just say this shit



You and me

Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')

I can hear 'em callin' me

We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)

I live by the beat, I die by the beat, since 1990, I (I)

Live by the beat, I die by the beat, like MPC Akai

Who I name William after 'cause I get bills from these beats

Fuck the industry, you know we keepin' it real up in these streets

Came up in a world that's off its axis

All that's promised, death and taxes

Don't give a fuck who be rhyming the fastest my anxiety

Make me spit it a mile a minute

I'm stuck in a clinic like Flynn Montgomery

Take a step back, tell me right now, boy, just what your summary

Creeping through fireside

Smash the window of that fire ride

Just to see what we can snatch from up inside

'Til the flashin' lights come 'round that corner then we run and hide

Prayin' to God up in Heaven eleven at night and I got no alibi

My damn dip to Stewart Town

Best not come 'round these parts if you new in town

Wonder what my homies from back in the day livin' at, are doin' now

Running with my sister Jeannie, schooling me like Mr. Feeny

This is the first time I heard a gunshot on the block

Growing pains (Three), this the type of shit don't never stop

Here come the cops

Shooting up the hood like black ops

'Cause trigger happy police tend to trigger happy people

And some people who believe we not equal shoot up the steeple

My God, if you exist then why do you make life so hard?

If you exist the way you think is avant-garde

If you exist you got a funny way of showing it

What happens in the afterlife?

These people think they knowin' shit

And on that note, I keep it G

Like track four, ""Kick in the Door"" by Notorious B.I.G. 

Don't believe me, look that shit up, I promise you'll find the key

To that punchline, feelin' just fine

Let the abyss of my mind, my mind consume

Snap my fingers like Thanos and Bobby Boy bringin' the doom

'Cause I'm 6:30, killin' shit, hands down and dirty

That white boy can't rap, he talk good and act nerdy

I just texted Erykah Badu

To let her know what I'm gon' to do

Sample ""Dreamflower"" by Tarika Blue

That's cool with you?

Yeah, that's fine, baby, all gravy

Long as you know you my baby

And I beat yo' daddy like if he ever cheat on me

I mean she don't own the sample but she might as well

'Cause her and Dilla paved the way for all I got, and, well

I'ma show my gratitude, no attitude, no auto-tune like T-Pain

Doin' Unplugged, I'm unplugged, like Trinity

Wonder how the people gonna remember me, goddamn

Switch up the plan

We all say it, we all claim it but it's no use

The greatest rapper alive is probably stacking produce

Introduce you to my train of thought

Snapping on a track like the illest conductor

With no contradiction

I brought my heart to the table

Fact and never fiction, fuck a fable

Ready and willing you better believe I'm able to spit

Power through these lines faster than fiber-optic cable, I'm gone



You and me

Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')

I can hear 'em callin' me

We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)

You and me

Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')

Watch

From the bottom

When you come from the bottom, you ain't get no chances, man

I'ma do this shit 'til the Fourth Of July, blow up straight to the sky (Watch)

Nigga fuck it, we high

I remember when a nigga had to ask for money

It's been a long time since I had to do that shit (Watch)

This shit ain't free

I got the roof over my head and a bed, nigga, my bitch givin' me head

I'd rather get money instead

Man, it's Bobby Boy Records in this bitch

Y'all niggas better write this shit down (It don't matter)

'Cause 10 years from now, we on top

And we ain't never gon' stop

All money in (Watch)



This album marks the reunion of Logic and No I.D. 

For the first time in six years

Since the inception of its predecessor"

Came a long way from bus stops and washing dishes
From rags to bitches
Stovetop to Mastro's, man, this shit is delicious
People denying my past like that shit is fictitious
I'm Spike Spiegel, but I'm known to be vicious

I get under people's skin like stitches

No strings attached, I just let it dissolve

Give it time and then let it resolve

It's been a minute now, my style feeling infinite now

Used to people pulling me down, it ain't shit to me now

Don't let it get to me now

Threw out my phone, they can't get to me now

Keep it humble, but love to get big head

Bad bitches wanna fuck me, I get money instead

I mean what's rap without a little braggadocio?

Fuck people telling me to rap just how I'm supposed to

Most people wanna tell you what to do

'Cause it's what they wanna do if they had an opportunity to

But too scared

That's why they live vicariously through you

Logic, what you should do is rap like

Uh, uh, nah, I'd rather not

That's why I'm in a mansion and you sleeping on a cot

But you still study everything I drop

Too many people wanna tell you what you can and cannot

Go to school, get a job, get married and have kids

People gon' tell you what to do for long as you live

Break the cycle, and shoot for the stars, Moonwalk like Michael

To be a leader, first, you gotta be a disciple



(It's a celebration)

For the beat, the rhymes, the streets, the dimes (It's a celebration, y'all)

You wanna try to eat, motherfucker, this my time (It's a celebration)

For the beat, the rhymes, the streets, the dimes

You wanna try to eat, motherfucker, this my time

Ayy, it's a celebration, y'all, celebration now

Wherever I go in the nation, they celebrating my style

It's a celebration, y'all, celebration now (Yeah)

Wherever I go in the nation, they celebrate the style



Look

I can't front, we was hyped up for some nosebleeds

Now we sitting courtside, still posted in my white tee

I'm a Golden State Warrior when I'm spittin' this

Like KD from MD, that's Montrose, so venomous

You know it's me, Silas never jumpin' for your bitch ass

I'm hopping on a plane that's first class

'Member back in the day, we used to fast

Had no money in the bank account

My cousin showed me, pushing weight

Almost stabbed at the transit in the dead of the night

These fucking zombies, but really that's beyond me

Tryna live my dreams from everything that I seen as a young man

So if you see me rapping, know I got the upper hand

But on the other hand, you see a couple rubber bands

And now Logic really out here makin' dreams come true

Bobby Boy Records spittin' thorough

Every time I grab the mic, I'm paintin' murals

Doing shows in other countries, coming back with Euros

This that type of flow that really make your girl go



I'm marvelous, I'm all of this

That's why your girl all on my dick

I make 'em cum, boy, you make 'em sick

My net worth get the bank grossed out

No I.D. up on the beat, but 6ix, he killing, no doubt

This a revelation, memories when I drive the M5 or the bus station

I have evolved, you's a motherfuckin' crustacean

What more can I say? Run it back and they hit replay

Bobby Boy Records, yeah, we celebratin' all day

Crazy how one day, the legends forget that they equal
On this Under Pressure sequel
We not taking it back, we keepin' it pushing
People scared of change
But you'll find me deep in the cushion

Even when I win, it feel like I'm losing

Listening to beats, in the Bimmer cruisin'

I think I got another hit, I could feel my body bruisin'

What's the conclusion of rappin'?

My hypothesis, I'm darker than Gotham is

Like reading Nostradamus at 90 degrees

You better believe

I know how to turn a profit with ease

Diacritical lifestyle, I'm always overseas

Hurricane Bobby in the studio blowing trees

What's the topic? I drop it

Fuck around then leave them all concussed

When I bust, no thrust, this world we livin' in is fucked

Industry rule number four thousand and eighty one

Your new shit ain't good as your old shit

'Til your new shit is your old shit, son

And then some, gotta get some

I wear this 24 karat solid gold Rollie for my son

As an heirloom, not for looking dope as I rhyme

As a representation to give your family your time

If you're searching for love in the industry you'll be let down

They don't love you 'til you dead and then they call you profound

No matter how mainstream you was in the end, you still underground

That's the truth, feeling close to the cliff, like Rick Dalton in the booth

Money ain't the key to happiness and this the proof

Modern day rap is like a golden era spoof

But a few of us were searching within the second renaissance

And I know that my debutantes

Been keeping the legacy going

By flowing so involuntarily seamless

Me and my team is finally reaping

What we been sowing like a seamstress

I said I'm on one, I know I'm unsung

Was livin' my life backward like Tariq on Undun

And now they wonder how I got over son (Do you want more?)

Hell yeah, now check the method

I been livin' outside of pages for ages

Now I'm back, Chocolate City, home of percussion, Maryland on my back

From Takoma Park, all the way to Southeast DC

It feel like forever ago, it feel like BC

Everlasting life, kickin' rhymes in the parking lot at night

Inhale, exhale, people hate

Oh well, 2012

Dreamin' I'm a freshman on XXL

2013, on the cover XXL

Livin' life behind these bars with no intention of postin' bail

'Cause I prevail

But that's a story for another time

Story for another rhyme

And on my darkest days, I know that the sun will shine, eventually

Greatest lyricist to ever do it, yeah essentially

And if we're being modest then potentially

And if we're being humble then...





Oh shit, it's Raquel, she's a fuckin thot

Ayy, fuck you guys, fuck you guys

Suck my dick

Straight on the basement mic

Ayy, man fuck all these punchlines and shit man

I just wanna tell a story, I just wanna have some fun

Back in the basement type shit



Ayo, once upon a time a couple of guys from out this world

Was talkin' rap and hip hop with a young synthetic girl

The year was 2115 at Babel Space Station

Was home to the very last of the human population

The captain name was Thomas, the infantry man was Kai

And he's the man that discovered the Ultra85

Accompanied by a girl inside their ear, her name was Thalia

Made of ones and zeros, she was a program

You could ask her any question even about the fall of man

Then one day they discovered a planet in deep space

That nobody before them had ever found in they database

I mean, maybe it's the place that's meant for the human race

The planet Paradise, Kai said that time is my God

It be very nice, traveling through outer space

We done had some scary nights

We done had some scary fights

All about that rap shit, how I like that trap shit

Thomas flood every bap shit

I wish God was real, I wish I could just get raptured

What if this planet full of aliens and we get captured?

Don't think that way my son

Everything gon' be fine, we finna have some fun

And if by chance we do come across an alien

I'ma blow his ass away with this here molecular gun

Set to kill, never stun

Wagwan, we get it done

Now the ship is enterin' the atmosphere (Ten, nine)

We gon' take a look around and get the hell up outta here (Eight, seven)

We gon' double check that it's habitable and livable for man (Six, five)

And no matter what happens you know that we gone stick to the plan (Four, three)

Understood? Understand, all good? Let's get it then (Two, one)

Once they touched down nobody could hear a sound

'Til they opened up the ship door, that rappelled to the ground

What they found, a planet full of life

A planet full of shit they never seen

Straight up out a movie scene

On some Tarantino meets Christopher Nolan, nah mean?

Walk around the planet for hours, they was exhausted

If it wasn't for the music in they ears, they would have lost it

The seventh album by a musician they both revered

First time this planet heard it, let's call it a world premiere

Thomas thinkin' about a picture of his girl

That he left on the Aquarius Three in his dresser

Wishin' he could undress her

Give it up like no lesser

Kai thinkin' nuts like a professor

Wondering if the oxygen on this planet fresher

Now is it us or is the natural life on this world the aggressor?

All the negative shit inside of his head, he need a refresher

Two men here to save the world, no pressure"

I started from the bottom, now my neighborhood is gated
They say, ""Drink to your accomplishments,"" so every night I'm faded
Feel like every other day, me and somebody new related
You're my sister, cousin, brother from the other side? (The other side)
Well, I don't know who told you that (My mama)

Well, she fucking lied

Ayy, wake up, wake up, get your cake up

Cut it up like it's cocaine, shake up

All the streets with all these beats

I body beats, I'm not discreet (Per-Per-Perfect)

This is how I feel on the inside

All you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide

You worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter

You gots to get it through your head

You won't ever get no handout

Fuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out (Per-Per-Perfect)

My flow increased, my dough increased

You know I leave them all deceased

I am a fucking beast, I'm from the East

I keep the peace, don't need a piece

But I keep a piece, got it capiche?

That boy gon' eat, this is a feast

Once I release, I'm smokin' trees

I bought my shit, I don't need no lease

So fuck you up like Master P (Perfect)

This shit right here a masterpiece, I'm comin' in hot like the police

Shooting my shot like the police

All on the block like the policemen, who gon' (Stop, stop)

The police from leaving bodies in the motherfuckin' streets, man? (Fire, per-per-perfect)

Paper chasin' on occasion

West Deer Park, that's my location

Life and death was what we was facin'

Boy, gotta get that motivation

Back in the basement

Look at my idols, I'm feelin' adjacent

Doin' the shit that I wish I was doing, I'm feelin' impatient

Throwin' parties and catching cases

That's the life, but that shit basic

I've cooked crack, I can't erase it

If I could, would not replace it

Grew up all alone

Had to teach myself to tie my laces

What's the deal?

I'ma play the field

Rattpack, we keep it real

Nothin' but love for the people that paved the way

So a brother like me, he can get it today

Antwan, Erykah and 3K

Can't forget those ain't here today

R.I.P. JD and Pimp C

Payin' respect, so don't hold it against me

Devil he callin' me, he love to tempt me

God exempt me, why you sent me here?

What I think about year to year

What I've been through these people only see through a peep hole, yeah

Not a single one got an idea

So I write it down on this page

Feel like I'm 35 times my age

Look in the mirror don't know what to say

But I'm happy the man I is



Yeah, yeah

I said I'm happy the man I is

And I'm proud of the man I've become

I'm proud that I'm from a slum

I never got cold, I never got numb

Except from the winter time and then some

I transcend and I transform

Poetic vision in rare form

Growing up, nobody there for him

I promise when I have a family I'ma be there for 'em

I love hip-hop

Hatin' motherfucker, go kick rocks

No matter what happen I never gon' stop

Like Cole said if they don't know yo' dreams

Then they can't shoot 'em down

But I'ma let the world know

'Cause I'm too high up to hit the ground

This shit right here is like therapy, spit it verily

I ain't perfect, I got problems, I got issues like People magazine

Shoot from the hip and reload the magazine

I wish I could just go on forever, forever, ever and ever

But this rhyme

Ill as it is divine

Gon' be cut short today 'cause I'm out of studio time

Only thought I was recording these horns and not no rhyme

What can I say? Inspiration hits at any time

So I guess I'll have to conclude all my thoughts another time

Another rhyme

Another— Ano— i— wo— a— rhyme

Smoking dope high as a kite

Only when that babysitter at the crib, though

Take my shorty to Nobu and dig up in her rib though, ayy, yeah

(Take my shorty to Nobu and dig up in her rib though, yeah)

'Cause back in my day it was food stamps

And I love my wife like I am Chance

I bet you'd rap about the shit me and him rap about

I've upgraded while they waited, will they love it, will they hate it?

Who gives a fuck though?

Rappers praying they next, this shit is cutthroat

I'm livin' on another planet

My manic depression make me constantly wanna panic

I'm stressing on stage, pretendin' everybody undressing

I think I'll never learn my lesson, but fuck it all, it doesn't matter

Ayo, I'm on a lyrical, poetic rhetoric

Lyrical miracle, satirical shit

If you don't like my conscious rap, you won't like my material shit

Love him or hate him, everybody know Logic can spit

Used to be up to date on that rap political shit

But nowadays I'm up to my elbows

And every single inch of my body in my baby's shit

I could tell you more about diapers than modern rappers in cyphers

I used to be about the B-Rabbits and Mekhi Phifers

Hit the stage, grip the mic and murder you like a pro-lifer

But I'm done now, I got a son now

Fuck the rap game, I'm done now

Goddamn, already had a hard life once

Am I supposed to recreate it every album for you cunts? Okay

You want to hear about my everyday

I wake up, I wake my son up, then I feed him

And lead him into his car seat

Drive up the street down to Target

Don't do hard drugs or beat my wife

But the paparazzi still wanna start shit

I don't answer their questions, I leave 'em in the dark, bitch

Then I walk through the automatic doors

A couple fans spot me but, shit, I ain't on tour

I ain't trying to ignore her

But I head to aisle four 'cause my drawers stank as fuck

And I need some new drawers

Then I spot some more fans, stan hella hardcore (Can I have a picture?)

Asking for a pic and I say sure

Scratch my dick and shake his hand

Shaking uncontrollably, he tells me I'm the man

Now I'm headed to aisle three for some Bounty paper towels

I also grab some wet wipes to clean the shit from my bowels

A really hot girl walks by with a fat ass

But I'm just wondering if Hefty really holds the most trash

Forgot my card at home, thank God I brought some cash

Then I grab some Preparation H for the critics up my ass

Head to aisle five for some Sgt. Smash cereal

Is this want you wanted, everyday life material?

I'm not a kid anymore and be sure shit's boring

Made it out the basement, now my bank account soaring

Most exciting part of my life is probably touring

Don't get me wrong, I love fans in every single city

But hotels suck and the internet is shitty

I mean, why rap about everyday shit

When I could murder punch lines and sound dope like this?

It's what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?

This No Pressure shit kinda got us reacquainted

I'm happy you could join me in this universe I painted

Such a beautiful feeling, I really can't explain it

I hit the stage and like a thousand bitches fainted (Nigga, you ain't shit)

Damn, that boy, he back at it again

Droppin’ bars when I pick up the pen, so let’s begin

No I.D. my mentor, but it's time for the story’s end, yeah

I love this BPM, but this a different style (Woo)

I never been this happy before, this a different smile

Hey, yeah, this that barbecue music

Life is a blessing and a curse depending how you use it

Some days I'm happy, some days I'm fucked up

Some days I tell the voice in my head to shut the fuck up

I go for my homie, I gots to shine, homie

All I do is grind, homie, all I do is rhyme

I provide for mine, homie, uh, uh, y'all know me (Yeah, yeah, y'all know me, yeah)

I started with just a dollar and a dream

Like Jermaine in '09, know what I mean?

Fresh on the scene like a first take

I dropped my first tape then felt the earth shake

But let's accelerate

Dropped the second tape, 2011, and now we elevate

Def Jam wanna sign me, it's time to celebrate

But little did I know, I had so much further to go

Let's take a trip down memory lane

Logic arrived and he fucked up the game, simple and plain

Never scared to do it different, no two albums sound the same

I got tracks with Wu Tang and 2 Chainz, Killer Mike and Gucci Mane

Rap shit, trap shit, you know I do it with no shame

Spit the illest yoke or flame, always go against the grain

I was fly before the fame, before I could afford a plane

Touch down like Notre Dame to get as high as my strain

2014 release day, I need morphine

Def Jam under shipped me, not a CD on the rack

RattPack had to ask 'em to unbox it in the back

What the fuck is that? Honestly, it sound like a fable

Fast forward, 2020, I'm the face of the label and I am

Who gives a fuck about the leak when you got the well?

Watch me excel, propel, then ghost the fuck out like Dave Chappelle

You the illest, pray tell, I'm like God before Lucifer fell, I raised hell

Had bars when I was broke 'cause I couldn't raise bail

But now my bars gold 'cause I'm Wall Street, broker

Money like I sell coca, livin' La Vida Loca shit

That ain't a line just to flex, just to let you know you next

If you put your mind to it, you can do it

Trust me 'cause I been through it, now get to it, ain't nothin' to it



Actually living your life is exponentially different from just being alive"

Depression, anxiety got ahold of me
'Cause people say they want the older me
Well, I'm thirty, this the oldest me
Behold it's me, the piece of shit that's not good enough
Not black enough, not hood enough

Not rich enough, not poor enough

My heart has poured enough

I been beaten and battered, my confidence shattered

Been broken and tattered

I'm constantly second guessin' if my profession is worth it on my mental state

Writin' this from a dark place with humility and grace

Peace, love, and positivity was my nativity

But not when socials are in my vicinity

I'm not runnin' from the internet

My god, I was at its birth, I've been a vet

Goin' berserk like Peter down in InterTech, yo, ayy

It's deeper than the surface, I'm searchin' for purpose

I'm tired of searchin' for Logic on Google on purpose just to read that I'm worthless

I remember makin' music alone, just a pen and a microphone

But nowadays it's hard to get in the zone

Writin' rhymes was easy before the fame

Now I'm constantly overthinkin' every line, it's a shame

Rap used to fill me with joy, now it's nothin' but pain

I'm stuck in the game, tryna get back from where I came

I write this letter for the person who's listenin'

Fed up and tired of people dismissin' 'em, I'm with you

I been through what you been through

No amount of money can take away the feelin' of insecurity

Only through maturity can we overcome

Feel like I've been overrun, feel like it's over, I'm done

Whoever told you success gon' make you happy? You been lied to

All of my dreams came true but I bleed and cry too

Never been perfect, I failed every time I tried to

Feelin' hated and underappreciated

Every time I look in the mirror, I wonder, ""Why you?""

Shit, I'd love to end this on some positive shit

Hit you with punchlines instead of some derogative shit

But it's okay to be sad sometimes and tired of shit, I guess



And people say, ""Well you're just out for money""

I say, ""That's none of your business""

You see, a lot of people don't feel happy

Unless they have another thing beyond money, which is called status

And status, to a very large extent in our economy consists in

In having this thing and that thing and the other thing, and having a swimming pool

A, uh, Ferrari, uh, certain kind of clothes and uh, certain kind of house

And so on, and so on, and so on

And we think, uh, we need all that

Because we haven't asked ourselves whether that was what we really wanted

They all think they gotta have this, they gotta have that

And uh, they don't really want it

If they sat back and considered, ""Do I need all that? Is this trip really necessary?""

They would come to the conclusion that it wasn't, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha"

I got enough M's in the bank to make ends meet

Oh my God, get gritty, '96 P Diddy, setting fire to the city

Keep it real, keep it true, sicker then the flu

You can smoke government dope and not get higher then my IQ

Are you ready? I'm calm my arms are steady

I'm armed and ready, digging in you like a machete

Surprise, confetti

You going to need more than bed rest when I hit you with these 26 bullets, no excess

I never went to school, never went to MIT, but my imagination is out of this world like MIB

Who are you to me? These other rappers envy me, the MVP, born and raised in MD, get it B

Don't get it confused, fuck the style everyone use

Switch up the rhythm every track, flows, I never double use

X marks the spot, every day I give what I got

That's why I'm on top, steady running shit and you not

You steadily flop, every album steadily drop

Think you can do it 'cause I do it? Come now, boy, better stop

Trying to take me out? My advice is aim for the top

Come on, play it, man

Play that shit, man

Come on, nigga, play that shit



Never one to flip scripts

I'm more raw then imaginary rubbers

Rain in the gutter, my talented knife cutter

Always flowing venomous, never rolling in regiments

Whipping read to intelligence, you copy then we settle in

Possibilities is endless, you'll never catch me pen-less

Suicidal lyrics, controversy like stem-cell research

Ain't no time to compromise, my rhymes immortalized

Visualize as I vocalize, worldly lies, that we're hypnotized

Staring into space like the Enterprise

Contemplating on words that shall arise

Mentality merciless, never sympathize

Yeah

Smoking weed in gazebos, incognito

Attracting more microphones than Magneto and that's real

Blunts keep rolling like bitches on E pills"

I've spoken these words before but not on the radio
To be born free is to be born in debt
To live in freedom without fighting slavery
To profiteer
I have met Southerners who expect and fear a Negro insurrection

I see no purpose in withholding this from general discussion

There may be those within that outcast ten percent of the American people who someday will strike back at their oppressors

But to put down that mob, a mob would riot

I'd like to ask, please: who will put down that mob?

I'm an overpaid producer with pleasant reasons to rejoice, and I do

In the wholesome practicability of the profit system

But surely, my right to having more than enough is cancelled

If I don't use that more to help those who have less

I owe the very profit I make to the people I make it from

If this is radicalism, it comes automatically to most of us in show business

It being generally agreed that any public man owes his position to the public

That's what I mean when I say I'm your obedient servant

We must, each day, earn what we own

A healthy man owes to the sick all that he can do for them

An educated man owes to the ignorant all that he can do for them

A free man owes to the world's slaves all that he can do for them

And what is to be done is more, much more, than good works

Christmas baskets, bonuses and tips, and bread and circuses

There is only one thing to be done with slaves

Free them

If we can't die in behalf of progress, we can live for it

Progress, we Americans take to mean, a fuller realization of democracy

The measure of progress, as we understand it, is the measure of equality enjoyed by all men

We can do something about that

The way our fighting brothers and sisters looked at it

Some of them dead as I speak these words

The way they looked at it, we're lucky

And they're right, we're lucky to be alive

But only if our lives make life itself worth dying for

We must be worthy of our luck or we are damned

Our lives were spared, but this is merely the silliest of accidents

Unless we put the gift of life to the hard employments of justice

If we waste that gift, we won't have anywhere to hide from the indignation of history

I want to say this

The morality of the auction block is out of date

There is no room in the American century for Jim Crow

Tomorrow's democracy discriminates against discrimination

Its charter won't include the freedom to end freedom

Race hate isn't human nature, race hate is the abandonment of human nature

But this is true

There are alibis for the phenomenal excuses, economic and social

But the brutal fact is simply this

Where the racist lies acceptable, there is corruption

The race haters must be stopped, the lynchings must be stopped

The murders must be avenged

I come in that boy's name and in the name of all, who, in this land of ours, have no voice of their own

I come with a call for action

This is the time for it

I call for action against the cause of riot

It won't surprise me if I'm accused in some quarters of inciting to riot

Well, I'm very interested in riots, I'm very interested in avoiding them

So I call for action against the cause of riots

Law is the best action, the most decisive

It's in the people's power to see to it that what makes lynchings and starts wars is dealt with

Not by well-wishers, but by policemen, and I mean good policemen

Over several generations, maybe there'll be men who can't be weaned away from the fascist vices of race hate

But we should deny such men responsibility in public affairs

Exactly as we deny responsibility to the wretched victims of the drug habit

There are laws against peddling dope

There can be laws against peddling race hate

But every man has the right to his own opinion as an American boasts

But race hate is not an opinion, it's a phobia

It isn't a viewpoint, race hate is a disease

In a people's world, the incurable racist has no rights

He must be deprived of influence in a people's government

He must be segregated, as he himself would segregate the colored and semitic peoples

Anything very big is very simple

If there's a big race question, there's a big answer to it

And a big answer is simple, like the word ""no""

America can write her name across this century, and so she will

If we, the people, brown and black and red

Rise now to the great occasion of our brotherhood

It will take courage

It calls for the doing of great deeds, which means the dreaming of great dreams

Giving the world back to its inhabitants is too big a job for the merely practical

No one of us will live to see a blameless peace

We strive and pray and die for what will be here when we're gone

Our children's children are the ancestors of a free people

To the generations: the fight is worth it

And that just about means that my time is up

When my time's up, I remain as always, obediently yours

Only led me to battle depression

And tell you what's good and what's not

And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot

They tear it apart like hyenas that's here for the dreamers

That's here for the people that know what I'm sayin'

'Cause people just won't let 'em live

And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em

But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside (On inside)

And they wonder why we all hide, shit (Why we all hide, shit)

Maybe I'm just overthinkin'

Or maybe I'm just over smokin' and drinkin'

And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate

Sit in the corner and think of a better day

Maybe this bullet can help me to get away

I just cannot seem to think of a better way

Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'

That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'

Even when I'm here and I'm a bitch, I'm a fag

I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least

I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)

""You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole""

""You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,"" yeah

These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now

I'm tryna swim but I think I'ma drown

So I'ma turn my feelin' into a sound

And play it when nobody else is around

Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground

I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich

I wish I could just get up out of this bitch (Out of this bitch)

Big bills like a platypus

A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis

I'm lookin' for the smoke 'cause you motherfuckers are scatterin'

Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate man

I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin

And I'm bringin' the bandana back in the fuckin' cabana again

The handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back

And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap

I sound like a fuckin' millionaire with the Darringer with a hair trigger

'Bout to bear hug your fuckin' terrier to ""Ric Flair Drip""

And y'all couldn't hold the candle at a prayer vigil

When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct

I'm about to bare knuckle it, nah fuck it

I'm gonna go upside the head with a Nantucket

You're in a cab—

I'm in a cabana and a Janet

I'm in a cabana chantin' all this stand up banter

While you don't got the stamina, ya lackin' the stamina

Ya lackin' the stamina while ya divorcin' Harrison Ford

She's a pretty young lady, pullin' at my heartstrings
Pretty young girl, take my hand
I'll be your man, I'll be your man

I don't think you know, all the things you do to me

It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before

Yeah, before

And I, and I–



I'm fucked up

I mean, I really am hurt

You're new and you're beautiful

But experience tells me this ain't gonna work

You're just like all the rest, suffering in disguise

Behind those beautiful eyes, lies, lies, and I

Just can't do it again, I just don't wanna pretend

That it'll work in the end

Or if it don't, we'll be friends

My heart can't take no more, I'm sincerely sure

But if that shit was true, why in the hell am I singing for?



A pretty young girl, doin' pretty young things

She's a pretty young lady, pullin' at my heartstrings

Pretty young girl, take my hand

I'll be your man, I'll be your man

I don't think you know, all the things you do to me

It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before



Yeah, last shorty, I ain't have no free time

Gave her all my everything, ain't never had no me-time

Too scared to commit, no, don't want no rewind

I could give a fuck what the world think, we fine

I've been feelin' shook, don't know where to look

Last girl got me sprung, threw out my black book

Now I ain't got no Rolodex, but I ain't lookin' back, though

I ain't jumpin' back up in the game, show me the backdoor

I ain't got no time for thots, that shit is a bad idea

I don't got no time for hoes, I only want a good girl who knows

How to get wild with it, start out shy wit' it

Like she from the 3-1-2 'til I hit it

Shorty know your limits, get up in it, yeah, I'm good

I'm good, I'm good



And she's a pretty young girl, doin' pretty young things

She's a pretty young lady, pullin' at my heartstrings

Pretty young girl, take my hand

I'll be your man, I'll be your man

I don't think you know, all the things you do to me

It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before

I don't think you know, all the things you do to me

It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before



Y'all–y'all walkin' around instead of helpin' us out, right?

Right, no lies

Hahaha, alright"

I wish I could watch you when you sleep

I knew you before you knew me

Holy shit, I am a creep

I come to your job, just to buy some shit I don't need

Just to see your pretty face

It's probably odd I fantasize about your sweet love and embrace

Maybe one day, she'll be mine

I guess we'll all know in due time

I've got a heavy heart and a lot on my mind

But, beautiful girl, you're one of a kind

I'm not a stalker, but I go shopping

More than I need to, just to see you

I'm not a stalker, but I go shopping just to see you

Be lying if I said I didn't want to hit it now

On a hunnid, that thought been running through my mind

'Cause baby girl, you're just too fine

But first, I want to make you mine

Study you like constellations, I wonder what make you shine

On that 9-to-5 grind, but girl, you got bigger dreams

If there's no one there to tell you you're destined for bigger things

I'll be the one to let you know you're brighter than the sun

More beautiful than any girl I've seen where I'm from

By any girl ever, anywhere I might have gone

I only have eyes for you, that's why I wrote this song

Life's changing fast, I feel like I don't have long

To tell you anything you want, girl, you can do it

And I'ma be there when you make it, smiling like I knew it

I've given my heart away just to have it beaten up

That's a heart attack, now my shit don't beat enough

But ever since the day we met, girl, I could read your bluff

If I wrote you letters every day, would you read the stuff?

Girl, if I gave you my everything, would it be enough?

The road is hard, and my current situation is rough

They say there's plenty more fish in the sea

But you're the only one God made just for me

Sometimes I wonder if you know I exist

Or if I told you how I felt, would you be like

""Hold up, who the fuck is this?""

Sometimes it feel like I'm inside a love movie

But I'm the extra in the background, truly

Wishing that he had the leading lady

But I guess it wasn't written for me, maybe

Unless I flip the script and just ignore the words read

Sweep you off your feet with the all the things I never said

'Cause every man you gave your heart before me, they blew it

I just wish I had the chance to show you how I do it

Every man before me, man, they blew it

I just wish I could show you, I'd be like

I coulda never imagine that this shit here could happen

Went from the basement to thirty million just off of rappin'

Young Sinatra, that boy that brought you so many classics

Ain't never comin' with nothin' less than the illest tactics

Thought the series was over, but we just gettin' started

I won't ever leave this rap shit, no I can't depart it

From the trap to the boom bap

To Young Sinatra to Tarantino

We know he do that

Bitch, I got the flame, who dat?

I'm the new Kanye when they was like ""Who Kanye?""

I got that fire in my soul to make these classics, ay

I decided to write this letter on a private jet

'Cause in many ways it still feel like I ain't made it yet

For every goal I attain, I set like ten more

But I had to take a break to write you, that's for sure

Take a moment and celebrate how we all alive

Had to write this letter here over a Nujabes vibe

Fuck that rapper shit, fuck a punchline

This for every single fan that know every single line

So I'm saying thank you for loving me

For setting me free and letting me be me



Thank you, thank you

Unless I need, this world is greed, I lead by example with ample

Education, my lyricism is here to imprison your vision

The fallacy society has rejected, I'm here to protect it

Everybody dies in this world we live in, but not everybody tries, but everybody lies

You can't take, take money with you when you die so spend it and don't look back like an addict in recovery

But also don't blow it, you know it, and don't be a coward, but don't be too heroic

Live your life to the fullest, don't push it or pull it

Don't murder others 'cause you disagree with their beliefs

We all the same underneath

I had some shit I had to get off of my chest in that first verse

But this verse come first when it comes to importance of message

Do what you love, do what you love, do what–, do what–, do what you love

Don't do it, do it, do it, for society

Break free from the cycle, don't be scared to walk like Michael on the moon

Rattpack, beat up the tune so much more, it's comin' soon

Yeah I've been goin', I'm already knowin', Bobby been flowin'

My shit get around like a woman that's hoin', my body been growin', my mind been growin'

I'm already knowin' that I'm gon' die one day, you gon' die one day, we all 'gon die one day

God already got the date set, so live your life, live yo life

Yeah you live it, that's a bet, because if you don't live it in the end you gon' be filled with regret, bet



This what you all been waitin' for ain't it?

You are watching a master at work

Rap game homie, I been waitin' for the payment

All these little rappers come and go, I wonder where they went

Ten years of runnin', yeah we came up from the basement

This what you all been waitin' for ain't it?

Hold up let me get up in it now

Bitch, I'm here to win it now

L-O-G-I-C, I'm feeling free, I'm finna bring it now

If you know the words take a step back and sing it now

Never thought I'd have to, but I keep the windows tinted now

Like, la-di-da-di, who got the keys to my Audi?

Last time I said, it went viral, I don't fuck with nobody

And I don't fuck with you, you, them, her and him too

'Cause none of y'all know a fucking thing 'bout what I been through

And all that superficial shit you love I'm just not into

And when it comes to gettin' deep in this rap shit I've been to

Like the pussy, don't push me

I ain't no killer, but you know the rest

You think I caught the holy spirit how I'm feelin' blessed

Ain't no contest to all this wack shit, it just ain't no test

Step and get laid to rest, boy, step and get laid to rest

And ain't no ""S"" on my chest but I'm still gunnin'

While half of these motherfuckers still runnin'

I've learned everything I've attained and they steal from him

Like God damn, I'm the motherfuckin' man

Used to call you a hater, you a motherfuckin' stan

Ain't nobody built himself a brand like me

I ain't signed a shoe deal 'cause I'm waitin' for Nike

To recognize all these youngins wanna be just like me

Cut the check for 20 Million right now and we might see

Everybody rockin' my kicks, preachin' positivity

I get up, I get up



I get up, when I'm down

Had enough, almost drowned, when shit rough

I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground

I get up, I get up

I get up, uh, uh

Had enough, almost drowned, when shit rough

I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground

I get up, I get up

I get up



Never address me as ""Robert"" unless it's about that Dinero

Far from a hero, I ain't never savin' hoes

I'm not defined by these clothes, and zeros

It don't matter if you got six dollars or six figures on the creep

'Cause in the end we all six feet deep

Meanwhile, I'll be immortalized on the 6ix beat

Flashbacks and havin' visions way back in G'Burg

Every single one of my homies and me work

Cuttin' had to get up out it, make a hit, forget about it

Youngin' wit' a dream but nobody gave a shit about it

Ten years later pick up a pen, write a hit about it

And back then I thought I'd be defined by how good I rhyme

Not like these rappers with shit flows, but look good online

Not made to feel bad for speakin' bout this shit on my mind

Or called a faggot or nigger or cracker who wish he was blacker

I wish I could face my homophobic, racist attacker and smack the shit outta they ass as peaceful is possible

It's highly improbable, it's stoppable

But still, way too many people feel how I feel

That's on the real, on the real, on the motherfuckin' real



I get up, when I'm down

Had enough, almost drowned, when shit rough

I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground

Ayo motherfuckin' Trump said that shit on my last album but you wasn't tapping in

Fuck a mumble let's make America rap again

Industry don't give a fuck about rap or what's happenin'

Fuck a Hype Beast, bitch, now who seein' me?

Nobody reports the music, this shit, this rap TMZ

Nowadays everyone divided, so I collided with headlines to preach that

Go 'head now boy and preach that

Wash my hands of this negativity, word to Three Stacks

So fresh, so clean, who the illest on the scene?

Wu-Tang, get the cream

Sinatra 'gon reign supreme

Hoping your mental get out your feelins like dental

This shit is consequential, lightin' a fire to the game

Can you rappers feel the flame? Nah, this shit won't be the same

Fuck a rap beef, I promise I want all of y'all to prosper

But deep down you know it's only 'gon be one Mufasa

I'm the king, fuck the bling, but just might make you kiss the ring

All these rappers I came up on, I surpassed, I know it sting now

Don't try to twist my words and turn that into some shit

I love all you motherfuckers, just want to hear you spit

Dropped my last shit, the whole wide world applauded it

Game still ain't giving me my credit so I'ma audit it

I'm heartless like Kanye in '08

Yeah that's word to NO I.D

Now they all know who I be

I'm callin' out Jay-Z to jump up on the track with me and smack the whole industry

Show 'em what that real rap do

I hope to hear from Guru, woo!"

We gon' let this shit rock
Hey
That's the Cole hey from back in the day
Hey yeah

Just a youngin' with a dream

Tryna get this money, yeah I'm tryin' get this cream

Not a lot know what I mean, for this rap shit I'm a fiend

Not one to talk about poppin' pills and sippin' lean

Just a passin' for pussy I'm tryin' to get up in the spleen

This is my mentality rappin' at nineteen

Back in Maryland just tryin' to break out on the scene

Buyin' fake chains at the mall so girls be like ""ooh he clean""

Daydreams that my life is like a movie scene

Sippin' liquor puffin' green so obsene

Ridin' 'round the city with my homies in a gat

We was lookin' for trouble now where's it at

Paint the picture like Picasso, matter fact like Sam Spratt

Even younger I was trippin' skippin' school writin' raps

Never on the road but on the roll like them craps

Check the facts

Endless rhyme books in my back pack

Like that, uh

I guess I acted out from lack of a father figure

Go figure performin' at open mics wishin' I could go bigger

I was never in it for the money like a gold digger

Every time my daddy call me he be like ""ayo nigga, where the money at""

Now that's what he say, ""little boy you know you know I saw you on a PJ

When you gon' fly me out, when you gon' smoke me out?""

Always throw demands out, motherfuck a hand out

All I ever wanted was a daddy

But that man priority was huggin' with a fatty

But I'm glad he did cuz it made me who I am

Now I'm the man I always wish he would've been

And never started smokin' crack imagine just what could of been, damn

Always felt like somethin' it missin'

Wish we could have played catch, had talks, and went fishin'

But had no one there to listen

Now it feels like my life mission is to be the best dad when the time comes

For my daughter and my son when the time come

Teach them 'bout their heritage and where they come from

Teach them 'bout their family history and then some



I've been on the grind tryin' find my way (Ayo, ayo aye)

People come and go but I'ma be the one to stay (Ayo, ayo aye)

Bobby don't do it to 'em

You're beautiful and you don't gotta prove it to 'em

Come on, come on Bobby, you ain't shit though

Why your personality be split though

One minute it's PLP, the next that shit be slit throats

Devil and an angel on my shoulder, that's my conscious

Greatest rapper alive but never actin' Pontius

Keep yourself in check like a dollar amount

You ain't better than nobody based on your dollar amount

Yeah you've grown accustomed to the lifestyle but you're never boujee

No, you never brand new, no it's never who's he

See I hate when I get recognized

And while the fan is hypnotized

I'm approached by random guys who feel the need to emphasize

""I don't know who you are""

I reply ""I'm a gentlemen and a fuckin' rap star""

Put your lighters in the sky if you got 'em

This for anybody that feel like they at the bottom

Nobody to tell 'em they special you know I got 'em

Nobody there to tell them they love them well I got 'em

No matter where you go you gotta persevere

Ain't no fuckin' around, and no makin' a sound you just got a murder to fear

Yeah I've been thinkin' about it tryin' to get out of it

Fuck what I'm thinkin' it's time to break out of it

Found myself in the thick and the debt of it

Had a bit and I knew murder son

And I murder again mother fuckin' critic I'm livin' my life

You ever wonder what it means to make it by any means and finally obtain your dreams

On the come up, but they run up in a world of many fiends

I been at it since a teen, get this money, get the cream

Hard work and sacrifice but not a lot know what it mean

Most these rappers, ain't got no class like bomb threats

And bein' the illest, the disease, is the on set

And it don't matter where you at

If you white, if you black, if you rich, or you poor, we gon' always want more

But one thing I can be sure, as long as I got the floor

I'm 'gon use this power to paint a picture of unity

Yeah I'm rippin' it up with that energy like there's two of me

Fuck the lights and the cameras, right now it's just you and me

I'll be richer than I was before

One day (one day)

I'm 'gon have enough money to buy the store

One day (one day)

It look like I'm at mass

Yeah, I'm comin' for that ass

Game has been broke into in so long, so it looks like I'm the cast

Like my section 8 crib, finally found some greener grass

So ahead of my time, I wasn't born in the past

This right here a double-header with Logic and Ryan Tedder

Oh no, it can't get no better

And you know– you know we do it for the children

I never thought I'd see the day I made a million

A couple thousand later, feel like everybody feel 'em

I ain't mean to boast in that last line

But counting moneys always been my favorite past time

Especially with a past like mine

Drugs in the household

Never had a hand to hold

Even when I was homeless in the blistering cold, but I made it out

And if I can, you can no doubt

I know



One day 

I'ma do it like I never did it

One day 

I'ma have the courage to go out and get it

One day 

Do what I love and support my girl (one day)

I'ma shake up the whole world

Aye yo, Wu-Tang forever

Who rhyme better?

We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever

R.I.P. O.D.B

Comin' through like Killa Bee

Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93

You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered

Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered

Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender

My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)

Yeah, we live and thorough

Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough

From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem, all the way to Maryland

Yeah, we comin' for all 'em

Bobby Tarantino to the Digital

My shit is pivotal

Smokin' chronic, no medicinal

Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?

The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone



Aye yo, Logic, what up? We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!

Guess who stepped in the room

It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more K

Intelligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes

Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase

Push weight, this Colgate

Tre-eights and old gates

Exfoliate those we most hate

We don't associate

We wear robes that you can't even pronounce-iate

We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate

Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates

Locations low-key, can't even locate

Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates

Tea makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates



Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades

It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge

57 MB, yo, metallic green

Seats is piped off

Seize them old tracks, unite through 'em

The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on

While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on

I'm known to wil' out, put the cams on

Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on

A specialist when I'm bakin'

Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'

We challengin' these chumps for lumps

Here's the statement stop hatin'

The crew is all about gettin' this cake in

You know about me, you relatin'



The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA

Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures

Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers and beer drinkers

Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers

Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin huggin' all four boroughs, puffin' herb with my cousin

Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'

I felt it comin' like the Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'

Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin

III-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten

The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted, diluted, broken down to a catastrophe

But cats still get good trophy

Hit y'all with their ""Okie-dokie""

Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddamnit

Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one

I got a light-beam gun

I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from

But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery

My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity

You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me

Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry



Old-school on this track, I feel invincible

This new school ain't really got rules and lacks the principles

Got mo' clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical

The gun, Smokey Robinson, you need a Miracle

Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical

When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminal

The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals

Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable We're the unpredictable, torture over your physical

Drop a bar, used to pour water over the cereal

Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual

But one Nation under God, that's indivisible

My time critical, hands-off from digital

Me and my lady bark, back when the Planets was Digable

I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that

I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on



It's only Logic, we got 'em mobber than the mosh pit

Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics

The hot shit I drop quick

Major player, watch my stock lift

Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what

Sound boy, turn that music up

Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up

Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy

Everything circulate back around eventually

Witty, unpredictable, talent all-natural

Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins

Twenty-five years, still more of the same

The flow like water with the boilin' flame

INS, your highness, they callin' my name

Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain

In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same

Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain



Survival of the fittest in cold days with no money

They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me

You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty

So I ain't down if you ain't talkin' that band language

Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it

An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it

But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it

I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it

Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it

We gave birth when we understood the pain with it

When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger

We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger

Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful

Another day in the life for us to be grateful

Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful

It's better to stay full, so let's make moves

I know your momma told you that I was a great dude

These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you

On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you

What? What? They might Crystal in the Lake you



Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off

Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off

Smoke and roast ya, the No.9 Potion

Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean

Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'

You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'

That's another level of emotion

Food stamps niggas doin' grocery

Police wanna grope me perp walk, then nigga street-talk

We bury niggas in see-saw

I carry the torch where I leave off

I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on

I rip off a shoulder to lean on

It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains

And none of my rhymes are two and the same

Nigga get cooked on an open flame

I'ma a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained



My rhyme starts riots in the mountains

Thirty-six million and countin'

The harder they come, the harder I go

Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?

Stay on my tip-toes, old-school, Wu B

This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'

Where I come from it stays snowin'

The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door

Beez bang bong in your jaw

I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor

Stars and bars, makes me a general

Anything less, makes me a criminal

Gotta dig deep for these Wu-Tang minerals



G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C

On the count of three, Wu-Tang

First, master your breathin'

I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when

I'm speakin' I'm a champion from Brooklyn

I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners

Avenger, a righteous defender

A grandmaster from the 36th Chamber

Whole style is mentally strong

So strengthen your arms

To hold my microphone you need iron palms

Remain calm, just mellow out

Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah



Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind

A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme

Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning Regardless, I speak logic, clear reasoning

The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz

Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts

A point-of-view of the thinkers

Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas



(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)

W.T.C., ah-ha

The faculty

Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move

Nobody slide, you might get hurt



En garde, I'll let you try my Wu tang style

I'd like to try your Wu tang style, let's begin, then

Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu tang sword style

If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous

My chain like a penguin's, Pellegrino (woo!)

We cold, we cold

Used to be in Lake Forrest with the Kobe fro

Eddie Bauer coat, Foams, and a load of dope

Boat load of white hoes I sold it to nigga

I was tryna survive, tryna survive

I was tryna survive, yeah, yeah

I was tryna provide, I was tryna survive

I put it down every time

Got some niggas alive, I got some niggas that not

Pour a little with brown liquor and look in the sky

Been the talk of the town, nigga, Virginia, Maryland

Did it all for the capital, hope you haven't forgot

Hoes love me a lot, niggas hate me a lil

Anybody can hear me for real give me their props

Hookin' up with a couple models, nobody's gon' try to play us

The motto is get your paper and make you a lot

Pulling up with the Young Sinatra, I'm looking like Sammy Davis

The MGM or the Vegas to shake up the rocks

And the Stadium poppin', the Palladium poppin'

It's a fifty a place nigga, she thinkin' about it

I'll be damned



And it's on now

Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)

Get in the zone now, (ohh, no, no, no)

(I'll be damned)

I said it's on now

Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)

Get in the zone now (ohh, no, no, no)



Everybody alive, everybody alive

Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive

Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe

Come on now, come on now

Come on now, you gotta survive

Everybody alive, everybody alive

Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive

Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe

Come on now, come on now

Come on now, you gotta survive

I said you gotta survive

Gotta survive, gotta survive

I said you gotta survive

Gotta survive, gotta survive

Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive



Goddammit, I'm back at it

Never outta breath like an asthmatic, I done had it

Feel this shit, I'm an addict, back in Maryland livin' in the attic

Flowin' erratic, bringin' the static, bustin' like an automatic

I'm badder than the baddest and madder than the maddest

My flow the fattest, hotter than a desert in Nevada

None other badder, fuck all the chitter and chatter, none of it matter

Pull the trigger and listen to the pitter and patter, let 'em shatter

'Cause I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin', the killer

The Ripper, he callin', we'll go and he'll flow and you know

He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it

Stoppin' it, rockin' it, talkin' it, walkin' it, flippin' it, rippin' it

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

With the gat, full clip
Out the blue, like a crip
Doin' 90 on the backroad outta nowhere my girl hit me
On the bat phone
I could hear it in her voice, no she just wasn't alone

Then a voice I didn't recognize

Said ""If you wanna' see your wife alive bring a million in cash and she's gonna survive""

Look at the clock, pitch black, it's 11:05

Hung up the phone you know I put that shit in Hyper-drive

Then I call my homie 6ix to tell him I'ma need his help

I'ma be outside in five get the gat under ya belt

Then I felt the sweat from my palm on the steering wheel

I tried to shake it, man, I can't believe this shit is real

Heart pumping on the 101

This shit right here ain't no fun

Live and die by the gun

Get you some

Yeah, I pull up to the crib, pick up 6ix, now we out this bitch

Only thing that's on my mind is ""Put this fucker in a ditch""

As soon as I get there, boy I'm lightin' up that ass I'ma fill him with lead

And they never finna count the cash 'til I look up at the dash and realize I'm out of gas

So I stop at the station

Piss like probation

Tell my boy to fill up as I head inside to pay

Open the door and see a white guy at the counter named Clay

Pull out the $50 and told him to hurry

He movin' slow, like he ain't got a worry in the world

And the attitude, maybe I was actin' rude

Hold up, if the person you love was kidnapped what would you do?

He saw my gat and my jacket and froze

I told him I ain't want no problem

But he chose to reach for the shotty anyway

So I blew him away

Just tryna get some gas now his brain blast (uh)

Frozen thinkin' about what just happened

Now it's in the past

Jump in the whip 0 to 60, yeah we out fast

See that red and blue flash, damn the cops is on my ass (*Sirens*)

Hear them sirens, flashing lights in my rear view

This shit like a movie in a theater near you

120 now, I feel like OJ

(The cops are gonna get us)

No they won't, everything'll be okay

Swerve left, swerve right

Now they almost out of sight

Finna pull under the bridge, they won't spot me here at night

Slow it down, play it cool

Mama she ain't raised no fool

Sit back breathe slow

(Holy shit) There they go

Man they found us

I don't know how but they came around us

Fuck the police, no they never do astound us

In the back of my mind I know I gotta get the cash, it's in my secret stash

Wish I had another path

Out the window I can hear the bullets blast, wish I had a mask (*Gunshots*)

Make it to the crib, that's my only task

Adrenaline in my body could take on anybody

Coming down to the wire, they blew my tire and then we flip



*Car crash*

Freeze you motherfucker! (*Gunshots*)

6ix come on get up!

I'm shot, I'm shot, what, I'm shot! (*Gunshots*)

Get the fuck on the ground!

Aww fuck

They got me

(*IV beep*)



He's bleeding slow, blood dripping from his torso

Will he ever get to see his son grow?

What's the picture they gon' paint after he go?

Last song he ever sung when the bullet hit his lung

Man I should've never called, he'd be alive if he ain't come

All he tried to do was help save my wife

Wish I could've saved his life

I wish I can take it back

Now my best friend's life curtain call fade to black

It just ain't no turning back

Pulled out the gat and put a bullet through the man

The blew in and came out his back

Jump in the whip, no looking back

First time in the front seat of that white and black

Side streets through the city, ain't nobody fucking with me

Yeah you know I had to duck 'em all

Screaming ""Motherfuck the law""

Next thing I saw was a block from my crib

Think about my shorty, she my rib

Pull up in the driveway

No cops in sight but might just somehow pull 'em my way

Open the stash, get the cash

Now I'm back out so I put the Audi in reverse and then I back out

Look at the addy in the text with my girl whereabouts

Five minutes later now I'm creeping in a warehouse

Lot of goons, lot of guns

Now I'm shooting just for fun

I don't give a fuck where they come from, I'm killing everyone

Finally make it to the back all alone pitch black

Hear a sound, what was that?

Think it came from over there

Lights on, now I see my wife she's tied up to a chair

With a gun to her head and a man gripping her hair

All I did was stop and stare

He took the gag out of her mouth and she started calling my name (Bobby!)

But didn't seem to be in pain, really shaken up (Bobby!)

I felt like I was waking up

So I shot him quick in the neck and he hit the floor

Before I untied her I shot him four more times

Put a bullet in his spine

Was he dead? let's see

Staring at the man, gun in his hand, it couldn't be

The man who kidnapped my wife was me



Bobby!

What?

Man get your ass up nigga, we at the studio

Say what?

Damn man. C'mon, hurry up man. What's wrong with you?

Wake up, here. Come on

Wait, we're at the studio right now? We're here already?

Damn man since you started smoking weed you always fucking late

Man shut the fuck up Kev

It's 3:38 PM

I’m going off, here we go



What up, what's good? I'm running through your hood

I'm feeling like I should, I wish a motherfucker would

Bobby be my name

I'm 'bout to run a train on this girl with all my boys and her name is Mary Jane

'Cause I burn big dope with my dogs

Joe Clay rolled a blunt so big this shit look like a log

In my dressing room but I can't see through all the fog

6ix supply the kicks like karate

I was fighting with the idea of smoking’ again

And now I got my green belt

And that’s the longest line without a rhyme

But the punch before the line about the line was so divine

For shizzle my nizzle I feel like D-O-double Gizzle on this grizzle my nizzle

Put the greenery on the grill and let it sizzle my nizzle

It don't matter the season Bobby let it burn when it drizzle

I won’t lie, I'll put my right hand on the Bible and tell the world that me and Berner got a strain of the cookie

That shit is just simply undeniable

It'll make your world shatter like glass

And I ain't talking bout the dabs

What’s the haps on the craps

(Hoo-ha)

Stoney Bob bring it back

Mary Jane, I never been the same since our lips locked

The only lady that never gets pissed off

And if there's one thing I know

It's how to roll a J and let it burn real slow

For those who don't know I go by Slaydro

Ready, set, go

I take one to the dome like Pablo Esco

Germinate the seed then just let it grow

Then harvest like a pro

Dodging cops just to cop digits

Made the packs move and flip like they was gymnasts

Got me seeing [?] green night vision

All truth, no fiction

Always fried like Popeye's Chicken

Hella mother hella motherfucker so you know I'm always know I'm always running late

Unless that currency at stake

In this Ruth Chris because I'm ruthless

Forty in the-forty in the trunk gone in 20 minutes

That's 80K for the ticket

Everybody-everybody fucking with it

Smoking the container bet I'm always gon' retain it

That's it



You make me feel so amazing

You make me feel so amazing

I wanna ride with you

I wanna smoke with you

I'm coming to get you

It ain't nothing, joint stuffing, rolling blunts and

Big buds for breakfast crumble like a muffin

No discussion, smoking big dope with the fam

Stoney on the bus, used to hot box a van

In and out the cites

Germanate the weed

All these male groupies stepping unless you got tree

Better roll it and smoke it to the last drop

That cash crop stay up in the hash spot

Daily session, that Buddha blessing, never stressing

Laid back but I keep the whistle like I'm reffing

That's some rap nigga Shit

We Hugh Heffin'

Smoke out the grado

Feeling like Pablo

Saucing like tomato

Pulling numbers like Lotto

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
How do you want to be remembered?
Being rich?



Visions of seeing my self as someone different

Reality got me feeling indifferent

I'm lifting this weight off my shoulders

But older, older I get

I reload the clip and sip on something

I feel good for nothing

All my glory days behind me or beyond me

I’m folding like origami

My tables turning like interior decorating

Levels like elevators

These haters got me questioning my judgement

Tried by a jury of my peers but where the judge went?

What will my legacy be?

Who will my enemy be?

In due time as I write this rhyme

I don't know

Flash before my eyes



And on my deathbed what will I say as I pray

And reminisce of another day

I came from nothing, a child born in poverty

Went to college to gain knowledge

So they would acknowledge me

Honestly, I got a good job

I found a woman made her my wife

But spent more time at work

So we could have a stable life

And when my son was born

I had to work even harder

Before I knew it now my wife was giving birth to my daughter

Went from 40 hours a week to 80

Ain't nobody gon’ pay me but myself

Sacrificing my time and health, for wealth

I missed a birthday, miss a anniversary

There's lots of people in this world that's worse than me

I wasn't there for my son's first words

But he ain't grow up in the hood like me, we in the burbs

Sacrifice a couple years, he can have all the money when I'm gone

What a fool I was, I missed his graduation, I missed her wedding day

I didn't even get to give my little girl away

But I paid for the honeymoon, yeah, I paid for the honeymoon

I’m not there right now but I will be later

I’m working on something that's greater

That’s my legacy

I'm gon' to be remembered by generations to come

Damn, you dumb

You won't be remembered by your son



To be remembered by generations to come

You a fool

You won’t be remembered by your son

Nonsense, nonsense

I said to the man with no money, nonsense

Step back who running from me I don't know my own identity

I look in the mirror, in the mirror, in the mirror, I ain't clearer

I'm just trying to be free, who is that, it surely ain't me

As I lay on my deathbed I realized I was wrong

I have been the richest man in the world all along

A beautiful family that all I did was ignore

For financial stability and fear of being poor

'Cause when I was a child knew I always wanted more

When I was a child knew I always

Wanted more, more, more

Now I got it

And now I'm laying in this bed, cancer spreading through my lungs

Looking at my family like ""damn, y'all were the ones

I sacrificed my life for 100's, 50's, 20's, 10's, 5's, and 1's""

So dumb, I'd give it all, if I could

Do it for my heart again, not my wallet

I hate to recall it but it's gone now legacy is gone now

Sacrifice my health for wealth no it wasn't worth it

But as I take my last breath I know that I deserved it



Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy

The Legacy you going to leave behind you forever

Is the blood in your veins wake up daddy now is the time for change and as your child I'm telling you I don't give a damn if we living on change daddy just as long as we livin', just as long as we livin' daddy, I just want to be happy I don't give a damn if we live in a shoebox

Now my mama going to tell you what you got



I love you, I love you, I love you I want you I need you I crave you

Why you throw away this pussy that I gave you

Why you fucking around behind my back

While I'm home raising my children

Feel like a single mother even though a ring up on it

Supposed to be husband and wife you more like my opponent

Finger fucking myself because fucking fidelity

I'd rather look in the mirror be happy who I see

Sometimes I want to take my babies and go to my mama crib

Can I live?

Can I have a life away from my life

Be the woman that I would have been if I wasn't your wife

You know I love them but if that test wasn't positive

I would have had a lot to give

Sometimes I want to divorce your ass and take half, motherfucker

But I stay 'cause I love these children

And I love you deep down, that's why I stick around, but

You never there because you just want to be the best

You just want to make this money

Come get this pussy motherfucker

Come get this pussy and love your children

Fuck your legacy

Fuck it



Float in the abyss of nothingness my consciousness remembers a life before it hits black

I wish I could get back and then I realize that all this shit is just a daydream and there's only like four of us in a tour bus and I'm in the back, how about that?

Thinkin' about my legacy

And how we as human beings sacrifice health for money

Ain't it funny?

'Cause in the end we spend all our money on repairing our body and mind when we really should have just spent time

Fuck a legacy

I'mma go live my life

This shit right here on the real, I can't get enough

God damn, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' man

Went from gettin' close to the gang

To sipping champagne on a plane

Do what you love in life and never second guess it

Even when haters protest it now

You ever wonder what it means to

You ever wonder what it, uh

You ever wonder what it means to finally limit your dreams

Then realize that everything, it just ain't what it seems

Uh, yeah, I thought I wanted to be the greatest alive

Until I realized that being the greatest is just a lie

Like the opening words in this verse

That as soon as they disperse make other rappers converse

I'm glad to put in you a hearse, real talk fuck rap

I hate and I love it 'cause it's so negative

Everybody selfish, nobody wanna give

A helping hand to the next man, well fuck you then

As soon as you played me this joint I already knew
Yo this some fucking, Last Call shit
And it got me hella excited 'cause I always wanted to do like
A Last Call, I remember the first time I heard Kanye's
I thought that shit was so tight dawg

I was like, man I'm tryna tell my story, you know what I'm sayin'

And then uh, I remember Cole did it, when did he do it?

He was on Friday Night Lights?

Nah nah, he did it on The Warm Up yo

When he did the Last Call on the warmup I was like ""Damn I'm tryna do mine

So since this joint got that vibe I'ma do my own Last Call right now for y'all

And my voice is messed up too, this is the last track of Young Sinatra



Yeah, yeah

Back in the day I wasn't shit, homie

Penny pinching I couldn't even pay the rent, homie

Thinkin' 'bout it I'm wondering where the years went, homie

Just a youngin' tryna survive, they was hatin' on me

I was working that nine-to-five, I was waitin' homie

I was bussin' tables fantasizin' 'bout cakin' homie

Letting them slip away, my dreams wasn't waitin' on me

This for anyone with ambition, calling anybody that'll listen

I'm wishing all your dreams come true, 'cause mine did

And yeah, you know I had to put that in the rhyme kit

But that shit came from sacrifice

Not on the corner selling drugs and smackin' dice (listen)

Yeah



Someway somehow, I understood still finally

If you want to come and get it you know where to find me

'Cause I don't got no time for anyone that be tryin' me

Know if they don't understand I'ma leave 'em behind me

I'll be asleep

I ain't got no time, no no

I said I'll be asleep

I said I don't got no time, no, no, no



Yeah, yeah

I treat the beat like it's my only son, my DNA

And this that southern playeristic shit like we was in the A

Back in the day, I was young, broke and infamous

A Young Sinatra that was undeniable

Who welcomed you to forever while Under Pressure

And told you The Incredible True Story of Bobby Tarantino

And Everybody in the Ultra 85

Goddamn it feel good to be alive

And all these bitches that I passed up

Couldn't fuck witcha 'cause your hair was too gassed up

'Member creeping with the gat, masked up



Goddamn it's kinda crazy to reminisce on all this shit man

What it was like growing up. Damn man, just, motherfuckers running in and out of the crib, doing drugs, selling drugs, all types of stuff. Meanwhile, I was just tryna keep it together, I was tryna make sense-sense of all this shit around me, I didn't know how to take it, how to perceive it, you know what I mean. And then meanwhile I'm supposed to be going to school and getting good grades and shit, but I'm seeing like, domestic violence in my house, and just, so much going on. And I'm sure everybody was probably like, damn, yo



""Why little Bobby didn't come to school today?""

On the real, I was doin' anything to run away

And that's the same reason kids join gangs every day

'Cause they wanna be accepted, but at home they too neglected

Meanwhile, white america quick to call him a thug

But all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love

Tell him that he love him, that he need him

Promise he won't ever leave him

Never smoke crack, never lie, and he'll never beat him

I feel like all my life I been needing a break

Looking at my family, I ain't wanna make the same mistake

And I know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin' great

Oh God please, can I have a conversation with 'em?

Member of my family without they hand out asking for five G's

To pay they bills or they lawyer fees (huh)

I learned something, I ain't giving y'all a dime

I'll give you something worth more, that's my time

I ain't dropping stacks, I'm dropping knowledge

Unless it's for my nieces and nephews to go to college

And hit me on the phone, hit me up

Like ""Uncle Bob, where you at?

Yeah I know your pockets fat but I don't give a fuck 'bout that

I'm glad we family"" (uh)

We a half breed family, yeah, yeah, uh



Man see I remember when I was like fifteen years old and my dad took me to the studio--I know this is random I'm just trying to take you guys through it, right. And, I'll never forget it I had like eight rhyme books--he'll tell you, he'll tell you man, I just, I went through them motherfuckers I was rapping for like fifteen minutes straight. And that was my first time yo, I was like tenth grade, in the studio, and I knew that this was what I wanted to do. I knew it



I knew it ever since I first saw Kill Bill

I been flowin' like that blood, Uma Thurman spill

None other than the RZA, yeah he did the soundtrack

And then I discovered Wu-Tang soon as I found that

And then Big L, Mos Def, and Nas, there ain't no turning back

Couldn't change it if I tried, homie, how 'bout that

See I'm a student of the game, so simple and plain

But I'ma to take it back to before I ever sat first class on a plane



I was in College Park, right. Well I guess technically, if you wanna go before that, I was uh, I was living in Germantown, uh no actually it was in Montgomery Village, back in Maryland I was living in my sister's basement. And some shit happened, you know, she kicked me out, it was Christmas, whatever I love you Genie. Anyway, so shit happened, and then I just kept it pushing. You know, I was homeless for a little while, whatever, you know, I went, uh, I stayed at my mentor's house, Solomon, and I stayed back at my Godparent's house, Mary Jo and Bernie, I love ya'll. Uh, Mary Jo, I'm sorry back when I used to smoke, I would steal the shit out of your cigarettes, I love you, I'm sorry about that. But, you remember, always you would let me record, I'd always be recording in the attic or wherever I could so, I love you, I thank you for supporting me there. But then, she was like, ""you gotta get the fuck outta here"" too, after a while, she gave me some time, but like, I was twenty years old at this point. She was like, ""nah, you gotta get the fuck outta here and do something with your life."" And this was right around the time I opened my first show ever for Ghostface Killah man, in Gaithersburg, right in Old Town, the shit was insane, I'll never forget it, and that's where I met my boy Lenny, Big Lenbo, wassup! That's right man, we just started kicking it and hanging, he lived in College park and before I, before I knew it I was living with him in his basement. And this is right around the time I met 6ix, and 6ix was going to the University of Maryland at the time, which is right down the street. So I'd always go to their dorm room, I remember there was nights I would just crash in the dorm when we was making beats. We was doing all types of shit man, when we first got out we did the first Young Sinatra, and now we on the fourth Young Sinatra motherfucker that shit is crazy man. And I remember like, I used to steal quarters from Lenny just so I could go to the 7-11 to eat and he was like, ""you idiot why are you stealing, just ask me bro,"" and I was supposed to get a job, I was sleeping in, uh, his basement on the couch, which is the cover to my first album, Under Pressure, shout out Cathy, shout out the Rosado family, all my beautiful brown people! We made it, it's crazy, but nah nah, listen, I'm getting ahead of myself, I'm getting ahead of myself. So like, I was staying with him and I was supposed to get a job, right? And he was like, ""Yo, you gotta get a fucking job bro."" Things were going so good with the music that we kinda stopped talking about it, it seemed like every week something new was happening, and I just sat him down one day and I was like, ""Look bro, please, like, can you just give me one year, like just give me one year, man, let me put everything into that year. And if I don't get it, fuck it, I'll just submit, and I'll just blend into society."" And he was like, ""Bro I'ma give you one year,"" and for one year him, his family, all his homies, Benny, everybody man! They took care of me, they put, he put clothes on my back, he put food in my stomach, you know he helped me with microphones, and recording, and yo, almost a year to the fucking day bro, I signed to Def Jam. And my man, he was a land surveyor, out there making sure all the buildings get built, rain, snow, sleet, all that shit for twelve years dawg! And when I signed my deal I said, ""Fuck that! Quit your job, we're moving to LA!"" That shit was crazy, so we get to LA, we're staying off Coldwater Canyon. Alta Mesa, in studio city man, and I'm going to the studio with No I.D. every day, and like, shit is crazy. That's the first time I met Cole, yo shout out Cole, that's my fucking boy. Big Sean, all these homies man that I met, it was crazy, Don Cannon, everybody. That's when I first met Kev, Bobby my engineer, what up Bobby? It was just like, life was insane. I dropped Young Sinatra Undeniable, and that was crazy, that was insane, 'cause that was the first time



Me and my boys ever hit the road

On the real you know we went from zero to overload

Performing in front of the fans, they had their hands waving

This is all I ever wanted, this is all I'm craving

Me and my boy Chris shot the game

Two visionaries on a mission, shit ain't been the same

Some ups and downs came around, had a lot of problems

But no matter what happened you know we always solve 'em

We always solve 'em, like



Man, it's kinda crazy thinking about it though. Like so much has happened yo, and I mean shit, by the time y'all are hearing this, I'm 28, I'm 27 while I'm recording it. I mean right now literally I'm working on Bobby Tarantino, Ultra 85, Young Sinatra 4, and a whole bunch of other shit, man this is crazy! Acting, writing, like I'm just so, I can't believe I'm here man, we grinded for so long, we worked for so long, yo. And motherfuckers they hate you man, they try to make me feel bad about how I look, how I speak, how I rap, how I act, my race, my everything, they just, they fucking hate you man, they'll hate you when you in this position. But you can't let 'em, you can't let 'em, you can't let that shit get to you man. Continue to persevere, continue to be the best you you can be, 'cause I'm here right now man, best friends. I got everything I could ever want man, even though you always want more deep down, and you got goals deep down, that's great, but fuck that shit, I'm so happy, I'm so blessed man. So if you listening to this right now, no matter how old you are, how young you are, whether you on a school bus headed to get your education, or you driving home from work pissed off at your boss, just man, just please do what you love in life. So many people, they always say, ""Oh I would do this but,"" or ""I can't because,"" and you already fucking lost, they lost, and I felt bad for that person 'cause that person will never make it. ""I would, but I don't have the money,"" ""I would, but I don't have the time,"" Fuck that, you gotta do it man, you gotta do what makes you happy, you have to live selfishly in that aspect. Stop worrying about others, stop freaking out, just focus on yourself man, and your own happiness, that's the realest thing. And that's all I can tell you, because you can't help anyone else until you help yourself, you know what I'm saying. So please, put the mask on first, like they say on the airplane, cus', put your own motherfucking mask on, and go do it man. Go do it, just live your life



I love y'all, thank you so much for tuning in, uh, I hope you've enjoyed this Young Sinatra experience, I know I have. Uh, this is prolly gon' be the last one tho, uh, this gon' be the last one for sure. I'm coming back with some fun, but, I don't know. I love you guys! Ultra 85's gonna be crazy! I mean crazy! Bobby Tarantino's that trap shit, whoo! We took 'em back with this boom bap, now we finna head to the future, we ain't scared, we make music for everybody, you know what I mean? I love you, look at that Murrland accent coming out. I don't know why, every time I get on the mic that Murrland accent, go ahead cuh, job like all day boy, you sound like Wale, back of your neck. I love y'all so much. RattPack, yeah, yeah. Yeah!"

Rick: Well, Morty, that entirely depends on whether or not you have the mental capacity to pick something I would be willing to listen to
Morty: Well, what about Logic?
Rick: Logic?
Morty: You're not fuckin' with Logic? Bro? You know what I'm talkin' about?
Rick: Morty, calm down, of course, I love Logic. Who doesn't like Logic? You gotta be a fuckin' idiot if you don't like Logic. But the question is, what ""Logic"" are we talkin' about here?

Morty: What do you mean?

Rick: Well are we talkin' about mixtape Logic or album Logic?

Morty: What does it matter? I mean Logic is Logic

Rick: Morty, it matters very much

Morty: I don't know, Rick, I mean... album Logic?

Rick: Ugh, Morty I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to decline your request

Morty: What? Grandpa Rick, are you saying you don't like Logic albums?

Rick: Morty, if that's what I was trying to say, I would have said it. Don't come at me like a little punk ass motherfucker, don't try to come at me, Morty. I'm saying that he's got a plethora of music that varies from mood to mood, Morty. Okay? And I'm saying that I'm in the mood to turn some shit up, Morty. I'm not in the mood for a message about how I can be whatever I want or oohhh equality and everybody and all that shit, alright? Just wanna hear some fuckin'... about titties, throwin' stacks on some ass, you know, just some good old fuckin' ATL style club rap, Morty

Morty: Geez, Rick, I mean, Logic he turns stuff up on his albums too, Rick, you know? He turns shit up

Rick: Morty, shut up. I'm simply implying, you know, I want some shit I can turn up on this ride to Clazabar planet in sector G9, okay

Morty: Alright, geez, okay

Rick: So, you know, so, meet me in the middle, Morty. Give me some of that Bobby Tarantino shit. You're talking about Logic, you know and I'm talking about that titty rap. Jus- why don't we meet in the middle with some Bobby Tarantino, you know. I need it, just need to hear it, it's pretty good

Morty: Yeah, you know I agree with you Rick, here I'm gonna throw this Bobby Tarantino shit in

Rick: Yeah, drop that shit, drop that shit, Morty! Drop that shit in my fucking spaceship, Spaceship!

Peace, Love, and Positivity that's all I want with you

But you push the issue 'cause I give you more press than your publicist could ever get you

Hell nah, fuck rap, fuck beef, anyone that hate me, I wish you success

I wish you look in the mirror and ask yourself why you surpressed

If feelings of self-hatred that you wan' project on me

Bet if I never picked up the mic then we might be homies

But you jealous, you look at my life and you feel envy

Constantly comparing yourself to me and feel empty

Most people that don't fuck with me ain't ever shook my hand

I'm a good man, yeah, I love myself

I know who I am, yeah, I love myself

They don't understand, but no matter what happen you know that–



Can't nothing stop me, I'm on a roll

Always on time 'cause my eyes is on my Rollie-olex

I don't trust nobody, oh no (no, no, no!)

I don't trust nobody, put my homies on the payroll

Fuck with me now or you'll never know (never know!)

If you weren't with me in the beginning you get no love

My name Bobby Tarantino (Tarantino!)

Hi! It's uh–Logic, hi, sorry. It's Elton John calling you, um. I hope you don't mind me getting you on your mobile–or not getting on your mobile, but I was just, uh–congratulating you first of all on your performance at the Grammys and then I was asking you–I was gonna ask you if you'd like to do something for me, and I will ring you back later and see–and talk about it, thanks!"

And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping

Man I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past

It don't even come to my house if it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag

We roll up the herb and laugh

Kick back, blowing zip

Take it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip

Niggas like me always got weed on 'em

Try to tell me that she don't smoke later on she joinin'

In the point, keep going in

Fuck a pill, only numb the pain

You know how much that shit cost?

I ain't talking 'bout your pocket, no I am only talking about the mind

When the cannabis combine with the brain it be like everything you seen you seen the shine

Smoking that golden state, everything going great

Got a lot on my plate

Lotta city of complaints

Stacking money in the bank

This that RATTPACK and that Taylor Gang

They know the face and they know the name

I'm a married man with a bad wife

Never fuck around unless it's Mary Jane

What's the last thing you remember, Atom?

I was in the store, I bought some smokes

I came outside, the phone rang, I...

How do you know my name?!

You were walking home from work when you died

Died? Dead? I'm dead? I'm dead?!

It wasn't an act of courage or bravery, but it was your time

What do you mean it's my time? What? I got...

What about Vanessa? What about the baby?

Your wife and son? You see, that's what I like to hear

You find out you're dead and the first thing you worry about is others

Man, answer me, what about my family?

What's going on with Vanessa?

They're doing just fine

You see, your wife was cheating on you

Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!

And even though she loved you dearly

She was a bit relieved you would never find out

Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?

How you gon' tell me I'm dead then gon' tell me my wife cheated on me?!

Atom, none of that matters now

Walk with me

Wait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?

No

Well, I don't see no pitchforks

Little red people runnin' around

It ain't too hot up in here so I guess this ain't hell either

I think the easiest way to describe it, this white void

Is to look upon it as a waiting room

So...are you God?

Yes, I'm God"

Part of me you love more than to let it go



Dear God, I just wanna know why

Why do you put us here?

Why do you put us below?

Why do you put us subservient?

Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers?

And then we crawl and we scratch our way out

We betray each other

We lie, we take from one another

And we told you gon' forgive us at the end

But the state don't forgive us

I'm locked up and half my friends

And then when I get out, or I make it out

I'm expected to somehow give back

To people who never wanted to see me escape

I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror

And it's gettin' clearer

That society was designed to keep me on the bottom

So, if you real, if you're out there for real

Please explain to me why

Why do we suffer? Why do we die?

And why do the people

Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead?

I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right

But tonight, I am in this church

Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me

Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do

So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down

I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up

I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame

And all I wanna do is believe in you

The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt

And they make sure it hurts

And I am tired of hurtin', man

I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared

So if you out there, do something about this

Take it back, take it way back, take it way way back to about 1990

Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland

7:36am. Where a biracial baby was born

To a black father and a white mother

Father that wasn't there, addicted to crack cocaine, Alcohol, and various other drugs

Same as his mom

Way, way back

So I'm gonna tell you about that, I'm gonna tell you about how

All this young boy ever wanted was Happiness

All he ever wanted was positivity

All he ever wanted to do was entertain

And this boy went through hell

You gotta understand, his mother was racist

Which is crazy

Because how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men But you racist

Like bitch, that don't make no sense

But it is what it is

You know, he grew up, her callin him a nigga

The kids at school callin him a cracker

Identifying as black, looking as white

Being told what you can or can't be

This kid went through everything

He went through...

He saw narcotics in the household

He saw violence, murderers, drug dealers

He was kidnapped, there was crazy shit that happened to this kid

And he persevered while the whole world said

What they said?

Said you wouldn't be shit!

You ain't gon be nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin

And I, and he, he said fuck that, I'ma persevere

And that's why the message is always peace, love and positivity

And see, he always saw things from two sides

He always saw things from two sides

He always knew that the message

Everybody, was born equal

Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation

He knew that because he saw that

Because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters

That were uneducated and that did not know

And he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know

These people that are ignorant, that cannot see the bigger picture

That must fight, and kill, and murder each other

But once again, all he ever wanted to do

Was spread a message

Of equality, for every man, woman, and child

Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation

Now imagine this child growing up

And seeing the craziest shit

Being a part of the craziest shit

Running around with the wrong people

Running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and

All this, because he didn't know, he didn't know!

But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn't right

And he knew that he needed to get away from it

Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old

This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself

Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings

And then he would then come home to about 8 or 9 hours of sleep

But spend 4, 5, 6 hours of that working on music, persevering

Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror

And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people

Just chanting his name

Hoping that it would happen

But the, but the, but the world said No!

Mothafucka, little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no

Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka

No no!

And he said fuck that

He said peace, love, and positivity

He said equality for all man

Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation

Yeah

Now I also want you to imagine people telling him that he did not live this life

You just a white boy. You ain't never experienced that shit.

You from Gaithersburg, Maryland. Nothing happens there.

Oh no, no, we no, we weren't there, we didn't live with you, in your Section 8 household. We didn't live with the narcotics and violence in your household. We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside. And since you white, you gotta have money, right?

And this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was, wasn't, and would

Never be

And that man is here today, proud

A lover of all human beings

Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation

Yeah, yeah

And he's here to say:

Even though we're all born and created equal

We are not treated equally

There's extremists on every side

And you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe

As long as they're not hurtin anybody

You can believe they're going to hell

You can believe it's not right

You can believe you're superior, fine

Just stop killing each other"

I know some people wish I'd act white instead

Say I'd use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead

Fuck that everything I do I do it right

To teach the people that they have the power to fight

And not with semi automatic bullets in the night

So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact

Nobody treated equally, especially the black

If you don't get it the first time, bring it back

Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights

Cuz the richest people in the whole world equal whites

To make it happen though we gon need patience

And not violence giving hospitals more patients, now

Don't burn down the mom and pop shop!

Don't be angry at the color of they skin

Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and

Atom: What the fuck you mean if that's what I wanna call it? either this is what it is, or this is



What it ain't

God: Sure

Atom: Chu mean? Ughhh, this muhfucka (Atom sighs in frustration)

Atom: Aight, lemme get this straight, every time I die, I come here, we talk, and you send me back to earth to be reborn?

God: You know the last time we had this conversation it was in mandarin and you were 13 Atom: Mandarin?

God: And a girl!

Atom: What? Nah, bruh, you fuckin wit me. You're... Like, Jesus Christ

God: he was here too!

Atom: What? Wait, wait, so the Christians got it right?

God: Well I'm about to reincarnate you Atom. I'd say everyone kinda got it right

Atom: This is a whole lot to take in!

God: I know trust me, I've been there

Atom: Sooooooo, how many times have I been reincarnated?

God: Many, many many many, MANY times

Atom: If it's so many times, why don't I remember?

God: If we stayed here long enough, the lives you have lived, and the knowledge from each of them would return

Atom: What?

God: I'm actually about to send you back to 1736 as Bryan Fairfax, the 8th lord Fairfax of Cameron

Atom: God damn!...oh, I'm sorry

Atom: Well at least I'm not poor no more

God: Well sure! with all that land and the hundreds of slaves you'll own

Atom: Slaves!?!? Aw hell nah, nononono, look look look: how you gonna take a black man, send him back in time, and now I gotta own slaves?

God: Well if it's any consolation, your son Tom, the 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron sets them free!

Atom: No! That does not make me feel better at all

Atom: Wait hold up, I just realized... you said you're gonna send me back in time?

God: Well, I'm not really sending you back in time. that doesn't exist where I come from, only in your universe

Atom: Well, where are you from?

God: Honestly Atom, even if I explained where I came from, or told you about the others like me, you just wouldn't understand

Atom: But if there's others like you, how can you be god?

God: Atom, I said you wouldn't understand!

Atom: So what's the point of doing all this?

God: Really?

Atom: What?

God: A little cliche don't you think? Essentially asking Me the meaning of life (God says with a chuckle)

Atom: Well I figured I would ask before you send me back and I can't remember none of this. God: Atom come here. the meaning of life... the reason I created this place...is so that you can grow, and mature

Atom: Like the human race? Like this is how the human race is supposed to grow and mature? mature into what? We can't even get along

(god interrupts)

God: No Atom, you! It's for you, YOU to mature

Atom: I don't understand

God: I created this place for you, Atom. This entire place was made for you. Every time I send you back, every life you live, you grow, and mature and understand the grand meaning behind all of this just a little more each time

Atom: Just me? Wait, what about everybody else?

God: Atom, there is no one else

Atom: I don't understand

God: Atom, you are every human being who has ever existed since the dawn of your kind on earth

Atom: Wait I'M EVERYONE!?!?!

God: Aaahhhhh yes, now you are beginning to see it

Atom: So I'm like, everyone that ever existed on earth, ever?

God: EARTH? Ha, that's cute. Earth was just YOUR birthplace. Let us not forget all the stars humanity will colonize over the millennia

Atom: Wait, that is so much. Too much to take in! I'm every human being that ever lived?

God: Or ever will live, yes!

Atom: I'm Jesus?

God: And all of his disciples

Atom: I'm Hitler!?!?

God: And the millions he murdered

Atom: That's deep

God: You see Atom, every act of hatred and violence you committed against another, you were committing against yourself and every act of love and hand of kindness, you also extended unto yourself

Atom: God, why do all this?

God: Someday, long from now, you will become like me. You will mature to become what I am. Atom: I'm a god?

God: (chuckles) No, not yet. you see, I was once where you stand right now...it is not until you have lived every human life inside of your universe that I may take you from this place. Once you have walked in the shoes of every race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, loving and hateful person, it is only then that you will understand how precious life truly is"

It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood

I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars

When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic

As my body began to fade

In this moment my mind was full of clarity

But my body insisted it was in danger

I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine

But I was convinced that something was wrong

Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to

Fall and fade away

My body grew weak

And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went thru was anxiety

I refused to believe this story

I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me

I began to feel detached from reality

I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass

I got blood work done

Analysis of my mind and body to no avail

The doctor said it was anxiety

But how could it be anxiety?

How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?

How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?

Derealization

The sense of being out of one's body

I'm not here

I'm not me

I'm not real

Nothing is

Nothing but this feeling of panic

Nobody understands

Nobody knows the sufferings

This physical feeling

It can't be anxiety

It can't

Or can it?

Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?

Yeah, of course

I'm so in control of my mind and my body

But I'm subconsciously forcing myself into a state

Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind

I am unhappy

Not with life

But with this feeling

I am scared, I am human, I am a man

But I look in the mirror and I see a child

I am an adult who recognize grown ups don't really know shit

And they never did

And it scares me

Cause now I'm just a grown up who doesn't know shit

But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me

No, no this feeling

This anxiety is nothing

I have anxiety

Just like you, the person I wrote this for

And together we will overcome this feeling

We will remember despite the attacks and constant filling of our mind and body being on the edge

That we are alive

And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted

We will rejoice in this gift that is life

We will rejoice in this day that we have been given

We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves

Starting with mental health

We will accept ourselves as we are and we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror We will accept ourselves

And live with anxiety"

And how the world gonna treat her

How could her momma mislead her

And her daddy just leave her?

Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever

Oh my



Oh my, my, my, my, my

Ohhh

Oh my, my, my, my, my

Oh my

I don't feel right deep inside

Feeling like I need to hide

Everybody wonder why I get high

Cause I can't fight the feeling inside

Oh my, my, my

Oh my, I said oh my



Sometimes I can't get you out of my mind

Baby, no I just can't find, I just can't find

Such a beautiful state of mind

Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind

Beautiful state of mind

Sometimes everyday right on time

But right now in my mind

It feels like I'm living on borrowed time



I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood

Been looking for holy water, now I'm praying for a flood

It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug

While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a...

Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?

Tell me you love me, need me

Promise me you'll never leave me

Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street

With a fist to match, more solid than con...

Tell white people I'm black, feel the need to retreat

Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik

But my beautiful black brothers and sisters

Want to act like I'm adopted

Go back in time to when my nigga daddy

Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

My oh my, oh my

Feeling innocent, oh my

Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence

And all this shit is so intense

Don't wanna go to this event

Just wanna stay home and invent

And somehow, yeah, that let me vent

I'm taking shots and drinking liquor

But that shit don't make a dent in how I'm feeling

And yes I'm willing to keep chilling on this shit

I know there's someone out there far away

Who's feeling all this shit

And yes I know that when I'm low

There's so much further I can go

And so I look up to the sky, to the sky

Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida

Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her

Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her

Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her

All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater

Wondering what's gonna happen

And how the world gonna treat her

How could her momma mislead her

And her daddy just leave her?

Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever

How could her momma mislead her

And her daddy just leave her?

Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever

How could her momma mislead her

And her daddy just leave her?

Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever

How could her momma mislead her

And her daddy just leave her?

Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever

How could her momma mislead her

And her daddy just leave her?

Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever

Oh my



So what now?

What advice can you give me ?

What advice can I give humanity?

I suppose so

Live your life

Don't waste your days on the negative energy of others

Remember that you're not your salary

You're not your house you're not your car

And no matter how big your bank account is

Your grave is six feet under just like everyone else's

So enjoy the days you have

Worry not bout the days that came before you

Nor the ones that will follow you in death

Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed

And the fact that you are living is what life is all about

So live your life to the fullest

According to your happiness and the betterment of all

Damn man, we've been walking forever

Well, Thalias tracking system says we'll be there in just over an hour

Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?

Oh no, man

I'm cueing up the fourth album now, his final one



One, two, three, four

One, two, three, four, listen

Look into my eyes

Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on

This front that I'm puttin' up for you

I spill my soul into a microphone

With poems written in blood

In hopes that it's enough for you

Do you love me yet?

Do you love me yet?

No? Okay

I'll go harder for you

In fact, I rap till I collapse

All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson

I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own

Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed

About the ways to raise a child up

To not become a product

Of his environment, I need to cry and vent

But I done built this wall up

Actin' like everything's all good

But in reality I'm lookin' for something

Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after

Nas, Cole, and Hov

Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'

I'm used to being alone

Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?

Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne

One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along

Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant

Boosting my ego with every million that spills in

And still then

I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?

Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap

When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved

By parents that was in too deep with the drugs

Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit

Be who you are, identify as a star

No one tells you you're that

It's something that you just know

The world be stealing your glow

Your mama did what she could

Her life was miles from good

Your father fell in the trap

They set for you when you black

They met when they was low

And therefore you a product of that

And so your trauma is deep

Don't bury it you should weep

And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em

Just my opinion, only then can you find peace

Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release

I've been through it before

Can only share with you what I know

To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you

And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try

This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly

The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky

But if you want to then you ought to know why

Are you running from something

With hopes of becoming someone

That's finally worthy of love

Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough

Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell

Find God, learn to accept yourself

And I'm gone, accept Him"

I say oh my



I feel the Arian in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood

Been looking for holy water now I'm prayin' for a flood

Feel like time passing me by, slower than a slug

While this feelin' inside of my body's feelin' like a rug

You can hug me, rub me on the back like a child

Tell me you love me, need me, promise me you'll never leave me



Wait a minute, is that?

Ayy, who's all in there? You playin' that?

We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit

It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged

No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same

The incredible album, what an incredible outcome

I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm

I used to think the fame and money was the motivation

Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and

Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement

It ain't about the money and notoriety

It's about the people and making a difference in society

But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie

The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding an Uzi

One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?

Same level, the same rebel that never settled

Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto

And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered

Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me

Different stances

I used to spend all my time conversing with you

But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you

Shit is too big, but let's be honest man,

It's kinda bittersweet, besides the shows and meet and greets y'all only see me on the street

And even then, that shit is rareI just don't go outside

Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide

That misconception, ""Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride""

Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied

People in my ear telling me, ""Talk that shit""

Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit

Since the first album

I'm one of the highest earners on the label

Within six months I put the second one on they table

I've played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce

Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce

Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now

Let me just bounce

The mood around me is people smokin' that by the ounce

Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand

Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand

You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand

Cause people don't buy music in this day and age

They buy the brand

There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong

But back when I ain't have shit

Felt like I would've sold my soul to make it with this rap shit

Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask

Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass

Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?

At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that Champagne

If I could live forever and a day

Know I'd never fade away

But my life is not okay, I...

I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed

Life is fucking up my vibe, I...

I wish had a lot of money

Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper you already know

My life would be so much better with cheddar

Only work as hard as I do for vendetta

Cause my 9th grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit

Wouldn't be nothing

Working that minimum wage and cooking McMuffins

So I'm puffing on this green

Wishing I had more money than I do

Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, ah!

And so I'm all about my business

Is there anyone who witness?

Can a brother get a witness like...

AhOoh, AhOoh

Wassup with it come and get it

Tell me now what's on your mind

I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline

Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine

Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line

Somebody tell me now what done happen to society

My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety

They say that money cannot make you happy

Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke

And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?

Why you trying me?

Like ahh...



Now I'mma tell 'em what makes me happy

This what makes me happy, right here

Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone

Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing

But I'm testing, reminiscing when I would listen to my intuition

And now I made it, resurrecting, Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated

It seem like everyone's somehow related

Letters back and forth from my homie that's locked up in prison

Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him

I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man

I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in

What if the tables was turned and I was the one that been in, damn

He said he's seen me in the magazine

He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel

That's been my dog from the kennel

I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one

It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun

Skipping class with all of my homies, on a constant search for who I was

I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because

My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs

I never graduated but I made it to the summit

Don't get me wrong, so many times I thought that I would plummet

Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem to stomach

All of the beef around my way

I mean, I never wanted to live a life where all you're truly living is a lie

I knew I always wanted more and so they wonder why

I said they wonder why



This is our time

Still I'm looking back

Let me rewind

This is our ride

Don't let me lose my faith

Let me rewind



So what do you think about space

Um, space is called the galaxy

Do you know planets? What are- can you name some planets off?

Yeah, there's a one named Saturn and Earth, Mars and the planet Paradise

You've never been there before?

Um, no. I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in a coolest ship. My TV showed us where we are in space. But there was droid ships everywhere

Well, thank you for your time, sir. I appreciate the interview"

If I was underground before then this is me in my attic

For this rap shit I'm an addict

But can't fuck with that dramatic

I've been busting my ass

They probably think it's automatic

Yes sir I've done this shit before like your baby momma momma

Imma tell 'em like it is, Imma tell 'em like it is

Life isn't picture perfect

We use the negatives to develop

I'm well up I'm way up

Nothing but net, fuck the layup, I'm way up

Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions

Can't fuck with they delusions

I'm on that 101 cruisin'

Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way

But no not quite like this live it like that

In a way yes you could say

Made me wanna write like this

Not quite like this on my level

I'm unique and I'm a rebel

Are you listening

I hope that you're listening

This feel like it's summertime

Waiting for the bus number nine

Through the city all alone

Not a worry, not your phone

We just vibing maybe flying 'round the world

Man, I hope you see the world

And all your dreams will unfurl

Just don't never cash your pearl

Much love to Def Jam, even though they undershipped me

Did me like Bobby did Whitney but the fans was with me

Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me

All the talent in the world and they still don't get me

I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album

But black vs white bullshit was the still the outcome

How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go

Judging rap by race instead of the better flow

Who gives a fuck who made it, I penetrated and innovated

While they emulated, give a fuck if I'm hated

I'mma do it til I get it, fuck a nominated

Bitch I dominate it

Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID

Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E

Not many get to what I do by any means

Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me

But let's get back to the music, I'm gone

Outside of this solar system I'm searching for paradise

Livin' the life, bitch I've been a vet

Fuck all these cats on the internet

I love Hip Hop and I hate Hip Hop

Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot

Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sake

Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break

Now I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game

We all people, all equal

Now let me let off, yeah

Now let me let off

Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify

Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by

Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones

Black on one side, now I'm in another zone

Switch flows, fuck 'em up

Play the game, run 'em up

Yeah I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck

All the people want is real

Guess that's why Logic appeal

All the power in the world, hold that, tell me how it feel

Racism on television and in magazines

Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn

Country don't give a fuck who I am

Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand

And I am, here's the the Roc

The .45 Glock that my older brother pop, shot

And I am finally on top

Too high up, not a drop

Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap

I am livin' like I ain't got it

Spit the flow so robotic, man who gives a fuck about it

If I never had a dark night I might not not not not be the same

Might not be the...



I know my mind is sober

But I'm so high, it's over

I Know my mind is sober

But I'm so high, it's over

And I want it ?



Ay-Hey now boy

You dont know nothing about this, right here boy

Chilling in [?] three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac

You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town

South Central with the KKK

Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat

Get the fuck up off your silver



Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average

They cutthroat yeah they savage

They riding round with the baddest bitch

One day, I woke up, and said I'm bout to do for the rest of my life

No question it's right

Waiting for the bus at a stop light looking at the cop right in front of my eyes

Living in a world of lies

Where the truth dies and hatred multiplies, mu-mu-mu-multiplies

I said I can't take it

I remember wondering if I would ever make it

But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident

I'm getting money for the hell of it

Never fuck around until the flow celibate

Speaking for the people like a delegate and when the situation's delicate

I execute it with the proper etiquette

Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no

I can't take the time to stop

It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top

But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop

Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in

While the whole world spin for the dividend

But I'm in another system

Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em

Why can't we relax and listen

Stop spending money on things that glisten



I know my mind is sober

But I'm so high, its sober

I Know my mind is sober

But I'm so high, its sober

And I want it ?

I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born out of wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock

Got my sites on deadlock

Visions of my enemy in a headlock

Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble

Just a youngin' in trouble

Took a shot and then made it a double

Took a shot and then made it a double

This that food for thought, my school ain't tought me good

No one greedy inside my hood

But a tablespoon of this baking soda gon' make it good, like it should

That's ignant isn't it

Hold up now wait, take a look at my pigment

Tell me again, we can never be kin based on the color of my skin

Matter of fact your lips ain't thin

That's a club I don't wanna be in

My DNA get done integrated

My God it's innovative

That's a million miles away from administrative

I fuckin' hate it, anyway

Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park

I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive

Police would knock on the door, I would hide

Then they would talk to me and I would lie

Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45

Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away

Over down on the driveway

Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade

Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that ""My Way""

By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn

Now I'm a grown man, oh man

What the fuck done happened to the plan

I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy

Anything but lazy, I can't sleep

Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker wide awake on the creep

Tryna kill you and he will too

We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal

I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel

My son, my seed

Watch 'em grown and then watch 'em lead

Let me proceed, bumpin' that that Californication, by the Red Hot

Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot

Y'all better not me fuckin' with me

Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC



Follow me to paradise

Follow, follow me

Follow me to paradise

Follow me to paradise

Follow, follow me

I remember my life long ago in my adolescence

I could feel the presence in my residence

Hesitant even thought it was evident

I should get the fuck

I know something is wrong

Yeah, I know something is wrong

Feel like my mind gone

I know I play along, I might drown in this song

Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this

Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice

Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed

Shit maybe then I'm noticed, huh, but maybe not

Feel like this minimum wage is contagious

So outrageous my age is on my mind

Walking to work and I go blind

Sippin' on that Koolaid, gettin' big wig money, that's toupée

Look around and see people with no class, like snow on a school day

Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do

Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu

Livin' life how I do is crazy

This shit never amaze me

But I still let it phase me and I don't know why

All I know is my mind racing

A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it yeah I be pacing

Bitch I'm back again

Been here since way back when, now let that shit begin



This album 2 but this song was written before the first

My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst

Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise

But it only makes it that much better when I rise



This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it

Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming ""I knew it!""

This is real, so real

The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill

Most of these people will never hit fruition

Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition

Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle

All alone with no one to dial

I'm just a man, I got problems, understand

This is all I ever wanted, yes I do it for the fans

And I ain't perfect

I've questioned if this life was even worth it

Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface

And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done

Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now

I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems

Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will

Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill

You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill

You gotta climb over your ego to master your will

Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension

This is dedicated to everyone that never made it

And the people that persevered even though they was hated

They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion

But on the real the road to success is prone to collision

And every now and then something happens that's unexpected

Like that newborn in your life because you fuckin' unprotected

And I swear nobody perfect, hell I know I ain't

Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint

Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can

Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man

Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow, teach 'em everything I know

Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe

And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong

But I had to do it all just so I could write this song

I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son

And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun

Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one

Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run

While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one

Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one

So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute, not a single second chilling in my new place

Motherfuckers getting two-faced

You know the name

Who else you know wanna come up, do it like I does it

Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it

Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it

I was workin' on a budget

Second time around shit is different cuh they know that boy good, know he does it

I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit

I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era

I got a berretta for people but I take care of the people when I jump in the cockpit and rock it

Been done, had this in my pocket

I had to wait to unlock it

Open that locket and see the picture I painted

No we ain't never aquainted

On the rise, look at defending

Now we trial for possession like an exorcism

My division is solely my vision, God damn

Can you feel it? Uh

I had a dream I would run the game and kill it

Had a dream, can you feel it?

Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit

Get up in it, make the shit infinite

Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent

I've been at it like an addict

Never at the party like I'm democratic

'Lotta static on the radio

Fuck everything that they represent

This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant

No never when I slide up in the spot, just a youngin' in the game

Tryna show 'em what I got, way back

That was the mentality, never truly reality

Looking for validation

With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation

Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation

Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation

Til I wised up, got 'em sized up

Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up

Man it's been a good ride up

Everybody want me to lace 'em, I'm too tied up

This a ransom

Fist full of money then we had back to the mansion

30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding

Couple years back you ain't give a damn

All the grass off the plane whenever I land

All part of the plan

Despite what they say is right and wrong

Despite they wonder (wonder)



Who am I, so high

I said they wonder who am I, so high



We'd like to be painters, we'd like to be poets. we'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows we can't earn any money that way. What do you want to do?When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that.. and uhm, forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time



You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don't like doing, which is stupid

It is absolutely stupid

Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you're doing, it doesn't matter what it is  somebody is interested in everything, anything you can be interested in, you will find others will



But it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like, and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See what we are doing, is we're bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lives we are living. In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing, so it's all retch, and no vomit it never gets there. Therefore, it's so important to consider this question: What do I desire?

William Kai: I would definitely have to probably have to say Kill Bill

Thalia: 114 feet

William Kai: Man, stylistically he's like, what's the name of that bitch, the lead character I forgot her name but he's like that bitch with like some Kung-Fu shit, he's like with his raps. It's fucking crazy

Quentin Thomas: You know in...in Pulp Fiction I mean, the way Tarantino constructed his shots, it's the same feel for me with his raps you know there's thought behind it

William Kai: No I could see that, I could see that but. Nah man, fuck that man.Kill Bill was the shit, especially like knives throwing and dodging and shit, and then fucking hot chicks fucking fighting each other and cutting each other's heads off, what the fuck is that?

Quentin Thomas: Yeah...fuck it (Prepare for surface landing) you're right, hot chicks and Kung-Fu, can't beat that

I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again

Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then

Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then

Yeah, yeah

But I'm, not defined by the sales of my first week

Cause in my mind the only way I fail, if my verse weak

As I, look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces

Compiled of different races gathering from different places

I just contemplate

Shoutout to those who can relate

And even though it gets hard I know my fate

With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight

Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates

It's like, I'mma get up today

I don't know how but I'mma find a way

Looking for the sun in a world of grey

Feeling like my dream is a world away

I'mma get up today

I don't know how but I'mma find a way

Searching for the sun in a world of grey

Feeling like my dream is a world away

What it feel like

I used to wonder what it feel like

Yeah, used to wonder what it



[Hook] (x4)

I used to wonder what it feel like

But now, I know, achieved the goal

I ran the race I won the gold



I used to wonder what it feel like

You can really do anything (x4)



Hello

Welcome to the Under Pressure program

My name is Thalia

I will be here to assist you

With the information about the album and its creation"
3lWCa9e0KhDghboM5L9C6d,Soul Food,1Mk7Lei0Ra3hawezqmad5V,Under Pressure (Deluxe),4xRYI6VqpkE3UwrDrAZL8L,Logic,292933,,2014,"God damn, god damn, conversations with legends
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe and think down and leave us, the baby cryin'

Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food

Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude

He whoopin' her ass, I kill him, I kill him, I motherfucking kill him

I said I really want to kill him, but I can't

Cause if I do po po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't

See my vision from pictures I paint

Do you feel it like I feel it, I grip the mic and then kill it

Okay, I'm gone, as memories resurface from hella long in my past

Chillin', sippin' Sinatra from a flask

Little bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby

Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery

Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store

Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door

Can't take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A

What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play

To this day I pay homage to the Gods, to the greats

Never stolen, I'm from Maryland

Where they shoot you in the dark of the night

Like Christopher Nolan, for talking out your colon

Catch me rollin' with the realest

Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero

Far from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in Goodfellas

If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella

Let me tap into my inner southern killer, another illa

Murder the game and then resurrect it like Thriller

Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa

We don't do it for the skrilla, we do it for love

Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs

And overdose 'em like the dealer does



Hip Hop



I swear this music in my genes like Denim

Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom

Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer

Even though heaven sent him



See my vision as I've elevated and risen

Open your eyes, despise lies with deadly precision

I finally made my way up out that section 8 division

Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'

But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings

While the label only care about making a killin'

Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G

That's the shit they never see

But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be

Bitch, I said I bet I be

Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me

Tell me how is they gonna remember me

As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe

Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me

Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love

And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove

Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it

I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred

I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it

Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted

While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted

Still that same motherfucker from that YS1

Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun

So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed

That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?

I just stop, and do my best to refrain

From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane

Will I die? Will I live?

Give the world everything I have to give

This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age

Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage

Even though it's in the millions that shit don't define my brilliance

Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions

Of people that separated, but all equal

To know the ending one must understand the prequel



I swear this music in my genes like Denim

Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom

Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer

Even though heaven sent him



Spit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em then we gone"

Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here

Don't fuck around cause they kill here

This music, it kill fear

I use it, when I need to hear

Been there, done that

Drop the shit, they gon' run it back

Simple shit, man I'm done with that

Fake rap, take it back

My chain heavy, got a lot of money

My bitch bad, have fun with that

I've been there and don't want it back

If I see the bitch I might run her back

Let's get drowned, on this vision, my division is the greatest that's around

Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)

This is where I'mma be for as long as I'm alive

I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this

But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this

They say ""what's your motivation?""

Cutting these records like back in the basement

(You never know, know, know, know)

I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic

I don't smoke but she love to smoke

And look good as fuck when she light it

When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it

Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it

Baby girl, where you been? I don't know

I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?

Shit girl I know that you want it

But fuck all that

Take the time to get down, stop all that running around

I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me

Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone

That's the type of shit that I'm on

Grip the mic and I go (whoo!)

Fuck around with this flow

Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just cause
Type of shit I see and probably wonder what it was

I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug

Basedheads coming through looking for the plug

Now, born and raised in my area

Beautiful by day, by night its hysteria

Fuck around and bury ya tonight

Ridin' with my homies on sight

Momma tell me to come in at night

Now I really gotta go, but they never know

Living life to the fullest, I got to blow

Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib

In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib

God damn, what it feel like, middle of the night

Waking up, scared for my life

Never had the heat, just a knife

When the gat go blat (GunShots) like that

Guarantee you it's a wrap, finna put you on your back

Like that

Just breathe, while their mama grieve

Bullet to the dome like an Aleve

Got to leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis

No, no, uh, uh

Just stop, stop, stop

fore they even call the cops

Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props

Tell me why another body even got to drop

Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related



""Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight.""



Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this

Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this

All about the money on a night like this

Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib

Got a lot to give but I never had the chance

Never had the chance, yeah

Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out

If you want it Imma lay it out

Hope my little brother make it out

Every night what I pray about

What I pray about, check it uh yeah

Got a son on the way

But I cling to the streets even though I want to run away

I imagine a better life

Where I never had a debt in life

Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -in the dead of night

Selling crack to my own pops

Pushing this weight on my own block

If I sell a brick I can buy a house

If they find the key they might lock me up

But I take the chance cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck

Take the chance cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck



Get down or lay down

Hit you with the Beretta you better stay down

Stray shots on the playground

Living how I'm living with the life that I'm given

Anybody that's riding with me, I'm riding with them

Show me the enemy and Imma hit em

The second I bit em I get em and hit em with the venom

Ain't no need to pretend Imma never do it

I knew it, all ready been through it

I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life

Anybody that's gang related"

Everything happens for a reason

People only in your life for seasons

Death and taxes that's all we give

You can make it work but that's still ain't driven

Give a lot but that's still ain't givin

Livin' life like this ain't real though

Every night like this I feel so

Dead wrong, collision is head on

My vision is dead and gone

Perception of right and wrong

I been here so very long

Right here in this very song

Look around everything changes

Seem like everybody just strangers

Don't go outside cause it's dangerous

Why everybody wanna be famous

I'm so OCD if they notice me

I might jump out the grave so they know it's me

Man everybody want this shit for free

Hand out palm up when they get to me

Elevated just to keep it innovative, innovated

Blowin' up like Iraq now

RattPack put me on the map now

No we never back down

Just take my time, I just take my time

I know, Imma get it like this

So everyone know that I did it like this

Yeah, I know

Battle the images out of my mind

Out the blue, like a Crip

But I never bang though, they know

We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the fame)

We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the)

We've been at it way before the fame, psyche

Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it

I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch

Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit

No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this

Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do

Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue

I'm coming through

If I see your bitch I bet she coming too, what it do

We ain't never switch it up, we keep it true

Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore

God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam

They know who I am

Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce

Fuck it, make it count

With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa

Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla

It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross

Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world

Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl

RattPack, know the deal

What's the motto? Keep it real!

We live in an era where they get deleted

I'm wondering if Imma make it

Man fuck it I'll take it, that record I'll break it

These bitches they love it, but I never covet

I just keep it going that's why I be flowing

I'm already knowing this life that I'm living

Don't know what I'm given

It's so hard not to give in

But I know where it was

I need Nikki, where is Nikki

Baby girl please come and get me

Now I'm old and shit is trippy, but I know that god is with me

This that baby mama drama

Give a fuck about a man I know Imma

Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun

End of the month, that's the worst of the month

But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt

That welfare check, check, won't ever bounce like my daddy did

But I'm glad he did cause it made me strong

Made me help somebody with this song

Paint the picture of my life

Growing up what it was like

Section 8, grab a plate

Food for thought, gravitate

Food stamps, social services tryna take me away

My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today

Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that's all I know

Just me and my homies, people that know me

Only ones that know

Around my way, living day by day

Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs

Five-O with them K-9's

Manhunt when it's game time

They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day

Now I'm running from the police, don't know how but I got away

Selling weed to my homies, and a girl in the building that know me

At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen

All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean

It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do

Such a youngin, such a fool

Now I'm breaking into school

Cause my homie told me to

What to do, what would you

When will I lose my anonymity and become one with the enemy?

Tell me would I be the enemy, feel like nobody in front of me

I can feel the vibe



Bobby what are you thinking?

What are you dreaming about?

Bobby, what's inside?

What are you thinking right now?

What are you thinking?

Go to sleep



I guess that I was just thinking things would be different now

Cause when I wake up my dreams fade

Everything cascade

In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames

Why must I open my eyes

I wish that I could stay asleep forever

Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever

Will it happen, maybe never

Maybe so, I got to know

But tell me why

I picture myself at the top but I know that I'm dreaming

Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons

Maybe not

All I know is this life I live I can't live it no longer

Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive

Turn on the TV let it wash my brain

Pretend that family's my family to avoid the pain

Hello children, how was school?

It was good, how bout you?

I love you (I love you son)

I love mama too

Are you ready for dinner? I'm able to set the table

Till I snap out the fable when that TV turn off and I realize I'm back in hell

I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the model

Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago

Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die

Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing

Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh

Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me

All that competition right there is dead to me

Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages

Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous

Boy, I've been feeling courageous

This shit right here, I've been at it for ages

Feels like I'm running through mazes, everybody has they phases

Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this

And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it

One of the few that be killing it uh

Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living

On the road to success you know that I'm driven

But they didn't wanna publish it, but right now I'm on some other shit

I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl

I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme

Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills

And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would



Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone

Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone



Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude

I look out of the window like goddamn, that's what I really do

Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I was to sustain

If I look back on it I would do it all over again

Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in

Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again

Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor

Crazy racist white bitch looking at us like ""Who are these niggas?""

First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash

Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash

Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain

Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane

Smoking blunts in Amsterdam, oh my God this is my jam

May-December by Mos Def in my headphones, that's the man



I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

And they wonder why I never get high



I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

And they wonder why I never get high



Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own

The thoughts inside my mind, be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone

I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?

It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away

God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am

Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van

Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala

Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah

Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers

I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer

Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this

Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice

Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive

Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive



I can't believe you don't like Tarantino

Ugh, I don't like him because, like, when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie

You mean like Inglorious Bastards?

I didn't see that

What?!

I didn't, I don't know

Oh my God, have you seen Pulp Fiction

Yeah, but I don't really remember it

What you talking about? Have you seen uh, this is funny cause we're on the train, have you seen, fuck! What's his name. The guy from the movie, in the place on the

On the train? With the scenery?

Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit, Source Code

No

You haven't seen that?

No

With the dude from Donnie Darko

Who's that?

Oh my God

Well I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is



I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

And they wonder why I never get high

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

And they wonder why I never get high

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz

I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs

Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go

Cause in the end what happens you already know

Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low

But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for

All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that

You the only girl I need I gotta have you back

Even though you turn my lungs black

Tell me where you've been jack

Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name Mary

I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing

Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy

But when I ended things with her it was just you and me

Doing me good, that's what I thought at first

Me and you together swear to god I saw that work

Away from you though man it's just so hard to work

Uh, my heart is hard at work

We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man

Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go

What will they write upon my grave

A free man born as a king, who died as a slave

But everything he gave her was for nothing though

Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go

You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas

All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous

All I know is I'm living the life I never would

Finally let you go, I thought I never could

Don't get me wrong can't forget the times shared

Seem like everywhere I go I always know you there

Tried to run but my legs won't

I look away but my head don't

I love it when you're fresh

I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath

I hate it that I need you, Nikki

But I love it when I feed you Nikki

I hate that I bleed for you

Uh, I long and I need for you

But I love it when I taste you

Nothing can replace you

I wish I could erase you, you're everywhere I go

But you're everywhere I long to be

And all these other people that don't seem to understand I'm just a man they always ask what's wrong with me

Man you're everything I crave

You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave

I'm a king, you're my Coretta

But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine



Slave for the

Said I'm a slave for the nicotine

Been a slave for ya

I'm a muthafuckin slave for ya

Slave for the nicotine

Nikki, Nikki slave for ya

I'm a slave for ya Nikki

I'm a muthafuckin slave for ya

Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone
Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid

Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days

Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all

Bumping Triple Six

Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks

Who the bitch riding with me?

Man, the devil tryna get me

Motivated, under-educated, and hated

But finally getting cake like a happy belated

Bitch I made it, we on

Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it

Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it

Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit

This is war, I declare it

Time is money, I can't spare it

Futuristic, so simplistic

Please decipher my linguistics

Slow it down, Robitussin

I'm the king, ain't no discussion

And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion

My consumption is the illest

Section eight, I know you feel this

On the come up, where they run up on you for nothing at all

Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?

EBT, that's the card

I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

God damn, god damn, we at it again

Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban

Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up

Fuck around and get messed up

When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine

You know that I'm one of a kind

Lemme get it right now, ho

Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho

Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so

On the down low, haters drown slow

On the down low, haters drown slow

Oh God, my God, we got it all right

Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?

These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?

I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?

Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck

I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut

That's what's up

All these bitches out here tryna gas it up

This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up

Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough

""Can I do it like you do it?"" That's what they be asking us

White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up

Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up

Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up

Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough

Now they know my name through the nation

Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation

Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations

Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making

Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken

Tell 'em jealous Judas is who this is, and man, that'll break 'em

And bitch I'm still the same

Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain

Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name

Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story

Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

(Hello, no one is available to take your call)

I been working hard, I been searching for God

I been working hard, I been searching for God

(Please leave a message after the tone)

Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you

But I insist you call me back cause I miss you

I wish you well, well, I wish you would call

Cause lately you feel like I'm just not your sister at all, all

I'm sorry for calling and balling, I'm all in

And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me

You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me

Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me

And lately I, I feel more like mommy, I know I'm me, but still

You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel

Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser

So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone

As as for [?] he left and he ain't coming back

I hate the man, if I see him I swear I tell him that

No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting, selling that

He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back

I been working hard, I been searching for God

I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud

Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me

And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me

Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure



Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother

How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya

Tried to call ya, where are ya?

In Paris? What a beautiful destination

In Paris, right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful

Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk

When I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad

It gets me thinking of incredible moments we've had

And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you

But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?

I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend

Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19

And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there

And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care

Of anything I need, of your family

Can I have some tickets to your next show?

Would you stand with me?

Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?

I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom

My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm

Maybe you could tell *beep*

I've been feeling under pressure



Hey, what's up, bro? I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga



Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant

Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent

I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it

I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place

Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl

It fell through, man, what a world

But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff

Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft

This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss

Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce

Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors

I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior

Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through

We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?

Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul

Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now

I heart that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel

How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?

I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined

But sometimes I wake and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing

They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth

I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth

This is everything I love, this is everything I need

Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed

This is everything I love, everything I need

Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed

Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure



Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I called you wouldn't even answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the ones you don't know, my sister, some of your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati. Then I gotta jail you out. I love you, son."

Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out

If I rush this shit, I might be without

But I need a vision, can't see without

I've been patient, never complacent

Left the underground when I left the basement

That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation

On the road with Kid Cudi and Big

Conversations with No I.D

Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay

Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me

If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be

Can't express what that meant for me, what it mean to me

Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be

It's so different now, everything is so different now

I've been there and I've done that

Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact

And I'm back again cause I love this shit

Write it down and they publish it

I went 5 years without a publicist, cause the word of mouth, they in love with this

I've been dreaming, I've been scheming

Went away a while but I've been fiending

I've missed the fam, but they know the deal

Been that way before the deal

Now the music got mass appeal

My main girl got ass appeal

Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing

Little fish, that went mainstream

Now I'm big as fuck

My whole city, they know what's up

I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit

I don't give a fuck

When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt

When I'm talking business, I might erupt

If you're at the show, put your lighter up

Fuck with me if you're really bout it

Outsiders, I could do without it

I crept in, got slept on

Sold out shows, no one knew about it

When it comes to fucks, I give two about it

Your cosign, I could do without it



Laaa daaaa

Laaa daaaa la da da da daa da da da da da daaa



Okay, last verse I gotta make it count

Won't speak on my bank account

So many commas I'd have to pause and I can't afford to just waste the bars

Every day boy I thank the Lord, I got a lot of problems but could have more

Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less

I been hungry like Budapest

Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck I just know I'm blessed

Love life even though I'm stressed

This business boy, I swear a test

Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check, I'll send Chris to go cut their neck

I love the building, no disrespect

But yall better ride when I'm in effect

That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet

If yall fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist, Imma intercept

It's my time, put half a mill of my own money in this album

That's my dime

No rap features, just my rhymes

My story, it's all mine

From the basement to the stadium

From the Roxy to Palladium

I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that

With this pretty girl on my floor, half naked playing Connect Four

But I've been trying to throw sex out the window just to connect more

She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind and then unwind with some slow head

All my homies like go ahead

Anyway, it's been a long time

And this here has been a long rhyme

So I gotta go, it's Logic

The one nobody would vouch for, how's that shit for an outro



Nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah

This is my story, Til The End

Nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah

This is my story, Til The End

Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah , Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Yeah



Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them

They may be misinformed about the truth

They may be misguided

Somebody has led them on the wrong path

A path of corruption and destruction, but yet God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved

Wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left

Relationships look closer in that rearview

Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you

So now you gotta stop, park, put that shit in neutral

Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with the sawed off

Blowin' up like a molotov

This is war everybody ain't no reason I'ma call it off

Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright

In the studio everyday so you know this shit about to be a busy night

Everything is all, everything is alright



It's finally famous over everything

Rattpack gang

What up though Logic, yeah

Day one shit right there



Hold up, let me get my mind right

Let me get my mind right

You know everything is alright

You know everything is all



Oh my God they plottin' and schemin'

Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'

They tryna take my blessins away

They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday

And I'm blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well

On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'

And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy

But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'

Got champagne problems, and I order more my wardrobe is Aura Gold

I'm a young nigga with a older soul

But still young enough to know I gotta know some more

I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician

She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician

She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up

Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up

Hype nigga back-back-back it up

Claimin' that we homies, boy stop

That's the type of shit I boycott

Yellin' fuck the 5.0, state troops

Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts

I got these good girls hoin' out

Tell me what the fuck you know about

Bein' that nigga that these niggas dont know about

Then they throw you in the game then you mothafuckin' blow it out

Now everything is alright



Hold up, let me get my mind right

Let me get my mind right

You know everything is alright

You know everything is all



Whippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off em

Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin

Im coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane

Nobody knowin' my pain but I be killin' cause I'm into the game

Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same

All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela

Hit you with a Beretta get you wetter than a umbrella

Ain't nobody better do it like me

I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me

Probably wanna fight me, but I just keep the peace

No need to keep a piece

I keep my enemies on a leash capiche?

And keep it real for the people I reach!"

I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again

Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then

Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then

Yeah, yeah

But I'm, not defined by the sales of my first week

Cause in my mind the only way I fail, if my verse weak

As I, look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces

Compiled of different races gathering from different places

I just contemplate

Shoutout to those who can relate

And even though it gets hard I know my fate

With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight

Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates

It's like, I'mma get up today

I don't know how but I'mma find a way

Looking for the sun in a world of grey

Feeling like my dream is a world away

I'mma get up today

I don't know how but I'mma find a way

Searching for the sun in a world of grey

Feeling like my dream is a world away

What it feel like

I used to wonder what it feel like

Yeah, used to wonder what it



[Hook] (x4)

I used to wonder what it feel like

But now, I know, achieved the goal

I ran the race I won the gold



I used to wonder what it feel like

You can really do anything (x4)



Hello

Welcome to the Under Pressure program

My name is Thalia

I will be here to assist you

With the information about the album and its creation"

Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe and think down and leave us, the baby cryin'

Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food

Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude

He whoopin' her ass, I kill him, I kill him, I motherfucking kill him

I said I really want to kill him, but I can't

Cause if I do po po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't

See my vision from pictures I paint

Do you feel it like I feel it, I grip the mic and then kill it

Okay, I'm gone, as memories resurface from hella long in my past

Chillin', sippin' Sinatra from a flask

Little bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby

Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery

Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store

Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door

Can't take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A

What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play

To this day I pay homage to the Gods, to the greats

Never stolen, I'm from Maryland

Where they shoot you in the dark of the night

Like Christopher Nolan, for talking out your colon

Catch me rollin' with the realest

Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero

Far from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in Goodfellas

If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella

Let me tap into my inner southern killer, another illa

Murder the game and then resurrect it like Thriller

Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa

We don't do it for the skrilla, we do it for love

Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs

And overdose 'em like the dealer does



Hip Hop



I swear this music in my genes like Denim

Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom

Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer

Even though heaven sent him



See my vision as I've elevated and risen

Open your eyes, despise lies with deadly precision

I finally made my way up out that section 8 division

Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'

But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings

While the label only care about making a killin'

Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G

That's the shit they never see

But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be

Bitch, I said I bet I be

Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me

Tell me how is they gonna remember me

As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe

Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me

Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love

And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove

Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it

I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred

I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it

Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted

While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted

Still that same motherfucker from that YS1

Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun

So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed

That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?

I just stop, and do my best to refrain

From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane

Will I die? Will I live?

Give the world everything I have to give

This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age

Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage

Even though it's in the millions that shit don't define my brilliance

Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions

Of people that separated, but all equal

To know the ending one must understand the prequel



I swear this music in my genes like Denim

Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom

Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer

Even though heaven sent him



Spit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em then we gone"

Don't fuck around cause they kill here

I use it, when I need to hear

Been there, done that

Drop the shit, they gon' run it back

Simple shit, man I'm done with that

Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)

This is where I'mma be for as long as I'm alive

I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this

But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this

Cutting these records like back in the basement

(You never know, know, know, know)

I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic

I don't smoke but she love to smoke

And look good as fuck when she light it

When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it

Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it

Baby girl, where you been? I don't know

I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?

Shit girl I know that you want it

But fuck all that

Take the time to get down, stop all that running around

I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me

Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone

That's the type of shit that I'm on

Grip the mic and I go (whoo!)

Fuck around with this flow

Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just cause
Type of shit I see and probably wonder what it was

I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug

Basedheads coming through looking for the plug

Now, born and raised in my area

Beautiful by day, by night its hysteria

Fuck around and bury ya tonight

Ridin' with my homies on sight

Momma tell me to come in at night

Now I really gotta go, but they never know

Living life to the fullest, I got to blow

Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib

In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib

God damn, what it feel like, middle of the night

Waking up, scared for my life

Never had the heat, just a knife

When the gat go blat (GunShots) like that

Guarantee you it's a wrap, finna put you on your back

Like that

Just breathe, while their mama grieve

Bullet to the dome like an Aleve

Got to leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis

No, no, uh, uh

Just stop, stop, stop

fore they even call the cops

Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props

Tell me why another body even got to drop

Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related



""Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight.""



Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this

Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this

All about the money on a night like this

Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib

Got a lot to give but I never had the chance

Never had the chance, yeah

Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out

If you want it Imma lay it out

Hope my little brother make it out

Every night what I pray about

What I pray about, check it uh yeah

Got a son on the way

But I cling to the streets even though I want to run away

I imagine a better life

Where I never had a debt in life

Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -in the dead of night

Selling crack to my own pops

Pushing this weight on my own block

If I sell a brick I can buy a house

If they find the key they might lock me up

But I take the chance cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck

Take the chance cause I need that shit and don't give a fuck



Get down or lay down

Hit you with the Beretta you better stay down

Stray shots on the playground

Living how I'm living with the life that I'm given

Anybody that's riding with me, I'm riding with them

Show me the enemy and Imma hit em

The second I bit em I get em and hit em with the venom

Ain't no need to pretend Imma never do it

I knew it, all ready been through it

I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life

Anybody that's gang related"

You can make it work but that's still ain't driven

Give a lot but that's still ain't givin

Dead wrong, collision is head on

My vision is dead and gone

Perception of right and wrong

Right here in this very song

Look around everything changes

Seem like everybody just strangers

Don't go outside cause it's dangerous

Why everybody wanna be famous

I'm so OCD if they notice me

I might jump out the grave so they know it's me

Man everybody want this shit for free

Hand out palm up when they get to me

Just take my time, I just take my time

I know, Imma get it like this

Just a youngin in this bitch up to no good
In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me

Out the blue, like a Crip

But I never bang though, they know

We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the fame)

We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the)

We've been at it way before the fame, psyche

Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it

I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch

Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit

No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this

Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do

Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue

I'm coming through

If I see your bitch I bet she coming too, what it do

We ain't never switch it up, we keep it true

Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore

God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam

They know who I am

Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce

Fuck it, make it count

With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa

Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla

It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross

Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world

Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl

RattPack, know the deal

What's the motto? Keep it real!

We live in an era where they get deleted

I'm wondering if Imma make it

Man fuck it I'll take it, that record I'll break it

These bitches they love it, but I never covet

I just keep it going that's why I be flowing

I'm already knowing this life that I'm living

Don't know what I'm given

It's so hard not to give in

But I know where it was

I need Nikki, where is Nikki

Baby girl please come and get me

Now I'm old and shit is trippy, but I know that god is with me

This that baby mama drama

Give a fuck about a man I know Imma

Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun

End of the month, that's the worst of the month

But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt

That welfare check, check, won't ever bounce like my daddy did

But I'm glad he did cause it made me strong

Made me help somebody with this song

Paint the picture of my life

Growing up what it was like

Section 8, grab a plate

Food for thought, gravitate

Food stamps, social services tryna take me away

My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today

Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that's all I know

Just me and my homies, people that know me

Only ones that know

Around my way, living day by day

Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs

Five-O with them K-9's

Manhunt when it's game time

They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day

Now I'm running from the police, don't know how but I got away

Selling weed to my homies, and a girl in the building that know me

At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen

All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean

It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do

Such a youngin, such a fool

Now I'm breaking into school

Cause my homie told me to

What to do, what would you

When will I lose my anonymity and become one with the enemy?

Tell me would I be the enemy, feel like nobody in front of me

I can feel the vibe



Bobby what are you thinking?

What are you dreaming about?

Bobby, what's inside?

What are you thinking right now?

What are you thinking?

Go to sleep



I guess that I was just thinking things would be different now

Cause when I wake up my dreams fade

Everything cascade

In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames

Why must I open my eyes

I wish that I could stay asleep forever

Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever

Will it happen, maybe never

Maybe so, I got to know

But tell me why

I picture myself at the top but I know that I'm dreaming

Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons

Maybe not

All I know is this life I live I can't live it no longer

Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive

Turn on the TV let it wash my brain

Pretend that family's my family to avoid the pain

Hello children, how was school?

It was good, how bout you?

I love you (I love you son)

I love mama too

Are you ready for dinner? I'm able to set the table

Till I snap out the fable when that TV turn off and I realize I'm back in hell

Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die

Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing

Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh

Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me

All that competition right there is dead to me

Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages

Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous

Boy, I've been feeling courageous

This shit right here, I've been at it for ages

Feels like I'm running through mazes, everybody has they phases

Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this

And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it

One of the few that be killing it uh

Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living

On the road to success you know that I'm driven

But they didn't wanna publish it, but right now I'm on some other shit

I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl

I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme

Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills

And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would



Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone

Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone



Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude

I look out of the window like goddamn, that's what I really do

Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I was to sustain

If I look back on it I would do it all over again

Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in

Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again

Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor

Crazy racist white bitch looking at us like ""Who are these niggas?""

First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash

Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash

Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain

Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane

Smoking blunts in Amsterdam, oh my God this is my jam

May-December by Mos Def in my headphones, that's the man



I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

And they wonder why I never get high



I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

And they wonder why I never get high



Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own

The thoughts inside my mind, be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone

I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?

It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away

God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am

Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van

Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala

Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah

Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers

I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer

Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this

Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice

Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive

Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive



I can't believe you don't like Tarantino

Ugh, I don't like him because, like, when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie

You mean like Inglorious Bastards?

I didn't see that

What?!

I didn't, I don't know

Oh my God, have you seen Pulp Fiction

Yeah, but I don't really remember it

What you talking about? Have you seen uh, this is funny cause we're on the train, have you seen, fuck! What's his name. The guy from the movie, in the place on the

On the train? With the scenery?

Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit, Source Code

No

You haven't seen that?

No

With the dude from Donnie Darko

Who's that?

Oh my God

Well I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is



I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

And they wonder why I never get high

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

And they wonder why I never get high

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

And they wonder why I never get high

Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz

I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs

Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go

Cause in the end what happens you already know

Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low

But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for

All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that

You the only girl I need I gotta have you back

Even though you turn my lungs black

Tell me where you've been jack

Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name Mary

I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing

Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy

But when I ended things with her it was just you and me

Doing me good, that's what I thought at first

Me and you together swear to god I saw that work

Away from you though man it's just so hard to work

Uh, my heart is hard at work

We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man

Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go

What will they write upon my grave

A free man born as a king, who died as a slave

But everything he gave her was for nothing though

Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go

You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas

All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous

All I know is I'm living the life I never would

Finally let you go, I thought I never could

Don't get me wrong can't forget the times shared

Seem like everywhere I go I always know you there

Tried to run but my legs won't

I look away but my head don't

I love it when you're fresh

I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath

I hate it that I need you, Nikki

But I love it when I feed you Nikki

I hate that I bleed for you

Uh, I long and I need for you

But I love it when I taste you

Nothing can replace you

I wish I could erase you, you're everywhere I go

But you're everywhere I long to be

And all these other people that don't seem to understand I'm just a man they always ask what's wrong with me

Man you're everything I crave

You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave

I'm a king, you're my Coretta

But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine



Slave for the

Said I'm a slave for the nicotine

Been a slave for ya

I'm a muthafuckin slave for ya

Slave for the nicotine

Nikki, Nikki slave for ya

I'm a slave for ya Nikki

I'm a muthafuckin slave for ya

Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone
Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid

Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days

Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all

Bumping Triple Six

Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks

Who the bitch riding with me?

Man, the devil tryna get me

Motivated, under-educated, and hated

But finally getting cake like a happy belated

Bitch I made it, we on

Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it

Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it

Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit

This is war, I declare it

Time is money, I can't spare it

Futuristic, so simplistic

Please decipher my linguistics

Slow it down, Robitussin

I'm the king, ain't no discussion

And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion

My consumption is the illest

Section eight, I know you feel this

On the come up, where they run up on you for nothing at all

Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?

EBT, that's the card

I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

God damn, god damn, we at it again

Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban

Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up

Fuck around and get messed up

When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine

You know that I'm one of a kind

Lemme get it right now, ho

Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho

Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so

On the down low, haters drown slow

On the down low, haters drown slow

Oh God, my God, we got it all right

Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?

These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?

I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?

Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck

I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut

That's what's up

All these bitches out here tryna gas it up

This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up

Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough

""Can I do it like you do it?"" That's what they be asking us

White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up

Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up

Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up

Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough

Now they know my name through the nation

Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation

Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations

Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making

Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken

Tell 'em jealous Judas is who this is, and man, that'll break 'em

And bitch I'm still the same

Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain

Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name

Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story

Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

(Hello, no one is available to take your call)

I been working hard, I been searching for God

I been working hard, I been searching for God

(Please leave a message after the tone)

Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you

But I insist you call me back cause I miss you

I wish you well, well, I wish you would call

Cause lately you feel like I'm just not your sister at all, all

I'm sorry for calling and balling, I'm all in

And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me

You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me

Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me

And lately I, I feel more like mommy, I know I'm me, but still

You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel

Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser

So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone

As as for [?] he left and he ain't coming back

I hate the man, if I see him I swear I tell him that

No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting, selling that

He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back

I been working hard, I been searching for God

I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud

Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me

And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me

Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure



Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother

How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya

Tried to call ya, where are ya?

In Paris? What a beautiful destination

In Paris, right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful

Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk

When I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad

It gets me thinking of incredible moments we've had

And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you

But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?

I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend

Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19

And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there

And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care

Of anything I need, of your family

Can I have some tickets to your next show?

Would you stand with me?

Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?

I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom

My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm

Maybe you could tell *beep*

I've been feeling under pressure



Hey, what's up, bro? I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga



Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant

Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent

I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it

I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place

Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl

It fell through, man, what a world

But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff

Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft

This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss

Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce

Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors

I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior

Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through

We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?

Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul

Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now

I heart that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel

How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?

I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined

But sometimes I wake and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing

They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth

I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth

This is everything I love, this is everything I need

Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed

This is everything I love, everything I need

Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed

Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure



Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I called you wouldn't even answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the ones you don't know, my sister, some of your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati. Then I gotta jail you out. I love you, son."

Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out

If I rush this shit, I might be without

But I need a vision, can't see without

I've been patient, never complacent

Left the underground when I left the basement

That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation

On the road with Kid Cudi and Big

Conversations with No I.D

Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay

Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me

If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be

Can't express what that meant for me, what it mean to me

Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be

It's so different now, everything is so different now

I've been there and I've done that

Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact

And I'm back again cause I love this shit

Write it down and they publish it

I went 5 years without a publicist, cause the word of mouth, they in love with this

I've been dreaming, I've been scheming

Went away a while but I've been fiending

I've missed the fam, but they know the deal

Been that way before the deal

Now the music got mass appeal

My main girl got ass appeal

Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing

Little fish, that went mainstream

Now I'm big as fuck

My whole city, they know what's up

I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit

I don't give a fuck

When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt

When I'm talking business, I might erupt

If you're at the show, put your lighter up

Fuck with me if you're really bout it

Outsiders, I could do without it

I crept in, got slept on

Sold out shows, no one knew about it

When it comes to fucks, I give two about it

Your cosign, I could do without it



Laaa daaaa

Laaa daaaa la da da da daa da da da da da daaa



Okay, last verse I gotta make it count

Won't speak on my bank account

So many commas I'd have to pause and I can't afford to just waste the bars

Every day boy I thank the Lord, I got a lot of problems but could have more

Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less

I been hungry like Budapest

Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck I just know I'm blessed

Love life even though I'm stressed

This business boy, I swear a test

Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check, I'll send Chris to go cut their neck

I love the building, no disrespect

But yall better ride when I'm in effect

That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet

If yall fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist, Imma intercept

It's my time, put half a mill of my own money in this album

That's my dime

No rap features, just my rhymes

My story, it's all mine

From the basement to the stadium

From the Roxy to Palladium

I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that

With this pretty girl on my floor, half naked playing Connect Four

But I've been trying to throw sex out the window just to connect more

She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind and then unwind with some slow head

All my homies like go ahead

Anyway, it's been a long time

And this here has been a long rhyme

So I gotta go, it's Logic

The one nobody would vouch for, how's that shit for an outro



Nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah

This is my story, Til The End

Nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah

This is my story, Til The End

Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah , Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Yeah



Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them

They may be misinformed about the truth

They may be misguided

Somebody has led them on the wrong path

A path of corruption and destruction, but yet God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved



Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah , Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Yeah
