Had the stick in my hand while I was typin' it

I know I'm arrogant, but don't be trifling

I iced out you once and you got iced again

These guitars sound like Parliament

I just blowed a check, baby, pardon me

All-black trim, dark burgundy

Keep it real with me, no perjury

Put them bags on her arm like weighed sand

Saks Fifth Avenue, she ran through eighty bands

Got your passport ready, we some aliens

Got my transporter up out my radius

Got my transporter, whip Mercedes-Benz

Abracadabra, make my side bitch better

Chanel trench, pussy taste like pineapple

Hey now, baby, that's the reason I was playin' 'round

Runnin' like a chicken with his head cut off

Through the streets where the freaks love the red leather

On my shoulder blades, in my older age

See the error of my ways, but I'm still not totally over all the temptation

Why does sin give you all the sensation?

Yeah, I'm with Future up in Onyx just wastin'

A lot of money on a stripper education

Throw so much paper that we causin' the inflation

Now it's late and I'm gettin' impatient

Might run a train on a bitch, Penn Station

Nah, I'm playin', I'm just lit, gettin' wasted

And she whisper in my ear she wanna taste it

Damn, you makin' it hard for me

But I'm stayin' strong, I got authority

Willpower, when I dub a baddie, I feel power

Twin Glocks with the switch piece that extend shots

It's a metaphor for the boy when you in proximity

I can't stop right now, they gon' remember me forever

My story's more clever, my similes was better

My energy was never on some toughest nigga shit

I was just a conscious rapper that would fuck a nigga bitch

I was just a college nigga from a rougher premises

Kept my nose out the streets, but I love to get a whiff

Of the action, with risk comes attraction

The blicks get to blastin', I turn into a track star

Wanted all the hoes, what the fuck you think I rap for?

I been tryna slang the same wood since Hacksaw

Jim Duggan, runnin' through the Ville in my Timbs, thuggin'

Now I'm with Young Metro in the V.I.P., bitch, it's incomin'

Coppin' all this liquor for these hoes like we McLovin

Thinkin' to myself, ""Could I really be with one woman?""

Hmm, I think so

But it's hard when you with your dogs at the freak show

Thinkin' I could bag Rubi Rose with a keystroke

Ego, ask yourself is that gon' bring you peace, though?

Save the day, anyway, then had to make sure she sign an NDA

Pretty girls all across the world, they know sensei

This mud got my mind goin', this a tax breaker, different timezone

Drink out the styrofoam, I ain't never been this high though

I just got my roll on, I ain't popped up like this in so long

I just like to vibe on her, went plain Jane, two-tone

Took some uppers, downers, mixed 'em up together

Runnin' through this money like it's never felt better

I just went to Cleef and bought the store from overseas

Shorty got me blowin' money fast like Meech

I pray to the angels but the devil is stronger

Wonderin' why I'm in hell, still?

Nobody's nice, nobody cares here

I tried to break free, she wouldn't let me

She said, don't waste my time, thinking I'm going to heaven

'Cause all my blessings she telling me, she the one who sent them



Angel on my left, devil on my right

It's hard for me to go, I've been fighting for my life

Been put through a test, tryna do what's right

It's gettin' harder and harder for me to find some peace at night



I danced with the devil so long, she pulling me closer

Feeling like a cigarette boat, all this water on me

I was at my big truck, my wrist up, get my dick sucked

When I switch my wrist up, switch my car, switch my bitch up

Every time I hit her, I broke her off then dismissed her

I been counting this paper all day, I'm getting blisters

Roadkill, every time I pop out in a new whip

Gettin' you wacked, niggas ain't running off with my new drip

Rolls hit, lights hit, platinum set, overkill

Killed shit and the nigga ain't have nothing to do with it, over-drill

When you in the field and you innocent, why you over here?

Body count, protocol, thotty count, losing count

Switch the count, large amount, overseas, can't pronounce

Sippin' syrup in a fur, get my dog, walk him down

Details inside of the photo, my fit was twenty thou'

Only see, everything this month, I bought an Onlysea

New Chanel, everything I say, these bitches oversee

Rolls key, pass the Lambo key, and the other key

Wiped down, cleaning my cars in the rain, I got OCD

I gotta remind you, I never liked you
In the streets, nigga
I love you

Streets turnin' boys into men

Take several down, lock it in

Got a stash, brought another bill

Pay you off before I shot and kill

Tell them other trenches that I ain't fell

I told 'em wait again, they weren't aware

I met her on sight, she got clapped

I was playin' with the chickens before I rapped



Treatin' this music like I'm sellin' keys

I took lil' mama then went down to Greece

Young nigga 'round me, slimey and greasy

I bought her diamonds and she keep it a secret

Knock your shit down, you know I'ma agree with it

Take off flyin', goin' off a G6

I got that cooler with me when I'm whippin'

Rollin' with demons when I'm in your city

Couple of pink toes gettin' nasty

Send all the Fentanyl to Cincinnati

Gone on a mission, niggas ain't really havin' it

Like I got a fishin' rod, that bitch bite

Whole lotta racks on me Beatles sitze

Lil' one whack songs when they bitin'

We been on demon time, say I'm nice

Ain't been gettin' no sleep, I'm outside

Kick down the doors of your door

Put double numbers on the billboards

I take the flowers, we gettin' awards

Too many shooters, I was paranoid

Young nigga poppin' off anywhere

Catch up and spray, nigga, anywhere

I gotta make sure I [?]

'Cause I'm in touch with the mob

A [?] ready, yeah, she anywhere, Jada finish up the job

But to the hood I'm a god

I did residentials, I was slaughtering

Just another product of poverty

Hit them niggas up, no recovery

I had Benjamins, Frank callin' me

Got them demons with me, ain't no argument

Trappin' out my pain with Givenchy

Forever wish death on all my enemies

The minute I was born, I was sinnin'

Chasin' a hundred billion, that's just the beginnin'



Streets turnin' boys into men

Take several down, lock it in

Got a stash, brought another bill

Pay you off before I shot and kill

Tell them other trenches that I ain't fell

I told 'em wait again, they weren't aware

I met her on sight, she got clapped

I was playin' with the chickens before I rapped



Streets turnin' the boy to a millionaire, ayy, yeah

Took all the struggle from the game and it got me here

Drinkin' on muddy, smokin' herb by the pound, ooh, ooh

Wish I could fall in love but she been ran through

Who the flyest?

Ain't no goin' back and forth, ain't no debatin' with me

Keepin' the drum on me

Gotta keep fifty brothers for my many men

These streets they prepared a nigga for everything

Everything I ever wanted in my life

I hustle and I'm grindin' up to earn it full

For the Bugatti, sign me up

Charge one thousand to just line 'em up, line it up



Oh yeah (Oh yeah)

Yeah (Yeah)

Yeah (Yeah)

Young nigga pop (Young nigga pop)

Catch up and spray (Catch up and spray)

I gotta make sure I aim (I gotta make sure I aim)

Woo

Just the finishin' (Just the finishin')

Hood (Hood)

I take care of families
I'm embarrassed over this mess that I done caused
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides

Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'

Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry

Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi

Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night

I don't know her name, she wanna have my child

Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild

I lost connections to the streets and I was in denial

I seen a grown man shed tears 'cause he lost his trial

I saved the streets, a crazy feeling just to lose a child

Have a one-on-one with God, yeah, it been a while

I woke up paranoid off drugs, I said, ""I'm tired now""

I answer my phone in the middle of the night, like, ""Who done died now?""

Gotta treat you like you dead when you playin' bogus



See, Pluto, you my brother, gotta stay focused

Sometimes I get in my feelings, too, I wish I wore a Trojan

I'm just tryna teach the killers not to use emotion

I got a whole bitch, don't think about my old bitch

Girl on a girl, if they eat that's a topping

Thought she was true, she was fuckin' the opps

Can't tell her name, might be workin' with cops

Told me she loyal, I found out she not

Can't trust a unfaithful girl at the spot



Head over water, I ain't never gon' flop

Everything I do is super galore

Fuck on rich niggas, she don't care if you broke

Protectin' my heart like never before

Keep her around and she moral support

Three in a condo, rm keeping' 'em stored

Trap out the house with the bills on the floor

Ran outta hard, had to cook up some more



I'm gettin' higher than satellite

You can get flyer than me in my afterlife

Sit down and watch me and have a bite

Put it on the floor, she gon' eat it up

Put it in a safe, we gotta keep it up

Throw 'em in a lake, you gotta teach 'em somethin'

Seen a wing on the pedal, and I stomp to the floor

Cost a couple of Ms tryna save a whore

Perky is a blessing and there wasn't a loss

Wrapping' a bale feel like my hand was forced

Put one of the girls in an executive Porsche

Crib with a maid, and it came with a horse

Cover the green like a golfer on course

Purchase that lean with no problems, of course

Brought the machine with the money ain't short

Where I come from, you know trappin' is sport



Codeine, it sit on my kidney and dissolve

Hit a few licks with my dawgs, we mobbin'

Called a few chicks on my line, they slobbin

Girl on a girl, if they eat that's a topping

Thought she was true, she was fuckin' the opps

Can't tell her name, might be workin' with cops

I took a chance when you had miles on you

I should've fucked and blowed some loud on you

I'm in the cut, I got a crowd on me

Infatutation turn to love on me

A sober mind wasn't good for me

'Cause I love you way more than this music

That's when shit was brought up and you know I had to lose it

Damn, I almost lost it

Said it was cheaper not to keep her and it's killing me

I come with the drank

I come with the drapes

I crush out the face

Patek Phillipe, I'm too unique

Gotta stop all the leaks

I pour up codeine

I can't go to sleep

Thanks to the gang, gang

Louboutins, sitting in a row

Louis Vuitton's, mink on the flows

My migo the coldest

He got me the frozest

I ordered it loaded, soon as they touched down

I sold it

The money is stacked up off the ground

You could never fold it

I done got racked up

I done stacked up me a fortune

Colossal, enormous

Have you seen my preformance

You making it drizzle

I got thunder and storming

Cash on deliver, hope you're not recording

Ain't no discussion

I got 'em busted

I got a flooded Richard Mille

It ain't no cuffing

Screaming, blushing

She came from Russia

Digital scale

My kind is rare

I had to prevail

I made it through Hell

See the wheel on the right

When you live overseas

Think it came overnight

How I make it look easy

Ain't a regular nigga

I accept that

Got ahead of you niggas

And I never took a step back

Grab a couple chicks, then nail them

Take 'em to the hood, then sell them

Fam come first, you never fail them

Rebellious, always respect my elders

That's why I might treat you like I'm careless

Sold crack to a pregnant lady

Forgive me for the crack baby

If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real

Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed

Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real

Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'

Fame change, the family loves the way it is

Fame change, a ho loves the way I give

Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal



Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you

Sorry it's gotta be this way

Ain't mean to try to desert you

Sorry, tryna be this way

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really tryin'



It can get scary when you legendary

Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry

Cash rules everything around music

The game doped up, every nigga usin'

Grab the .50 carbon, hit him with the tool

I'm not tryna argue, I got issues

You see what I've been put up against, baby

You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby

Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby

Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby

It's hard to caress you

All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you

Commercial flights gettin' too hectic

V12 motors, my confession

Tryna identify, you look sketchy

I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me



Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you

Sorry it's gotta be this way

Ain't mean to try to desert you

Sorry, tryna be this way

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really tryin'



Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh

Child is so phony, I got somethin' to prove

Work every day like I got somethin' to lose

I'm sick, I got me flown up, nothin' new

Styrofoam cups, everything is approved

Styrofoam cups, everything is approved

Money stand up and it got me seduced

I got that hot though, but I got that loose though

Ayy, my Lamb hit a pothole

These bitches some thot hoes

I hit the lotto in South Africano

Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo

Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto!

Better come with a combo

Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana

Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, Mufasa

I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper

Implicate problems when I did send flowers

King like Mufasa, messiah, then higher

Goshies and Rollies, yea fuck on a police

Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the C.O

My wrist got an ego, my watch in an igloo

We took illegal, got stripes like a zebru

Pimp like a rollin' stone, high when I greet you

Tryna just stall on you, efficiently ball on you

L-O-to-V-E, I hope you get greedy

Chasers do numbers, man chains is on VG

Couldn't had your heart 'cause you gave it to easy

Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Jeezy

Shout out to DiDi, got goonies on speedy

She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG

I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded

Persian, Malaysian? super sensation

Yah... sushi was raw when she got confiscated

No invitations, we showed up and made it

Long as my dawgs and bitches betrayed you

Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it

I turned the pages, heavily sedated

Too many clone me, too many phonies

Armani on me, you never warned me

How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?

Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended

Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image

Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny

Fuck y'all, I skrrt off 'cause everything shitty

I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'

Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed

Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city

In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'

Indian Cherokee, clarity

Shinin' is therapy, money is ready

Money is ready



Ain't really mean to hurt you

Sorry it's gotta be this way

Ain't mean to try to desert you

Sorry, tryna be this way

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Sorry it's gotta be that way

Ain't mean to desert you

Sorry that it looks that way

Ain't really tryna hurt you

Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really tryna..."

Rolex store's my bando

Boy George Bush with the ammo

I spent an M on indo

Put it on an 18-wheeler

Trappin' and rappin', finessin'

I go beyond for the scrilla

Freezin' that ice out your chest

You lookin' just like a dealer

Add it all up on an iPad

Talk to the plug on a car phone

Went to Miami and re'd up

Rovers, push it



Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it

Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it

Shit gettin' too specific

10 black whips I'm too consistent

To my foreign bitches tell me if I'm too persistent

All my baby mamas, I just bought em brand new Benzes

I need a power of attorney, I'm bout to fuck up some M's

I need a power of attorney, you need to get this on film

I'm bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym

I'm bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym



I'm 'bout to water whip it

So I could fuck up a bag

I'm bout to cop me a Mazzi

I'm bout to cop me a Jag

I done made 21 million

I got a zillion stacks

I done made 21 million

I had to run up a sack

I'm bout to twerk dem numbers

Bout to go get me a hundred

I done went gram from gram

I done been workin' a hundred

I made a fair amount

Stunted and doubled my digits

Just know that Pluto is hungry

Like when I worked a midget

I am original gang member

I'm not a New Edition

They ain't gonna never be able to see me

I'm bout to make them admit it

Everywhere I go is Fiji

Everywhere shine for the city

Everywhere I go is foreign

Wake up, take out the ceiling

She ain't leave when I was broke
Juugin and finessin'
She ain't leave when I was broke

Yeah



I had to climb out the sewer

Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'

Hold me down

Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it

Sometimes I try to be there for you

And my plan, it don't go like I want it

Watch me roll this dope, watch me

Came out the sewer, it's stankin'

Go in the booth and I'm blankin'

Slept with my tool on the blanket

Like I'm the son of Michael

All of these haters, they're gettin' spiteful

They see my heart has been damaged

You see the whip Panoramic

You see I made it, you witnessed progression

I was talkin' like I knew I was destined

I'm a boss and I won't ever regret it

Whether you like it, you gotta admit it

Then I change up your location

Then I pull up in that Wraith

Have I fulfilled all your dreams?

I gave you checks

So you're checkin' it off on your wish list

You get Ferraris right now

We doin' Cali right now

We goin' shoppin' right now

I see they're coppin' right now

I see they're watchin' right now

They didn't know I was just plottin' right now

I've been executin' the play for a while

Witnessed trappin', baby walk down the aisle

I got a few rings on me now

Had to change my team and my style

You can't intervene on my craft

You better turn your back right now

Ain't no turnin' back right now

I can't let you cramp my style

If you ain't blink then you lookin' like an owl

Starin' right back 'cause you lookin' like cow

You gettin' no sniff, sleepin' with the flowers

She understand everything I go through

Gutta nigga always

I'm a mothafuckin' boss, I'm a mothafuckin' boss

I'm a mothafuckin' giant

I see how you smile

I sit back and watch how the drama unfold while I'm on recline

I know the homies, my brothers, my cousins

They gon' ride for me

I know Tiarra, and Britney, and Keisha

They gon' lie for me

I got some people they know that I love 'em

But I ain't got time to see

Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it

Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey

I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty

Bring that ace, bought a case, my niggas with me

Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me

Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing



And you know what I need from you when I get home

You better not be on the phone

Talking up a storm like you usually do

Talking up your friends like you usually do

Telling them I never spend time with you

It's hard to find a time we been



Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason

Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason

Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect

Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing



I'm familiar with this cash flow

And if you juggin' you can vouch for me

I did it my way, you could vouch for me

I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie

Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me

Bad bitches wanna come buy the paparazzi on me

I got so many bad bitches that I barely wanna

I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance

I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but



(x4)

Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing



You doing me dirty (x4)

You know

How we let it get like this I don't know

But that nigga can't save your soul, nah

Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty

Haven't a nigga heard from you

How can you live with yourself

Haven't even heard from you

How can you live with yourself

Ungrateful, ungrateful

Your momma be ashamed of you

I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you

Ungrateful

I'm too good for you, too good for you

You should go back to a perfect match for you, unstable

Doing me dirty (dirty, dirty)

You're making me nervous

I haven't even heard from you

You look drained, you look exhausted

Girl them late nights ain't good for you

Really starting to show on you

Don't hit me up when it's good for you

Ungrateful"

But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it

I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort

But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together

Yeah, not here to fight wars

But niggas wanna talk high scores

PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche

And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were to die for

But I got bigger fish to fry

I'm talking bigger shit than you and I

Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine

And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified

Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night

Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement

I just got me the Mercedes Pullman

You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google

Back in the city, shit is getting brutal

These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies

They've been dropping out on both sides

We ain't in it, we just ghost ride

The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines

I thought you wanted yours like I want mine

I guess you just making moves on your own time

But just know it'll be January in no time

And your absence is very concerning

It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning

Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30

Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey

I got a club in the Raptors arena

Championships, celebrations during regular seasons

Paternity testing for women that I never slept with

I'm legally obligated if they request it

So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson

Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction

Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting

Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum

I just listened to Closer To My Dreams

Wide eyed and uneducated at 19

I can't rap like that, all young and naive

Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe

Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience

I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it

4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious

You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it

I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways

Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away

Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start

And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing

Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion

Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming

They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden

Now you the one getting buckets

They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches

Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to

And women that you seen on TV look better in person

And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes from there

But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action

The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually

What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?

Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?

We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?

Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?

My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf

And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves

Papi champú, young pablito de sies dios

6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I

And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?

Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena

But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know"

'Cause I'm honest, I didn't, when you, 

They put you on the MTV -uh, what was it-, 

The top 10 best rappers, I don't know what the number was, 

I was like 'why is Future on that list?'



Is that, is that, I might've mistaken, 

I might've read it wrong. 

I might've seen a one before the five.

I be telling him, he inspired me to go harder
Know what I'm saying, real talk

My savages, my savages, my savages
I’m always dressing fresher than a mannequin

I grew up in a ruthless ass environment

I’m on the phone with yo, I ask him how the trial went

35 racks is how my day was spent

I gotta cock it back, that’s how my day would get

You got me thinking all these bitches artificial

The way you acting you must don’t respect a real nigga

Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up

They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us

I told you way before what happened they was hating on us

You know when we was juuging for it they was mad at us

Aye, this a letter for my dogs

How we let the money get between us

How we let these bitches get between us

How we let these niggas get between us

I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers

I got love but it ain’t like the love I got for India

She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity

My lil dog caught a murder, gone for infinity

Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me

RIP my GrandDad Quick, he should have seen this shit

20 thousand O’s of child support, I seen that shit

Riding round with all them choppers, I done seen this shit

These rappers mad at me but these niggas ain’t doing shit

And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit

I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership

The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships

If Esco didn’t love me would’ve been done jumped ship

And it’s the love from my fans got me still here



Monster!

Say I’m Illuminati, they tryna make me catch a body



I don’t know when I'ma flip, nigga

Get me some codeine and sip, nigga

Big bank saying wipe a nigga’s nose, my girl changed the lock on the doors

Before this shit pour up a fo', ain't falling in love with no ho

That what you want for me? That what you really expect?

You thinking I’m sitting up depressed?

I'm somewhere countin' up me a check

I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that’s my only regret

Drag the mink on the floor

The Cuban links on my ho

Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?

Who would think we was poor?

There’s money laying on the floor

Got some hoes laying on some hoes

Got a shawty with me, she a pro

No she’ll never meet another nigga not another nigga like me

Even if he got a billion dollars he can’t make her cum like me

Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image

Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented

Because the Spurs weren't tinted, I told em ain't got nothing to hide

I told em I’ll do with the pies, told em fuck all of my roles, I don’t even write



My savages, my savages, my savages

We gone leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin

Loyal for life, you heard?

Shit ain't been the same, they talkin' bout me on the 'gram

They say I turned my back on my baby mama, I'm on them tabs

And my hood looking up to me, I love them niggas to death

Even in the after life, when ain't a breathe of me left



Chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian

All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland

Molly on fire, and I'm sipping out the styrofoam

Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium

Bend it up, pose for a Freeband President

I'm counting out y'all, while I'm counting up these Presidents

Slide down on a new diva, but that's what we about

Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so po'd up

Two seater, plush, few racks in the bump

A few goons in the cut, I treat 'em just like brothers

Treat 'em just like brothers, treat 'em just like brothers

A few goons in the cut, I treat 'em just like brothers"

Know what I'm saying, real talk

My savages, my savages, my savages
I’m always dressing fresher than a mannequin

I grew up in a ruthless ass environment

I’m on the phone with yo, I ask him how the trial went

35 racks is how my day was spent

I gotta cock it back, that’s how my day would get

You got me thinking all these bitches artificial

The way you acting you must don’t respect a real nigga

Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up

They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us

I told you way before what happened they was hating on us

You know when we was juuging for it they was mad at us

Aye, this a letter for my dogs

How we let the money get between us

How we let these bitches get between us

How we let these niggas get between us

I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers

I got love but it ain’t like the love I got for India

She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity

My lil dog caught a murder, gone for infinity

Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me

RIP my GrandDad Quick, he should have seen this shit

20 thousand O’s of child support, I seen that shit

Riding round with all them choppers, I done seen this shit

These rappers mad at me but these niggas ain’t doing shit

And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit

I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership

The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships

If Esco didn’t love me would’ve been done jumped ship

And it’s the love from my fans got me still here



Monster!

Say I’m Illuminati, they tryna make me catch a body



I don’t know when I'ma flip, nigga

Get me some codeine and sip, nigga

Big bank saying wipe a nigga’s nose, my girl changed the lock on the doors

Before this shit pour up a fo', ain't falling in love with no ho

That what you want for me? That what you really expect?

You thinking I’m sitting up depressed?

I'm somewhere countin' up me a check

I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that’s my only regret

Drag the mink on the floor

The Cuban links on my ho

Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?

Who would think we was poor?

There’s money laying on the floor

Got some hoes laying on some hoes

Got a shawty with me, she a pro

No she’ll never meet another nigga not another nigga like me

Even if he got a billion dollars he can’t make her cum like me

Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image

Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented

Because the Spurs weren't tinted, I told em ain't got nothing to hide

I told em I’ll do with the pies, told em fuck all of my roles, I don’t even write



My savages, my savages, my savages

We gone leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin

I turned the whole world up

Now they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin'

These niggas so broke, instead of go and get it

They'd rather go ask for somethin'

Remember them days I had to load it up

And put on my mask for somethin'

Remember we juuged for somethin'

Remember we take for somethin'

I spent 3 stacks on these Rick Owens, I try my best to forget it

I pour my life inside these poems, my whole soul and my spirit

I'm easily agitated, get intoxicated, tryna fight the demons

Tryna find right and my wrong, hope my legacy live on

Hope my legacy live on

That's why I wrote this song

I ain't have to write this song

Future Hendrix is forever



Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly

Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything

You know I hardly forget anything"

Fixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein

Red lean in a Fanta, you can't taste the caffeine

Customs stamp my passport, I'm on my way to Beijing

Smashin' on a trophy, crashin', I might OD

Checkin' out my moji

I just came from Oslo, Norway, everything was gourmet

A couple million worth in whips when I step out my doorway

I just, I just, I just throwed a bird away in Lenox

Went to Magic, throwed some racks, and nigga I ain't finished

Baby promise me you'll never go trip on what I be sippin'

And I'm affiliated with them gangsta niggas like Don Cannon

I just told my jeweler, ""Go and make me 10 rings""

Yeah I won, I'm pimpin' on some bitches, call me Future Don Juan

I got Murder Squad with me and I brought your broad with me

Know some trigger happy niggas that'll go to war with me

And I'm Lil' Mexico until the Lord come get me

Codeine crazy, yeah
Pour that bubbly, pour that bubbly
Pour that bubbly, pour that bubbly
Pour that bubbly, we done went through too much
You hear me?



[Bridge:]

Pour that bubble in, drink that muddy drink that muddy drink that muddy

When we're cuddling, yeah I'm covered in

I was thugging it, I was just loving it

That's for them other niggas, for

They ain't for you dog, thats for them other niggas

That ain't for you shorty, thats for the other bitches

I'm going crazy bout it, I'm going codeine crazy

Thats how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely

I'm drinking bubbly



[Verse 1:]

Take all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah

Audemar, this not a carnival, but this is a royal Cartier

Don Peringnon I get down with the brown, I just shuffle around

I pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town

I can rip through your town with them guns and them pounds

I grew up on them grounds with the dealers and hound

We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass em around

I say everything triple time, Rollie, AP, Hublot triple time

I just know the ones you call upon, I just had to pay my dawg a bond

Looking at me like a triple threat, everytime a nigga talk a check

Smoke the kush up like a cigarette, Run it back you hear my intellect



Celebrate like a championship, celeberate like a championship

Celebrate like a championship, celeberate like a championship

I told you I told you I told you I told you I told you I told you



[Verse 2:]

Dont tell me you celibate to the mula, I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler

I just wish you'd stop perpetrating like a goonie

I adopted niggas straight out the sewer

Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it

I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors

I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'

Take it back and take a look at yourself

Take the lesson; put it all in the air

Too many days gone by

Sittin' by the phone - waitin' 'til I reply

Drying my eyes, believe it or not

I could never see a tear fallin'

Water drippin' off of me like a faucet

I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle

Spent another 60 thousand on a Rollie

All my diamonds got you brainwashed, she sucked my dick and got my brainwashed

And for the shit it got your man popped

See what they did to Biggie and Pac

Pour a lil' liquor, pour more lil' liquor

Pour it up pour it up pour it up



[Hook:]

Codeine crazy, codeine crazy

Codeine crazy, codeine crazy

Codeine crazy, codeine crazy

All this motherfucking money got me going codeine crazy



[Verse 3:]

Drownin' in Actavis, suicide

When I hit the scene it's homicide

Diamond pinky ring  a lollipop

Fuck the hate  I pull up in a drop

Diamonds colder than a glacier

Ballin' harder than the Pacers

I been tryin' to have some patience

Told my momma she should pray on it

Told the streets they gotta wait on it

She gonna put a nigga name on it

I just dropped a whole thang on it

I'm making U.S.D's overseas

That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve

Fucked my white girl, she said Nigga please.

Fuck that white girl, she said Nigga please.



Playin' poker  now we're back at Stroker

I forgot her name, but her pussy's soakin'

When I seen her on a pole

Reminded myself when I used to come over

Reminded myself when I used to get loaded

Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded

The coupe fully loaded. This whip fully loaded

This whip fully loaded. The clip fully loaded

I try to control this

Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles

These niggas who bogus, let's pour up propane

I'ma fuck around and faint like I'm Kid Cudi probably

I fuck around and faint, I'ma fall on a drink

Rockin' Tom Ford. Poppin' molly

Married to this motherfuckin' money



[Hook]



[Verse 4:]

You thought I forgot about us? I know that you know I dont fold under pressure

I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal

We live by the codes of the ghetto

I'm closing this out with my memo, im treating this shit like a demo

I'm putting my heart and my soul in the shit and some mo'

I'm in that dolce gabbana, I might get after madonna

I get the crack in the summer, trapping in the lac and the hummer

Fronting some crack to my partner, all this lingo got her panties to dropping

Fuck the fame I'm sipping lean when I'm driving, all this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it

I'm an addict and I can't even hide it, Don't you panic panoramic companion

They was tryna' serve me at the arraignment, never comment on it, never complaining

I'm taking everything that comes with these millions

I'm taking everything that comes with my children

Yeah

I got all my jewels on me and I'm still in the hood

I can never stop from grinding cause I made it out the mud

I can never forget when I was on the block selling drugs

Codeine calm my nerves I was getting high since a kid

The sacks that I sold

Kept my baby out the cold and her belly full of food

And her back never lacking of clothes

This game is so grimy it's impossible to win with your innocence intact

Matter of fact it deranges

The person that you wanted to remain intrinsically changes

We can actualize but our actual lives are affected by a hunger for sane-ness

In the back of our minds are the nastiest lines that a dope emcee never came with

Once we get tired of fakin', unchain the beast in the brain that awakens

See the clear path that I used to couldn't see

Be the kind of artist that I thought I couldn't be

Become that man that'd rather die standing than ever live head down bending a knee

So I purify my soul in the land of the fire

My sweat and my tears dull pain

And the blood that I leave on the battlefield proves what I've always known

Run in your spot smashing your ho fuck on your couch

Quit Running your mouth flipping my pen beginning to end

Telling the plot look at my watch fuck all your thoughts

How can I not make you niggas regret how can I not go and get me a check how can you not get hooked on percocet

How can you not be the one who was star how can you not be the one who was king

How can you not come around all these niggas and I stare at these niggas be rocking this bling

Bundles falling all out your pocket

Pimps up, pimps up, hoes down, hoes down

A pool full of money and I'm 'bout to drown

[Intro]
You know, This just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?

[Hook]

(aye)

Slang a bunch of narcotics (then what)

Pull up in that new rarri (yea)

Living like John Gotti (the mob)

Chopping bricks like karate (chwaaa)

Drink a bunch of codeine (drank)

Serving to the dope fiends (they smokers)

Blowing money, stay clean (free bands)

Michael Jackson, Billy Jean



[Verse 1: Future]

Got a panamera round a young nigga neck (porche)

Got a young bitch pulling up in a vet (she working)

Smoke a lot of kush & I have a lot of sex

Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check

Bitch nigga get money, nigga get that

Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack

You can hit a nigga line, order what you want

I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk

50,000 on yo watch, young nigga splurge

Pop a ace of spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup

Keep a young nigga workin' .....

I'mma take a phone call, hustle everyday



[Hook]



[Verse 2: Future]

Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider

Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer

Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idle

I was never snitching, I can put that on the Bible

In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle

Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya

Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's

We was grinding up from a tube & a baby

Got the girl dripping wet like a jerry curl

Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup

Send it over from Lil Mexico & Let me Work

I can get 36 for a clean shirt



[Hook]



[Verse 3: Casino]

Hol' up sir, you in my Rari

Money like I'm Frank Matthews

Killers around me like I'm Gotti

If I tricked you, know I'm sorry

I be fresh don't need no stylist

I be geeking on them mollies

Sell remix don't sell no cleans

My hand like a triple beam

I got workers like machine

All I do is sell dreams

Have my niggas serve fiends

I get up and then I lean

Bought a phantom cause I always wanted one
Made a film with them bitches ain't no one on one
Got this watch and this watch like a 101

All my niggas millionaires it ain't just one

Had a few chains on, I don't have but one

Bought a few house and I never sleep at one

And I can have ten cars and I wouldn't drive one

And when you make it from the bottom you the chosen one



[Verse 1: Future]

Rich nigga since birth, Louis v chinchilla

Bought a brand new Rover, drive it like a 4 wheeler

Solid gold: AP, flooded out with them crystals

Shinning just like molly, I woke up in a new bugatti

Free lil Kirk Wood, Young Gotti, free my nigga White Boy too

I woke up to a new baby and a spend that on Jimmy Choo

You got goons around you nigga, I keep shooters around me fool

Im a young rich nigga from the bottom I came up and I can't lose



[Hook]



[Verse 2: Rocko]

Guilty by association that's a lie

How dare you make that accusation I'm an A1 nigga

Check my verification, do whatever to protect my reputation

Make sure you tell em that, multi-faceted business owner hustler

Work pump it up inflation, run your numbers up

Extra point escalation, how you spell dedication

What you know about determination?

Salute the BET, appreciate your nomination

RIAA, appreciate my certification

Got a job for a hater where your application

All that hatin shit, really admiration

Cus this shit's startin to take a toll

Make you spit that safe combination, I'm like Listerine

And even though I'm not an artist this is where I draw the line

We don't feel none of you niggas

Y'all some fuckin porcupines

I still got residue all on my dinner plates

Real niggas in my inner circle

None of my checks come late, I ain't having that, I give em curfews,

Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my first dress

Surprise yo ass like a baby taking his first steps

I'm too good but just in a bad bitch

Smoke like I've been kissing dragons

9 mill conjure her missing panties

That pussy felt like a hidden valley

Thank God that I'm so gifted

I wouldn't return a single gift

But all good things must come to an end

Like this blunt burning my fingertips

This ain't what you want

Put that gun to yo ho head

Make her tell me what you don't

Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!

Just a young hood nigga streets raised me

Working wit a unit tryna stretch it to another one

Drinking on that active and it's tasting like some bubble gum 

Thumbing through a check born on a jet

Talking on the iPhone sipping out tha styrofoam 

That dirty got my mind gone that money got my mind blown

I'm rolling like a rolling stone

Free Bandz and Al Capone

And my cash way long (turn up)

I see a bunch of clones

Give me apartment and some water and I can swim

Got that Gambino jumping out the gym

My young nigga serving J's that's how I clear 'em

Jumping cross me you know your chances slim

In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes 

When I cash that cash money smell like cocaine 

Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan

Walk inside the jeweler drop my bail on your ring 

Spent so much in Louis gave me free champagne 

In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing 

And I keep my cup wit me like a pimp 

I think I'm Magic Don Juan take a clip

Let them Birds take a bath

Watch it come out green

Let them Birds take a bath



I mean some birds in the shower dawg

Pass me the bounty dawg

Quick picker upper

Look at this motherfucker

His rhyme is a paper plate

I chop 'em like paper stakes

My life is a marathon

Cause I'm on the paper chase

My dog caught a paper case

He had too much paper on him

He said it was routine

I said they was waiting on him

Them fed they just chase the sack

Them J they just taste the crack

These dumb niggas chasing hoes

And me I'm chasing racks

Cause we offer fifty sacs

Fuck up bout thirty racks

Go drop me twelve bars

And get that there right back

My aunty say what's that smell

She said it is smellin' sour

I find it hard to believe

I just got 'em out the shower



[Hook:]

Birds take a bath

And then they come out clean

Birds take a bath

Watch it come out green

Birds take a bath

And if it come out clean

Birds take a bath

Watch it come out green

Birds take a bath



I just want the birds off

They cup all my phones off

They know how to clean them up

That fat one's a eagles nigger

The stash I was passing

Cook out some six kits

You know I got birds nigger

I get them for sea gropes

Clean them with remix

The bird bought me everything

The bird bought me diamond chain

Got brigs calling bird man

She bring me a cash money

Like Nipsey and Marathon

Yeah I'm on sugar front

I can't stop counting up

Them birds come every day

Plus I see them everywhere

Just send me a stork nigga

Get him the next day

Birds take a bath

I put a ride on the express way



[Hook:]

Birds take a bath

And then they come out clean

Birds take a bath

Watch it come out green

Birds take a bath

And if it come out clean

Birds take a bath

Watch it come out green

Put down that bus pass she got her some Porsche keys

Got her a Birkin bag, earrings for 40 G's

Sex keep on getting better, cause she keep getting wetter

Got her that sexy condo, nothing can separate us

When I'm in Chi-Town, I'm just a call away

Or on the West Coast, lost like I'm Marvin Gaye

I change a lot of streets, cause I got season
Keep it low key, you've got that cocaine in.
You street niggers snitching out for no reason,

All year round I call it jugg season.

I blend in good with the rich and famous,

But I will never change the game and I don't claim it.

You gotta change groups like you change clothes,

They take em in illuminati, know I can't go.

I don't even think before I make a move,

And I never leave the house without the tool

In the streets, nigger, you can win or lose,

I got bricks, I got bills, but I don't fuck with you.

Word on the street, a lot of niggers talking,

Imma work that jugg ass, imma keep on balling.

My trap phone, I got all the label calling,

Jugg on the other line want a Miami dolphin.

Put the label on hoe, now money talking,

I talk big money cause I'm about status,

Street first, rap second, that's just how I call it,

And you know I drink that lane like an alcoholic.

Keep it low key, you've got that cocaine in.

But I will never change the game and I don't claim it.

You gotta change groups like you change clothes,

They take em in illuminati, know I can't go.

Them niggers are sneaky, but we're still in,

Them niggers are greesy, but we're still working.

I grind every day like on steer hurting,

I'm in the booth recording a song while my nigger serving.

I took a couple niggers out, feel it was all worth,

Know I can go like the key on tec, nigger feel it.

Pour some purple in my cup, I call it purple rain,

I gotta watch out for these bitches trying to fuck for fame.

I'm trying to find different words for different days,

Nigger take fully loaded from a car that changed.

You really think I talk to the devil for the fame?

I'm bringing money up in there for everything I claim.

I change a lot of streets, cause I got season

Keep it low key, you've got that cocaine in.

You street niggers snitching out for no reason,

No longer can I remain earthbound
The future is now
Time and space are one in the same
Enough time in space and we running the game

Almost is unacceptable

The cosmos is a receptacle

For the spectacle of my ascension

Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective

All my actions selective

At all costs, I must obtain the objective

Regain the inception intended at the conception

A living lethal weapon

I'm the natural selection

Moving in my own eccentric orbit

A rebel amongst conformists

So far gone, you might catch me on Pluto

4 billion miles away

Do a whole week in one day

Live for keeping it real

You already know what it is

I rather ever speak without something to say

But if you can't remember the who, what, when, or the how

Remember one thing I said: the future is now"

I be telling him, he inspired me to go harder
Know what I'm saying, real talk

My savages, my savages, my savages
I’m always dressing fresher than a mannequin

I grew up in a ruthless ass environment

I’m on the phone with yo, I ask him how the trial went

35 racks is how my day was spent

I gotta cock it back, that’s how my day would get

You got me thinking all these bitches artificial

The way you acting you must don’t respect a real nigga

Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up

They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us

I told you way before what happened they was hating on us

You know when we was juuging for it they was mad at us

Aye, this a letter for my dogs

How we let the money get between us

How we let these bitches get between us

How we let these niggas get between us

I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers

I got love but it ain’t like the love I got for India

She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity

My lil dog caught a murder, gone for infinity

Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me

RIP my GrandDad Quick, he should have seen this shit

20 thousand O’s of child support, I seen that shit

Riding round with all them choppers, I done seen this shit

These rappers mad at me but these niggas ain’t doing shit

And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit

I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership

The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships

If Esco didn’t love me would’ve been done jumped ship

And it’s the love from my fans got me still here



Monster!

Say I’m Illuminati, they tryna make me catch a body



I don’t know when I'ma flip, nigga

Get me some codeine and sip, nigga

Big bank saying wipe a nigga’s nose, my girl changed the lock on the doors

Before this shit pour up a fo', ain't falling in love with no ho

That what you want for me? That what you really expect?

You thinking I’m sitting up depressed?

I'm somewhere countin' up me a check

I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that’s my only regret

Drag the mink on the floor

The Cuban links on my ho

Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?

Who would think we was poor?

There’s money laying on the floor

Got some hoes laying on some hoes

Got a shawty with me, she a pro

No she’ll never meet another nigga not another nigga like me

Even if he got a billion dollars he can’t make her cum like me

Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image

Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented

Because the Spurs weren't tinted, I told em ain't got nothing to hide

I told em I’ll do with the pies, told em fuck all of my roles, I don’t even write



My savages, my savages, my savages

We gone leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin

Free all my niggas incarcerated, you heard?

Loyal for life, you heard?

Thumbing through a check, boarding on the jet

Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the Styrofoam

That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown

We don't want it neva end

We don't want

We don't want it neva end

[Verse 1:]

I could tell you was into me, from my instant chemistry

As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me

I'll go to war over you I don't give a fuck about showing you

You know what it is, Shorty, forever my lil shawty

Long as I'm swimmin' in Benjamins, you shop with no limited

You'll see reminisce every session, know you'll come back again

I know you can't breath without me, you gon' need the oxygen

I damn near gave you an overdose, on my own medicine

I took a sip of your tea and I ain't been right ever since

As I think to myself what'd it have been heaven sent

And go far away where nobody can find us

I could see the haters comin' from a mile off

And it's preparin' us, for what we got comin'

If they come your way, and you feel like runnin'

Run in my direction, and don't you run from me

Cause anytime we get together, we gon stunt them

And I'm applyin' major pressure, feel it in your stomach

It's lightnin', it's thunderin', it is striking got me wonderin'

Is there anything you wanna know?

Is there any place you rather be?

You walk until your feet get sore

I bet you walking back

I bet you walking back to me

Actually that's a guarantee

Our friendship was guaranteed

You got my ego in another league

I ain't tryna be cocky

I got your heart in my pocket

And now I got my voice ... reminiscent around here

Got them chicks flipping for me, best friends kissing for me

Hey, magic city in the back room stripping for me

Your man is like next tale, soon gone

Falling (for you), falling (for you)

Falling for you, falling

I like her less, dude, while you move

You know your lesson, I don't ...

You don't ... a million

I'm falling for you here, I wanna see you blow!

I'm falling over here, you need a vocal coach!

I'm a sky ... five, four, three, two ...

Space rocket, we're out of here

You can't remember ...

You're strucking on my ego

You wanna go to Pluto, and make movies every day ...

Over night, one night with me, now we're shining!

Goin' through my tragedies, I practice like a athlete

Wouldn't believe they had for me

Show and prove, don't make believe

I'll make you believe, all my thoughts free

Privet in a large coat

This ain't no shit that I wrote

I've been down this road before

And I've been on the rollercoast'

So many ups and downs and turns

Homies droppin' like flies

Full strapped forty times

Doin' it like send the city guy

While I'm on the road, doin' shows, takin' this ride

They smoke crack right now, this ain't a Tyler beard

This be a about real life, it's very necessary

For me to go on in, so I went back in

Try to stay in this booth and never come out again

My lil' cousin called everybody and he's still fightin'

And I got killaz walkin' me 'broad, Future all they recitin'

And I can't forget you made me be a too much bide

But I ain't gon' hold no grudge, I just know your type

I take a trip a rapper give, run up there like MX Miff

Go to New York with this girl and I come back with a lip

Break bread with my team

Partner money here her

And confidence, I want my music global

I'm gonna see who bump their fist

I'm gonna change a nigga life

So he ain't gotta go through this

Don't get caught in my fit

Till I'm runnin' 1 0 6

They tracked me 'cross the globe

You can have the fame

Just give me my soul

I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat

Before I lose my respect

I stick to the code

I hold a tol on my shoulder

But I will never fall

No snitches allowed, case closed

Things changed for the better

No longer can I remain earthbound
The future is now
Time and space are one in the same
Enough time in space and we running the game

Almost is unacceptable

The cosmos is a receptacle

For the spectacle of my ascension

Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective

All my actions selective

At all costs, I must obtain the objective

Regain the inception intended at the conception

A living lethal weapon

I'm the natural selection

Moving in my own eccentric orbit

A rebel amongst conformists

So far gone, you might catch me on Pluto

4 billion miles away

Do a whole week in one day

Live for keeping it real

You already know what it is

I rather ever speak without something to say

But if you can't remember the who, what, when, or the how

Remember one thing I said: the future is now"

It's a cold-cold-cold world baby
Put on your coat

Preferably, check sure 'bout it

I didn't wanna lie to ya

But it sound more fly to ya

I didn't wanna lie to ya

I swear it sound way fly to ya

Cause the truth is gone hurt you

The truth gone hurt you

I swear the truth gonna hurt you

Truth gon' hurt you



I live a california lifestyle

All these girls around me, gone wild

And I'm so caught up in my own style

I can't see you niggas in the crowd

I'm so far, ain't gonna never come down

You can ask around, I run the town

Everyday for me, a fashion show

I'm Future in this and I run Pluto

I'm a rockstar forever, I need to get my act together

When changin' up the weather, it's so hard to be settle

Since we first got together

Things changed for the better

I got die hard fans and they treat me very special

Heard about forty bitches in the lobby

Ask me about it, hold nobody



[Hook]



Oh boy, the first class flight

Can't pack a bag over night

Cause I'm a shop when I land

Yea, I'm a shop when I land

When you playin' with them band

Five-sweet-o, to this all we stand

Don't frustrate

I been up late

(Just thinkin' of shxt you know what I mean)

Goin' over my plan

Feel like the second it's in

Too thangs you wouldn't understand

Under the hot light

Sex up in money

Everything we do we do it alway' to the money

I got a trio, tryna suck me up like Tito

Ain't fallin' in lust

You need to trust like I tell you

I could tell you was into me, from my instant chemistry

As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me

I'll go to war over you I don't give a fuck about showing you

You know what it is, Shorty, forever my lil shawty

Long as I'm swimmin' in Benjamins, you shop with no limited

You'll see reminisce every session, know you'll come back again

I know you can't breath without me, you gon' need the oxygen

I damn near gave you an overdose, on my own medicine

I took a sip of your tea and I ain't been right ever since

I could see the haters comin' from a mile off

And it's preparin' us, for what we got comin'

If they come your way, and you feel like runnin'

Run in my direction, and don't you run from me

Cause anytime we get together, we gon stunt them

And I'm applyin' major pressure, feel it in your stomach

Is there anything you wanna know?

Is there any place you rather be?

You walk until your feet get sore

I bet you walking back

I bet you walking back to me

Our friendship was guaranteed

You got my ego in another league

I got your heart in my pocket

[Verse 1: Future]

I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat

I come straight from the east, where niggas split your canteloupe

You tell me what you want of me I'm coming with a gang of dope

My cigar full of loud

I'm laced up to the fucking fo'

A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911

I do the whole dash, dropping all cash

Gutta to the death of me I'm sticking to the recipe

Slug, deal with Columbians, I know Sosa

All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the Roaches

Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofa's

The money got me heat, like I took a hit of coka

My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused



[Hook]



[Verse 2: Drake]

On the hood you see the Stallion

Passenger a stallion

Niggas getting nervous

I'm passing out the valium

I suggest you pop it

But please don't get too sleepy

Used to have them bitches twirkin'

Up in 400 West Peachtree

Bet ya those same hoes'll see me

Be like that's how you feeling

Used to stay up after 12

Now your worth like 12 million

Boy you did, boy you did it

You did the unexpected

I say fuck the unexpected

I just did what I projected

I swear young women are lost these days

While older women dig me

Fucking women that knew Biggie so

We really ain't no biggie

It's just OVO and XO and freebandz of committee

And shout out to Toronto

Bitch I'm Tony in my city

See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga I'll split yo tato

Ain't nothin' 'bout me ordinary, I come with the yayo

I move like I'm odd balls, it's gon take an army

The world is mine nigga u get it if u want it

You fuckin with me you'll move to Alaska by the mornin

You want me to be the bad guy, ok it's on then

I keep that same mentality when I was facing casualties

Goin' through my tragedies, I practice like a athlete

Wouldn't believe they had for me

Show and prove, don't make believe

I'll make you believe, all my thoughts free

Privet in a large coat

This ain't no shit that I wrote

I've been down this road before

And I've been on the rollercoast'

So many ups and downs and turns

Homies droppin' like flies

Full strapped forty times

Doin' it like send the city guy

While I'm on the road, doin' shows, takin' this ride

I just got to wear my ankle tracker, commit suicide

This the second time I'm goin' back in, the second time

You'll get a second chance at livin', nigga I ain't lyin'

[Verse 2:]

I gots the homies, they go hauntin' me, the world too

And they ain't comin' back home, they in the cemetery (rest in peace)

I wish I made this up, it was a fairytale

I know the kingpin's on, the name is Legendary

They smoke crack right now, this ain't a Tyler beard

This be a about real life, it's very necessary

For me to go on in, so I went back in

Try to stay in this booth and never come out again

My lil' cousin called everybody and he's still fightin'

And I got killaz walkin' me 'broad, Future all they recitin'

And I can't forget you made me be a too much bide

But I ain't gon' hold no grudge, I just know your type



[Hook]



[Verse 3:]

I take a trip a rapper give, run up there like MX Miff

Go to New York with this girl and I come back with a lip

Break bread with my team

Partner money here her

And confidence, I want my music global

I'm gonna see who bump their fist

I'm gonna change a nigga life

So he ain't gotta go through this

Don't get caught in my fit

Till I'm runnin' 1 0 6

They tracked me 'cross the globe

You can have the fame

Just give me my soul

I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat

Before I lose my respect

I stick to the code

I hold a tol on my shoulder

But I will never fall

No snitches allowed, case closed

Skeletons on my back

Benjamin's in my rags

Go spice up my comforts

Cause I'm a phrase on my eye

She clanking on movies now

So media they no surprised

Started in crack houses

Not really mansions

We're the finesse gang

We going to spend it

I talked to a crazy chick

I keep me a dog chick

I got me a combination

Bitches want freaky sex

A black and a white girl

Ah dominican cypher dey ain't nun

But sum dracular's suck me spectaular

There's a place to dance

People strictly dance

Birds take a bath

Watch it come out green

Let Them Birds take a bath (splash)

If the birds stay clean

They come out Charlie Sheen (winning)

They come out coop machines

They shoulda came with wings

How they flying in

Man I'm on that lean

In the house with green

In the house with yay

Man we need a mask

All these dope fumes (Don't sniff)

While we count this cash

Straight drop class

Put it in a freezer

Put it on a block

Give them J's a teaser

They gave my dope a name

They call this dope diesel

You need some gambino

You be fly like a eagle

We move them bands like cheetah

Get you a egg beater

And a half a square

Whip you a brick fair

I chop 'em like paper stakes

My life is a marathon

Cause I'm on the paper chase

My dog caught a paper case

He had too much paper on him

He said it was routine

I said they was waiting on him

Them fed they just chase the sack

Them J they just taste the crack

These dumb niggas chasing hoes

And me I'm chasing racks

Cause we offer fifty sacs

Fuck up bout thirty racks

Go drop me twelve bars

And get that there right back

My aunty say what's that smell

She said it is smellin' sour

I find it hard to believe

I just got 'em out the shower

The bird bought me diamond chain

Got brigs calling bird man

Plus I see them everywhere

Swapped out that ratchet how

Cause my bitch the baddest

Swapped out the recipe

Make my pockets fatter

Swapped out dem vv ones

Now I got better carots



I went psycho with dat sprite

I went a drug addict with dat sprite

I Got hoes dat like to dike

But to tell you the truth they fly like kites

I got bad bitches who write

Went to space and took a flight

Yeah I'm fly but ain't no kite

Cause they're too short for my life

I'm on Pluto

You on Earth

I had burberry at first

Now it's Pluto on my shirt

I don't go crazy

Had to maro hard top

Pull da rari with da vert

I'm the king in my hood

Aye da globe is my turf

See me rocking diamonds

You know the diamond's very bright

Had to swap out the mid

Then we start sellin white

I was true religion saggin

Now dem robins on me nice

Paid the cash in, cash now

All I do is swipe

I just brought a sprite and it's no longer clean

Was a true religion kid that I designed for my jeans

Hey I run ATL

Man I feel like a king

I'm red bottom walking when I walk on the fly

Rosalina popped a pill

Now I'm no longer tired

Marijuana in my system

You can see it on my eye

I've got a pocket full of hundred man

I feel like plies

I was old school shopping

Na da rari what matters

I once trip off light

Now I'm in Pluto forever

Yellow Stone, White Stone

Stepping up on my bezel

I vvs the face

Took out canary yellows



I swapped out my true religion

Put on my robin jeans

And game is full of madness

Love jacks

No more silo

I'm spiked up like a bad drink

Where all the scissile

Boy guillotine

I work hard and it came out

Our turf up

Turn the bitch off

Then I work through dead broke

To land up in a penthouse

There are no secret

When you leaking

I woke up the evening

And I seen the dim vie

I'm on that prickle danger

Trying to clear my thoughts

Nigger mown for my pain

All they see is fame

And with it brain

I paid dues

Graduated from finesse schools

I sold and proved

I never lose

I'm too smart

I should have win the hard one

Drinking at the border

Holding maseratti

Like a one time

Hey you niggers start hating on future

For one time



That ain't enough for you

I'm a sing a million rhyme

All the shit I've been through

I was grinding hard

Niggers trying to hold me back

They want to see what we can pluck

They want to see what we sack

I got it though

It worked out

I kept the lawyer

I sits den as

With no royal

Niggers try to chase paper

Then you got to take the slider screen up

Till we get screaming

I can sleep right

Then they put a hit on your head

Then you walk around with a price

Million ain't way what you see

I put spicer in my date

And I strapped her with the rental

Her chasing after paper

生まれ変われば僕にくれる？
本当？絶対だよ、忘れないで。」
両目が開いていてもふらついて
何でもないような顔してる
すり減っても良いなんて思わないけど

安心したいとまた手の鳴る方へ

いっそ宣戦布告しよう 首を締めるように

全部白状してしまおう 逃げ場もないように

偶像のなかでどうせ生きるなら

今すぐ名乗りを上げ さあ謳え

愛したいのも愛されるのも

生まれ変わった僕だ

どんな人にも触れさせはしない

ただありのまま欲望を晒して

その心ごと奪い取って

弾く旋律からTransmigration

そして君は僕を選ぶから

四六時中も息を殺し待っている

好奇心と言う餌にありつかせて

冗談だよと後付けたら 案外許されて

甘い言葉にのれるくらい

それくらいが良くて

見え透いていても 嫌いじゃないんでしょう

どこまで""ありのまま""を話そうか

""愛したい""のも""愛される""のも

生まれ変わった僕だ

「愛」と書き換えて呼び合うのなら

この感情も似たようなもの

同じカタチに作り変えて

時を満たす鐘が Transmigration

もっと君に嵌まっていたいよ

この告白に一つも偽りはない

だから傍にいてよ

愛したいのは愛されるのは

生まれ変わった僕だ

やっと待ち詫びた答えが聞ける

ただありのまま欲望を晒して

その心ごと奪い取って

弾く旋律から Transmigration

そして君を迎えに行くから

あざといほどの声で囁いてみて

大丈夫 たぶん悪い気しないから"

[Verse 1:]

Got a bankroll [?]

Dubbs I can letcha blow it right now uh? huh?

If everythang fell would run run through the rain, shine, thunderstorms

Would you fuck with the kid where I'm from... Gotta hold my bong, hold my gun

When days get tight and I come in sweaty, Would you kiss all over me with yo tongue

Would you ride for the kid, would you lie for the kid? Death before dis-honor

When I'm on the road doin shows from mississippi all the way to hong kong

And we made the bond that's ways beyond loui vuitton loui vuitton, don't wory bout the money, the money gone come (Racks!)

I just need to know these two questions

Would you ride for yo nigga {Ayee, whatchu lookin for}

If some things on my mind I need to get off

Can I come to you?

When I need to talk

If I ever get lost, can you help me find my way back to my vault

Would you cherish yo kid like you never had did

Could you love me? Could you love my kids?

Can you be there for me like you never had been

Like any relationship you ever been in

We make a connection that's full of affection

Can you hold me down, Knowin my profession

Will you wait for me patiently, tastefully

Will your loyalty lead to royalty

Can you answer these two questions please

Would you ride for yo nigga

That's all I wanna know

Would you die for yo nigga

A lot of the niggas we used to look up to, is lookin up to us now.
See that's that astronaut status, nigga.
DJ scream my nigga Future.

[Chorus:]

I'ma spaz on y'all. (astronaut nigga. Saluters respect that.)

We got to spaz on y'all, cuz a million mother fuckers wanna see me fall.

I'm the strength of my hood, I'ma spaz on y'all.

Got a real bad bitch come whenever I call.

It's so hard for me to trust her, I can't give her my all.

Got a gang of bitches in the club from wall to wall.

I'ma get em by the stage then I'ma spaz on y'all.

I'm bout to spaz on y'all.



I'm on my rockstar campaign, eyes it's ours boy.

Money just to burn, like a fire in a forrest.

Holding on a card trick, hundred page magazine.

Sippin on codeine so I can make my thoughts clean.

I swear if it ain't calm my nerves, I click on niggas. (click on niggas!)

I had a issue. (what?)

I'm too ambitious. (too ambitious!)

I paint the picture. (what?)

It's very vivid. (you see it?)

I play to guard the devil, don't get a hole in my spirit.

Try to wash my hands, I wash my hands, I had so much dirt on em. (whoa.)

I grind so hard. (hey.)

Now I'm hot as a sauna. (I'm hot!)

You'd rather see me suffer. (you'd rather see me suffer.)

My whole team under.

Applying major pressure.(on you niggas.)

With no conscience.

My body full of ganja.

The recipe, the farmers.

Don't make me put it on ya, I recollect your memory.

Finessing was a sport, then I turned it to a business.

This ain't one LBG forever, get the fuck up out my business.

That crack house life, (life!) it will teach you something you can't even witness.

Or listen to, you gotta go through.

Feel it in your kidney.

She wishing, and it's my only chance.

And I got bitches, they come in on command.

No remote control, on demand.

You wanna see me win? I go Taliban.

Ape shit behind the free band logo.

We go loco on that coco, I put that on my migo.

We got to spaz on y'all, (why?) cuz a million mother fuckers wanna see me fall. (I know.)

I'ma get em by the stage then go spaz on y'all.

I'm bout to spaz on y'all.



The planet ice sphere made me colder than Ohio.

I get headaches everyday but you can't tell how hard I go.

I'ma give it to you real, ain't no excuses I'm making.

One word gets you through the bad days, having patience.

They don't have no idea, how the haters try to interfere and steal what you done built up.

To this point in your career.

When you riding in the rairri, swerving through traffic with your diamonds.

It's one word, gliss, cuz all your shit is is remindement.

Bad karma, I put in when I was grinding.

Hustle hard, taking money, it's called surviving.

Down bat, take your anger, then you can bind it.

I go to the booth with them thoughts, then start rhyming.



[Chorus:]

We got to spaz on y'all, (why?) cuz a million mother fuckers wanna see me fall. (I know.)

We made a promise to each other we'd never end ...

she gone be there for the kid, no matter what

No matter what, no matter what, yeah



We met through a mutual friend

We started clubbing, dranking, talking, laughing and grinning

You had your eyes on me the whole time, 

I could see ya through my lens

Your face your shape and the lil things about ya...had the kid all in

Anytime we spend time, we spend more than we spend benjamins

But the fuck this high siddity girl want to do with an astronaut kid...

Or asking myself questions, I had to understand...

You gotta live and learn to make mistakes to be the man

We didn't mean for it to get this serious...

I got another nigga bitch with me

And I'm falling for her, yeah I'm falling for her

We ain't got no strings attached 

I want her more and more

No matter what, no matter what, yeah



We can talk about whatever, we can fuck whenever

It's like we're walking on rose petals, when we together ...

I see you jocking me, and I'm jocking you harder...

You got everything a woman want, I still want to spoil ya

And your loyalty to him ain't my concern cause you're loyal

It's like we been casted with a spell or both ate some poison

Tell him I ain't mean to intervene with his main thing

You my main fling, I took it main stream

Everyday its nice to share our main dreams, and ain't a damn thing...

Will never come between, our thing

And we ain't mean for it to be this serious...

I made a promise to you and I'ma take it serious

Cause I know my words mean the most to you

And you mean the most to me

We got a special relation, can't nobody come between



We made a bond from the very beginning

I found my homey and my best friend

Imma be there for ya till the very end, 

No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, yeah

We broke the rules, we took it further in

We made a promise to each other we'd never end ...
