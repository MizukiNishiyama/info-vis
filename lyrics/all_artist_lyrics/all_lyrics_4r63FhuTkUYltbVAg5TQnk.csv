I see the way they mug, ain't finna' stay with you niggas
You know I stay down like a thug, I climbed the stairs with my niggas
They like ""Baby, come get yo' spot"", I'll be right there in a minute, I'll be right there in a minute
It's all good you know I gotta' take the heart away, but that's the way it go we don't let 'em come and take yo' heart away
Or let 'em take your soul away

It go down I'm a slang, I'mma' drop my nuts and let 'em hang

My daughters a family, I already know the play

Sippin' on this tequila, tryna' imagine what my bro would say

Caught up inside of the media, sitting there laughing, nigga I know you ain't

Thinking it won't go down about my struggle

Thinking it won't go down about my struggle, nigga I know you ain't

I can damn near walk in that bitch with my eyes closed, nigga, I know the bank

I'mma' give you the real thing every time, ain't no need to overthink

Ready to go through whatever, I know they don't understand the way a solider think

Nigga probably had too much dip on his chip, probably ain't know his rank

Get you out contact, let you finish your sentence and sit there and know it's fake

The repo' man came and took a car, guess the note was late

Don't say that, nuh-uh, I hope it ain't

Know I got your back and later you gon' tell 'em fuck me, like I ain't over play

I'm the typa' nigga know you really need it, I'mma' go and do it anyway

You ever ride for a nigga, die for a nigga and they ever fell away

And never even feel the need to even come and talk to you they just drift away

I'mma' run it nigga, pick a play

Hold it up like what my riches say

Fuck that nigga like my bitches say, fuck that nigga like my bitches say?

Just look at my eyes I done been through some shit, that's probably what my picture say

Scared to hold my head up and let you see the real me cause' I been thuggin', baby

Want you to know that I appreciate the way you make me feel, I know you love me, baby

Hold me closer when you fuck me, baby, hold me closer when we fucking, baby



I'mma' need you to go put a Draco on your name and never report it stolen

Make you look over your shoulder, all of their face, whenever you bust it open

I don't like your friends, fuck your homies

Say it two times, fuck your homies

Say it three times, fuck your homies, yeah, yeah, yeah



It's hard to not use my hands, like I'm a man, when you sitting there suckin' on me

It's hard not to love this bitch when I'm out here thuggin', ain't no one loving on me

I don't like your friends, fuck your homies

Say it two times, fuck your homies

Say it three times, fuck your homies, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wear my losses, I don't care if I'm winning

They won't see me on the top, I'll be back there in a minute

Did everything straight from the heart, they see me stand on the business

We won't see you back on the charts, I'll back there in a minute, I'll be back there in a minute



It's all good, you know I gotta' take a stiff away

They ever shut you off, you better go and find a different way, or go and find another way

Fuck these niggas, no, none of these niggas love me just like my brother say

Gotta' watch who you sit and call your friend that's what my mother say

Then go right back and be there to save 'em, just like my mother do

My heart too big and that's why niggas always playing, it's all because of you

Always get back home safe because you always praying, it's all because of you, praying it's all because of you"

Fuck these niggas, keep that pistol hidden, take his head off

I got the game from my momma, stay chasing them commas

I'ma get me a hundred then I'm heading out

Shorty thick with that ass, but I'm filling her mouth

Take the plate off that car off that window, come out

Talking shit, so a nigga aim straight for his mouth

I done went to Utah and I'm straight from that Nawf

I went tatted a diamonds on top of my face

You just raisin' the break up, that heart on a plate

Microwave or the stove do it either way

Put on my mask and I seize the place

Smokin' joc' back-to-back, I don't need to bake

Talkin' crazy I said I don't need you bae

Need a hunnid on hunnid, I don't see that shit fake

Only scent leave a hunnid, I'm raising him red

Patek, two tones, bought a bracelet with pointers

Hit the jeweler, I told him the M on my chain

His name in vain, he coming from kickin' in doors and selling that cain

Right hand with the gelatin, everything changed

Quitted then upgraded straight to the stage

I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent

And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey

Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah

My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah

We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman

Fool me one time, you can't cross me again

Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind

If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin

Maybach SUV for my refugees

Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets

I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station

Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day

But they ain't even want no smoke

If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

OK, huh take my phone, baby

Let's go



I'm just a lil' nigga from Charlotte, the biggest new artist

They wanna see me up the road, but my lawyer a fool with dismissing the charges

You know BDB ENT we gone pull up Infiniti's, Challengers, Chargers

And no, we don't gotta get money with you, bitch we gone get money regardless

I'ma let you do all of that talking, don't get me started, you know I'ma stop it

And I don't got a cent for a hoe, she bringing up money, I'm changing the topic

She need to be talking about sucking some dick, I nut in her mouth and she gargle

If she spit out that rich nigga shit without swallowing, me and her having some problems

We having revolvers strictly for murder and plenty of pistols and choppas

Aye, when you gone stop? Whenever the fat lady sing, I don't listen to opera

You know how I give it up, fucked around, fucked up my hand beat a nigga up

Pull off on a nigga like 'Vroom', he don't got a car he still catching the city bus

His baby mama unemployed so she in the club with her ass and her titties out

And we done robbed so many plugs, you better check and go ask what my city 'bout

Had to slide the nigga bitch a dub, wanted to fuck me but I only hit her mouth

Take the palm of my hand, slap me a nigga, got something to say, make em' spit it out

You know I'm 'bout Baby, all the shit the nigga rapping 'bout, that nigga really 'bout

And no, I ain't taking advice from a nigga, I'm cool on that, I got it figured out

These niggas be crying about petty shit, I can't relate because I took a bigger loss

And these niggas know I been a boss, ever since Rick Ross was the biggest boss

Got diamonds all over my teeth, I been eating chicken, I need me some dental floss

Hold my watch in the air, it's no longer hot, you can go turn that condition off

I'm hitting this hoe on the low, she fuck with me hard, she say that her nigga soft

Why you talking so low? 'Cause' if a nigga find out and he try me, I'm knocking a nigga off

I'm riding pass twelve, flying through fast as hell, flicking a nigga off

I'm revving the gas, burning out on niggas ass, I'm showing my engine off



Straight off the rip, you know I don't wait for the drop

I go out to eat with my kids and my mama, you know I ain't dating no thot

(He took my bitch in Nike, I'm rocking designer clothes)

I told her, ""Sorry I'm not fucking, baby, I'm not a hoe""

Had bitches knocking at my door like they was dominoes

They gone say I went 'Pop'



Until a nigga play with me and he get popped

I'm on front row at BET without my Glock

I'm ready to beat a nigga up like I'm The Rock

And she ready to sweep a nigga up because he hot

She ready to eat a nigga up until he lock

She hit the brakes and speed it up like she a car

Now she got her hands behind her head like I'm a cop, huh

I told her fuck the police, yeah



Taking a trip to Mexico, I'm coming right back to town

I sell a lot of perico, been tryna slow it down

Takin' a fo', I put a two on that and then I make it bounce

I took the thirty-six to a hundred-eight and weigh up every ounce

I'm a plug, working a drug hub out in H-town

Bae what up, you my lil' love bug, you with Gates now

Penetrate, while I grip her waist, push her face down

Concentrate, boom, this that base, making grave sounds

Got a graveyard up under my belt, more murders than New Mexico

Thirty-round extension, mini-glizzy and I'm surgical

I'm holding rank in the cartel, I got control in this bitch

Still a book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch

Bread winner, don dada, bitch, we Puerto Rico gangland

A hundred bricks ain't nothing, I push the button and make the plane land

Showed some of you niggas how to grind up out the whole

Then I tied you in with 'migo then I gotcha another low



Yeah, he just told you how to 'Pop'

Until a nigga play with me and he get popped

I'm on front row at BET without my Glock

I'm ready to beat a nigga up like I'm The Rock

And everybody wondering why he come around and don't say nothing

('Cause' he be so alone, it's been so long, I can't feel nothing)



Let me pop my shit

I came from shit, three of us and my mom, she couldn't pay rent

Two jobs, all alone, she couldn't quit

We was home alone when we was jits

That's before I was grown, before I was on

I ain't have no shoes, I ain't have no clothes

Let me wear your shoes, let me fuck your bitch

I ain't have no car, I ain't have no whip

Wonder why a nigga cover his ears when y'all talk

'Cause' it ain't nobody that can tell me shit

I just spent 30K on my daughter birthday

Everybody had fun, nigga everybody lit

When a nigga go home, I don't answer my phone

Everybody wanna leach, everybody want a loan

Everybody wanna talk, everybody wanna click

I don't wanna be friends, nigga get off my dick

I ain't have time to think, I ain't have time to breathe

I been praying to the Lord, I been talking on my knees

I been thinking bout my pops, I been thinking bout my opps

Thinking how I can stop me a nigga when he breathe

When a nigga play with me, I ain't looking for my phone

I ain't finna drive away, I ain't looking for my keys

The fuck these niggas know about me?

Like I abandoned the race

And you ran in my place

Shoes too big but they use hair strands as a lace, and they break

When it's hot outside, you don't want fans in your face

When you might want a fan in your face

When ya man got a heat and a hand on the waist (Band)

Gotta keep a cool head, niggas got PTSD these days

Some folks ain't live to see these days

I be in the lab like Dex, coolin', taking these Dee Dee breaks

Long, the PD way, I can write a book like TD Jakes

Walking around my city in some house shoes

Know they always wanted someone they could honk and shout too

Just gotta remember got a family and a house too

Don't get caught up with the one that's still function without you

It ain't right how they all went left on me

Niggas took my heart and they stepped on it

Lately, I've been hanging by myself, homie

These fuck niggas make me sick, they got my nauseous

Paranoid, all this money moving cautious

Flipping quarters on the corner to a baller

Run up on Gucci, you gone see the coroner

Bright carrots in my chest, not pointers

Paris fashion week fresh like a foreigner

Nigga tried to rob me now he a goner

Gucci Mane preach that Gospel to the mourners (Wop)

I got the number one record, they acknowledged the jit (Ayy, yo, Kid)
They goin' crazy when they play it, head bobbin' and shit
And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami

I was out there with the family

Just lookin' at my daughter

Thinkin' to myself like, ""Damn, my baby look just like my daddy""

Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up

That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick

Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch

And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click

I'm tryna send somebody wit' him

Somebody let me know what's happenin'

My last name K-I-R-K, Kirk

You know how I rock behind my daddy

You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family

How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?

How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?

I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali

What you know you smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?

I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'

I got some questions, I'm a die about respect if I don't get answers

My mama stood up in that chair, took it like a G when she had cancer

My brother be thinkin' that we don't love him and let him struggle like we ain't family

Like I won't give up all I got to see you happy, nigga

We shocked the world, everybody know what's happenin', nigga

I'm still Lil' Jon Jon, my song, it just went platinum, nigga

We on our own time, let's go move out to Cali, nigga

Put the kids in homeschool, let's go get us a mansion, nigga

Let's raise our kids right, let's watch the shit we teach 'em, nigga

Let's start a business for you so they can't say that you leechin', nigga

How I know I'm the chosen one, 'cause sometimes when I be speakin', nigga

Like on this song, I ain't rappin', I'm preachin', nigga



If I love you, then I need ya (Let's go)

I fuck with you like Martin fuck with Gina (Uh)

We family like we Venus and Serena (Hey)

Let's go get married like we thank God and Kanisha (Okay)

Don't give a fuck about the world, just 'bout my people (Facts)

I don't care what the fuck they told you, we ain't equal (Uh-uh)

Niggas ain't cut from the same cloth, these niggas see-through (Ayy)

And I be too busy doin' me to see what he do, nigga



Yeah, verse two, that lil' nigga from the other side (Uh-huh)

And I do it myself, whenever I ride, you know that my brothers ride (Okay)

And I still got a lotta shit on my mind that I can't undecide (Yeah, yeah)

Got me ready to slide, feelin' like Doe Boy when his brother died (Boyz n the Hood)

You know how I step, you know how I rep, you know about Baby, nigga (You know about Baby)

You know how I'm comin' back for that cross if you ever play me, nigga (Get back)

You know how I got it up out the mud and turned it to gravy nigga (Huh)

And hit the rap game like crack cocaine in the '80s, nigga



Fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout, bruh? Like... (Oh my God, oh)

Look (Oh my God)
