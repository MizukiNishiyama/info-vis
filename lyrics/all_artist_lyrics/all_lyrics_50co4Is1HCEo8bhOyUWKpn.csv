Barely check my account, nigga I'm admittin' it (I don't give a fuck)

Fuck around with my bread, bet you I'ma find out (I'ma catch a nigga)

Couple niggas, I doubt it, know what I'm talkin' about

Nigga don't play with me, I got a wife, I got a baby to feed

I got a momma to support, I got a brother, got a few legal fees

I got a daddy and shit, medical bills, credit to fix, people to pay, label to run

You play with your life or you play with my funds, nigga

I've been stressin' 'cause I still ain't buy my dad a house (Stressin')

I've been stressin' 'cause my girl said ""We can't work it out""

I know some people that start sinnin' as soon as church get out

And I don't think like I used to think, 'cause I'm older now

When you broke, you doin' more for less

You ain't findin' no success

Sad to say my girl just left, and I really love her to death

Told her I can't call her my ex, 'cause I feel like we ain't finished yet

I just text her phone and I said ""Are you out your feelings yet?""

And my brother, he just called and he need that lawyer money

They said he did it, but I know he didn't

But you need O.J. money when you tryna get acquitted (Yeah)

This shit is sickenin', no one listen when you in prison

I was hangin' on the corner, I had some Jordan's on, no designer

Servin' up that white girl, back then we call her ""Fine China""

I was lookin' for a bad bitch, but didn't know where to find her

All this pressure and this stress make me a diamond

I'm just tryna show love, some people never grow up

Sometimes I wish I could trust, but that's how feelings get crushed

I used to ride on the train, I used to ride on the bus

They wanna hang with the gang, but they not one of us"

Pullin' up three or four deep, that heat, we gotta tuck us one

Sendin' shots 'til my Glock shrink

I threw it, tryna duck and run and re-up on another one

Stop, had to wait and think, remember pops said not to do

Opps, they duck or get hit, we leave hollows inside of you

Glock, had to tote the stick, I grew up unreliable

They never told me how to move

Don't wanna hear, ""I'm proud of you""

Mama said ain't healthy

I been on my own too long, there's nothing you can tell me

If I don't know anything, I know that's still gon' help me

They tellin' me different things, so I gotta be stealthy

Put my pain in my lyrics 'cause I know niggas feel me

I can't love a bimbo, 'cause these hoes out here be filthy

Mama, I'ma make it, this for you, I hope you hearin' me

And fuck cross-relations, shout out to my fuckin' family, yeah



Opps out with vengeance, they swearin' they don't know who did it

Growin' up, they told us flexin', but all we know is extensions

My Glock sit like an erection, that bitch poke when he experience

Foenem told me to stay down 'til I'm up, thank God I listened

Now they proud, but from a distance, they showin' love from a distance

In my city, bein' broke is fake, if you up, they gon' listen

In my city, can't talk to the jakes, another disappearance

They done took lil' Jake, gave him a grave, done told that boy to listen

Now they out searchin' for bodies, got doctors doin' autopsies

It ain't my place to make a statement, but I'm not just anybody

It ain't my place to re-embrace shit, but my heart cold, no tsunami

I really know niggas who know niggas who take souls from bodies (Yeah, yeah)



Lifetime revenge, do you trust me?

He won't come outside, so they killed him in the lobby

Rockin' all white, turnin' red, you think you godly

Federales lookin', but they can't find the body

Look at CNN, niggas droppin' like flies, oh

They gon' keep a grudge, they don't let bygones be bygones

Crazy I had to go to jail just to read the Bible

I told niggas, ""Keep it trill,"" but they don't speak English

I could kill a nigga today like a half a mil' ain't on my wrist

If she play with my name, we gon' have a funeral for my bitch

I could take shit to the grave, I never seen no one get flipped

Pillow talkin' the violations, like a chip, you can get dipped

Got these labels tryna sell me

Tryna see my kids every day because it's healthy

Talkin' to my brother, he had a phone in the jail

He say he just paid a thousand for a knife from my celly

Spent a half a ticket



Opps out with vengeance, they swearin' they don't know who did it

Growin' up, they told us flexin', but all we know is extensions

My Glock sit like an erection, that bitch poke when he experience

Foenem told me to stay down 'til I'm up, thank God I listened

Uh, yeah
Opps out with vengeance, they swearin' they don't know who did it
Growin' up, they told us flexin', but all we know is extensions
My Glock sit like an erection, that bitch poke when he experience

Foenem told me to stay down 'til I'm up, thank God I listened

Now they proud, but from a distance, they showin' love from a distance

In my city, bein' broke is fake, if you up, they gon' listen

In my city, can't talk to the jakes, another disappearance

They done took lil' Jake, gave him a grave, done told that boy to listen

Now they out searchin' for bodies, got doctors doin' autopsies

It ain't my place to make a statement, but I'm not just anybody

It ain't my place to re-embrace shit, but my heart cold, no tsunami

I really know niggas who know niggas who take souls from bodies



We made it known, they knew what's up with us

To the point where we ain't speak and everybody fuck with us

Pullin' up three or four deep, that heat, we gotta tuck us one

Sendin' shots 'til my Glock shrink

I threw it, tryna duck and run and re-up on another one

Stop, had to wait and think, remember pops said not to do

Opps, they duck or get hit, we leave hollows inside of you

Glock, had to tote the stick, I grew up unreliable

They never told me how to move

Don't wanna hear, ""I'm proud of you""

Mama said ain't healthy

I been on my own too long, there's nothing you can tell me

If I don't know anything, I know that's still gon' help me

They tellin' me different things, so I gotta be stealthy

Put my pain in my lyrics 'cause I know niggas feel me

I can't love a bimbo, 'cause these hoes out here be filthy

Mama, I'ma make it, this for you, I hope you hearin' me

And fuck cross-relations, shout out to my fuckin' family, yeah



Opps out with vengeance, they swearin' they don't know who did it

Growin' up, they told us flexin', but all we know is extensions

I really know niggas who know niggas who take souls from bodies (Yeah, yeah)



Lifetime revenge, do you trust me?

He won't come outside, so they killed him in the lobby

Rockin' all white, turnin' red, you think you godly

Federales lookin', but they can't find the body

Look at CNN, niggas droppin' like flies, oh

They gon' keep a grudge, they don't let bygones be bygones

Crazy I had to go to jail just to read the Bible

I told niggas, ""Keep it trill,"" but they don't speak English

I could kill a nigga today like a half a mil' ain't on my wrist

If she play with my name, we gon' have a funeral for my bitch

I could take shit to the grave, I never seen no one get flipped

Pillow talkin' the violations, like a chip, you can get dipped

Got these labels tryna sell me

Tryna see my kids every day because it's healthy

Talkin' to my brother, he had a phone in the jail

He say he just paid a thousand for a knife from my celly

Spent a half a ticket



Opps out with vengeance, they swearin' they don't know who did it

Growin' up, they told us flexin', but all we know is extensions

Put it right in her throat

And you know I stay with them AKs and I should've caught em

(You already...)

All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill

I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills

I might tell the whole crew come through

My squad gotta roll through come through

Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'

Because they sure do come true

Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit

This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit

Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit

And like you just got traded

Girl you don't know who you're playin' with

Oh yeah, oh yeah, my sound is what up right now

I've been down, but I'm up right now

Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'

Through that lane that you left open

Man I don't give a fuck right now

Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low

'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla



I don't know what it was about you

Like blue you left me without a clue

(I pictured the fate, is it true?)

Cause I try to make this shit work

(But it seems like is it your feelings

You kept them hatin' bitches all in our business)

But I just got one question baby:

Tell me why?



Started from the bottom like Drake said

You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead

My squad'll kick in your door where that safe at

No Atari, games girl I don't play that

If she broke I don't acknowledge her, everything I say I follow up

What you talkin' 'bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up

Drippin' on these hoes

Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us

Made a little money, still ain't got enough

And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up

Eyes open, don't say nothin'

Motor geeked up like a razor

You don't know me, you must mistake me

For somebody else

But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with

Your ex nigga, fuck him

I had to tell her that



I don't know what it was about you

Like blue you left me without a clue

(I pictured the fate, is it true?)

Cause I try to make this shit work

(But it seems like is it your feelings

You kept them hatin' bitches all in our business)

But I just got one question baby:

Tell me why?



Question, baby, tell me why

One question, baby, tell me why"

I just spent your salary

Walked inside of the exhibit and bought the gallery (Uh, uh-huh)

I'm so wealthy, I done bought out on my cavities (Uh-huh)

Havin' sex with your old lady, I lost calories (Uh-huh)

Rich shit, I'm playin' Louis ping-pong with my bestie (Uh)

Made a TV show with some lesbians (Uh-huh)

Like the TV show, I done next'ed (Uh)

G-Star, pull your thorns out your carat

Bought my dawg a new kenel, it's a palace

Hunnid fortune, and the winners wanna bash me (Slatt, slatt, slatt)

I rock minks when it ain't December 'cause my diamonds

Women lie and men lie, but not this money (Bitch, bitch)

I'm a realer, call Coachella, tell 'em I'm comin' in Margiela

I don't like her, I can't sweat her, I just come and keep it mellow

Your boyfriend like, ""Ooh, she came""

Went and took her anyway

Now he want his girl back

Fuck you, have a nice day (Yeah)

Burberry on my coat

If it's a problem, I'm pulling up ten-four

Walk in his house, smoke a nigga like endo

Percocet popper, don't fuck with the benzos

Party in the brib, pick a line for the info

Murder every nigga, murder every instrumental

They not my kinfolk

They finna get fucked up when I hop out the Benz like Rambo, uh

Shit, I made the devil dance

Leanin' all over this song, don't think I stand a chance

Separate my rights from my wrongs, to never be wrong again

But I'm DJ Khaled with it all 'cause all I do is win

It's ya boy yo gotti
Chea
Gucci mane the flare

My nigga Ralph in here

Zaytoven on the beat nigga

And it's a street nigga holiday

My Nigga D.J Holiday

Chea



[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

Bricks

All white bricks

Off white bricks

Light tan bricks

Just hit a lick, For 50 more bricks

Balling like a bitch, with all these bricks

Bricks

36 zips

That's a whole chick

Wanna bad bitch? Gotta have bricks

Yea that make sense

Yea I make hits

But I still take bricks



[Verse 1: Gucci mane]

So icy c.e.o, I'm a fool with the snow

They think I'm puttin' v.v.s jewels in the coke

My watch a cool hundred, Paint-job a cold 20

And after this flip I'm quittin' the trap cold turkey, Sike!

The pack in and I'm workin'

Drought season in, charged ya ass a whole 30

But right now you can get it for a low number

The fish scale white, Same color my hummer

Zone 6 polar bears never see summer

It's winter all year cause the birds fly under

95' Air Max cause I'm a dope runna'

I'm ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper I'ts



[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

Bricks

All white bricks

Off white bricks

Light tan bricks

Just hit a lick

For 50 more bricks

Balling like a bitch, with all these bricks

Bricks

36 zips

That's a whole chick

Wanna bad bitch? Gotta have bricks

Yea that make sense

Yea I make hits

But I still take bricks



[Verse 2: Young Ralph]

I'm like a waitress in the trap I got somethin' to serve

That's 16 bars, Same price for a bird

What you need a bird?

Or A Couple Pounds?

I'm on Cleveland Ave, You know my side of town

So many bricks I can build my own apartment

Ya better a check, When ya come in my department

Yes I break em' down

And I sell em' whole, Try me watch ya whole crew fall like some dominoes

I got a trap house

And a trap car

100, 00 off a cap, That's a trap star

All this smoke got me feelin' real nauseous

Ridin' with them bricks got me feelin' real cautious



[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

Bricks

All white bricks

Off white bricks

Light tan bricks

Just hit a lick

For 50 more bricks

Balling like a bitch, with all these bricks

Bricks

36 zips

That's a whole chick

Wanna bad bitch? Gotta have bricks

Yea that make sense

Yea I make hits

But I still take bricks



[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]

Tony Montana, All I have in this world

Is my 100 round chopper and my white girl

Oil base bricks, Shit hard to cook

Call the plug back, Tell him he got took

Know what that mean? The shit free

That mean none for him, And more for me

I took somethin', I'm gutta bitch

Don't trust me dog, This that North Memphis shit

Old school, New Porsche

Couple choppas just in case they wanna go to war bricks

A.k.a my best friend

28 inch rims call em' grown men

Dope stepped on, Call it step child

I got that Slim Shady, We call it 8 Mile

I'm from North Memphis, Watkins and Brown

Gotti Street, And nigga that's my brick house



[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

Bricks

All white bricks

Off white bricks

Light tan bricks

Just hit a lick

For 50 more bricks

Balling like a bitch, with all these bricks

Bricks

36 zips

That's a whole chick

Wanna bad bitch? Gotta have bricks

Yea that make sense

Yea I make hits

But I still take bricks"

Ass soft as jelly

He got them birds in the '

Thugger let your bitch suck him in rentals

Call me with the deal life fucking pickle,yeah

Bitch and how we went in every night before the grubbing

I'm talking about a little money

I was getting

Before 18 way before the clubbing

Now I got my sack right ,nigga

Still in the trap house kitchen

Let some of money come up missing

Fuck around ,slap the shit out of all these niggaz

Trap house bumpin' got all these pistols

My nigga Thug rich broke doin' all that whippin'

And I got a 44,I ain't got call no killer

More money,more problems

I can solve that issue

If it's off my hip Ima pull that motherfucker back just like a sling shot

And you ain't hold your homie down like you suppose to

Cause he ain'y never been heard of a green dot

He ain't got all that shit he say

He ain't about rappers trying to beat his way

Please,boy,I see folks trying to take pictures so I'm like hold up,wait

Freeze boy!
