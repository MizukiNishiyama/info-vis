And don't give a fuck what's in my rearview
Ain't about to tell you what I been through
All I wanna know is what you into
What we gettin' into?
Yeah, we fin' to make this continue

So what's on the menu?

Got love everywhere that we went to

Gettin' chased by the aunties

She still actin' like a dime piece

She still actin' like the '90s

Didn't have to remind me

See, I used to be grimy, now I'm so polished

Didn't go to college, still got the knowledge

Still got the wallet to make that deposit

Get your bitch ass back in the closet

West Coast flow like a faucet

Nigga drop game like I lost it

This ain't for you, this is bullshit

I'm on La Brea by the carpet

Dinosaur mash on the gas

Real players got to brush off the ash

Why the real ones don't last?

Why the real ones gotta pass?

Missin' you every day

Repeat all the shit that you used to say

Ran across your picture in my iPhone (iPhone)

Boy, you was wild as a cyclone (Cyclone)

Kinda like me with the mic on (Mic on)

Grab the shit tight like a python (Python)

Spit that ism, and if they really listen

You know this ism'll keep them out of prison

You know this ism'll keep you on a mission

Time to start livin' and stop wishin'

The sky is purple and pink

And I think that the moon gave a nigga a wink



Rollin' at twilight

Gettin' ready for the nightlife

Me and my real ones (Me and my real ones)

We about to make a highlight

Rollin' at twilight (Rollin' at twilight)

Gettin' ready for the nightlife

Me and my real ones (Me and my real ones)

We about to make a highlight



It's a get-together, takin' flicks together

Playin' dominoes, we can sit forever

Talkin' that shit, Jordan to Kobe

Lightin' a stogie, countin' the trophies

Friends and family, ones that can't stand me

'Cause they say I act too manly

Well, that's just me

I'ma tell it like it is, I'ma call what I see



Rollin' at twilight

Gettin' ready for the nightlife

Me and my real ones (Me and my real ones)

We about to make a highlight"

Is this happiness? Nigga, fuck no
But I'm slapping this in your mouth, though
With a heave-ho, you a deep throat
West Coast, bitch, it's the dosage

I can't overdose on no hoe shit

I minister this pimp shit

I've been a minister since an infant

I was Kendrick before Kendrick

Rock and roll Hall of Famer, like Jimi Hendrix

So you can vomit on that bullshit

Or you can choke on your own spit when your boy's in the pulpit

Try to rob my church, I'ma rob you first

I'ma do the funeral and drive your hearse

I'ma hug your momma 'for I steal her purse

I'ma hunt your bitch 'cause I'm the curse

Check my verse, in rеverse

He spazzing out, go gеt the nurse

She passing out from vast amounts of ass to mouth

I'm cashing out, bitch



They know

It's my ego

All you hoes (All you hoes)

You know (You know how it go)

It's my ego (Yeah, huh)



This is cuzz, and happiness

So tell Al Green to pass the grits

A bag of bitch, I got a bag of tricks

Looks like you got hit with a bag of dicks

This right here is the master mix of bloods and crips

So don't resist

I'll smack your ass, like Will did Chris

Give a demonstration in front of the nation (Smack!)

I ain't playing

If I had to leave your motherfucking ass right where you land (Smack!)

Leave me alone

You might live longer if you mind your own

Watch your tone

I'm too damn grown for this shit

Sticks and stones? Well, i'ma pick the stick

And crack your ass

You need a maxi pad

To stop that blood coming out your gash, punk



They know

It's my ego

All you hoes (All you hoes)

You know (You know how it go)

It's my ego (Yeah, huh)



Everybody say ""drop the attitude""

But y'all shouldn't worry about what daddy do

Y'all should worry about what kids do

I'm a cold motherfucker

Get out my igloo

The CEO with a E-G-O

Can pick any flow, eeny, miny, moe

And body you bitches, make y'all religious

I'm here to fight reptiles and lizards

Motherfucker, it's the grand wizard

I take they shit

Wipe my ass, then I flip it

I break they shit, like when your cousins come visit

And then I tell them fuck your analytics

I don't pivot

I give it to you vivid

If you's a bigot

You probably won't dig it

If you's a hoe

You'll probably get triggered

Like one of these internet bitches



They know

It's my ego

All you hoes (All you hoes)

You know (You know how it go)

They used to call these ""nigga words""

So what the fuck are ""trigger words""?

Words like his and hers?

What's a pronoun and a verb?

Follow this then you follow back

Then you swallow this and swallow that (Swallowed it)

Then you go have a heart attack

And don't blame it on the vaxx

(Da da da da) I put it on wax

Some Blacks hate when you talk about facts

But you can talk about racks

You can talk about twerkin', but not a nigga workin'

Everything ain't urban

Just like this motherfucking whip that I'm swervin' (Let me ride)

So here's what a ho should know

Don't be so emotional

Nasty or nice, put it on ice

It don't matter, what's your vice?

Take my advice, cut me a slice

Seven or eleven when you roll these dice

Make your ass yell ""Jesus Christ""

Middle of the day, middle of the night

Cause in the streets, that's where they lay ops

On the other side of the planet

Got a phonе call, homies in a panic

God damn it, what happened?

Niggas startеd fightin', but then, niggas started yappin'

I went to court out-port

Had to make sure, I didn't have warrants (Damn)

No snitchin' to say the least

Saw the beast, leave my nigga piece by piece

Even though he didn't do it, the police, the DA, the judge all knew it

He still walked off twenty, now he's at home with a cup full of henny, bitch



I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you



Now, let me put this in perspective

Twenty-five to life for the murder, four years for the weapon

I fought the case for two years, but it fades

In the county with the Crips, the Bloods, Essays

Moms talkin' shit, baby mommas trippin'

Keep gettin' diced till the meter do some snitchin'

Niggas ain't silent like they say they was

Sold me out for jealousy, and sold me out for drugs

Hit the four-yard, got a post watchin' killers

Baby Long Mac, H.B

Let them niggas know I want some Lench Mob shit

But if it get crackin', I'm riotin' with the Crips

And if it get racial, I'm riotin' with the blacks

And when we politickin' guns, I'ma need facts

The riots, the malays, removals to self-fights

So fucks about going home, nigga, I got life



I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'm a mober, I'ma mob on you

Four niggas throwin' up the West



Out of the dark alleys of Californ-I-A

Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay

You lookin' over here, but y'all don't want none

We make the homicide rate go up every year

If you a bad mutherfucker, you can make it here

And we ain't throwin' no signs (Oh god), just a clip and a nine

One bullet to the head, put some shit on your mind

Get busy, California crispy

I'm rollin' hundreds, who rollin with me?

Yellow is the color of sun ray

Harley-Davidson's, on Sundays

So don't hate, I'm from the golden state

Do a half pipe off the Golden Gate

Will I live or die? Ain't no tellin'

Before I hit the water, you know what I'm yellin'

Westless? Nah, nah, Westmore

We got Cali movin' L.A. to the Bay connect

We a haters threat, but they ain't made it yet

California woman, palm tree pimpin'

I represent the hood where nigga's always trippin'

Shit talking, crip walking in the summertime

Dubs in the air, bangin' in the sunshine



If I had four of my favourite rappers on a track

I would expect them to have some slap that sound like hella far back

I would expect them to have some shit like this to make me reminisce

When I was up in the dope game, having my money, getting rich

When I was up in the traffic checking my trim abs with my bitch

When my and my people was having a digital beam and flippin' bricks

Talking off flips with faulty chips, throwing our weight around

Thumpers fresh out of the box in case we gotta get down

With a fake caption, and a bunch of lies

If you tell the truth, on some real shit

It's your life, but you don't wanna deal with it

So you talk a lot of shit in the comments

Like a you a Judge, you don't work for the government (No you don't)

Don't complain, you need to stop your bitchin'

You too negative, you sound like a politician

You need positive vibes, some West Coast sunshine

We like to watch it go down and have a good time

It's nothing like a California sunset

With a bad little chick that you wanna hit

And even if you ain't from here, you can get a lot of game from here



I'll always do my best (Do my best)

Ain't, no, half, steppin'

When you tryin' to make a good impression

Do your very best is the lesson

Unless you all salad, no dressin'

I don't like shit half-done

From a job to a piece of filet Mignon

You got to give a full effort

And pray to the Sheppard

You don't get shotgun peppered

Keep your work and your place separate

You know you got a record, and your past is kinda chequered

You got to work double as hard to get half as far, as black as we are

I'm black as the tar, but I'm a star

I'm down as fuck, and up to par (Yeah)

I might cuss, yell or vent

But you know Ice Cube give a thousand percent

This is the final boarding call for flight 1259
departing from Los Angeles, final destination to St. Louis
Thank you
[Ice Cube]

Damn G, the spot's gettin hot

So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?

Police looking at niggaz through a microscope

In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope

They trying to stop it

So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?

Catch a flight to St. Louis

That's cool, cause nobody knew us

We stepped off the plane

Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers

Rented a car at wholesale

Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel

Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty

Cause where we stayin, niggaz look shady

But they can't fade South Central

Cause bustin a cap is fundamental

Checkin out every block close

Seein which one will clock the most

Yeah this is the one no doubt

Bust a U Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out



Ay ay man, whassup nigga?

Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga!

[gun shots]



Now clearin em out meant casualties

Still had the L.A. mentality

Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry

Wouldn't you know, a driveby in Missouri

Them fools got popped

Took their corner next day, set up shop

And it's better than slangin in the Valley

Triple the profit makin more than I did in Cali

Breakin off rocks like Barney Rubble

Cause them mark-ass niggaz don't want trouble

And we ain't on edge when we do work

Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts

Getting bitches and they can't stand a

Nineteen-ninety-one Tony Montana

Now the shit's like a war

of gang violence, where it was never seen before

Punks whirl when the gat bust

Four jheri curl niggaz kickin up dust

And some of them are even lookin up to us

Wearing our colors and talkin that gang fuss

Giving up much love

Dyin for a street, that they ain't even heard of

But other motherfuckers want to stand strong

So you know the phrase, once again it's on



[TV announcer]

Top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central

Los Angeles which are known for their driveby shootings

have migrated into East St. Louis

leaving three dead and two others injured

No arrests have been made

Police say this is a nationwide trend

with similar incidents occuring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma

(female voice repeating in background:

""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere"")



[Ice Cube]

BOOM, my homie got shot he's a goner black

St. Louis niggaz want they corner back

Shooting in snowy weather

It's illegal business, niggaz still can't stick together

Fuckin police got the four-one-one

that L.A. ain't all, surf and sun

But we ain't thinkin, bout the boys

Feudin, like the Hatfields and McCoys

Now the shit's gettin tricky

Cause now they lookin for the colors and the khakis

Damn, the spot's gettin hot from the battle

About to pack up and start slangin in Seattle

But the NARCs, raid about six in the morning

Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin

Put his glock to my chest as I paused

Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers

Tryin to give me, fifty-seven years

Face'll be full of those tattooed tears

It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck

And the public defender ain't givin a fuck

The fool must be sparkin

Talkin about a double life plea bargain

You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G

Plus the Black Guerilla family

And the white pride don't like Northside

And it's a riot if any more niggaz die

No parole or probation

Now this is a young man's summer vacation

No chance for rehabilitation

Cause look at the motherfuckin years that I'm facin

I'ma end it like this cause you know what's up

My life is fucked"

God damn, the bigger the cap the bigger the peelin

And when dealin with the Lench Mob you gots to know

Steady Mobbin is not just the name of this jam, but a way of life

Bound together by motherfuckers that's known

to break em off somethin, give it to me



Four or five niggaz in a mothership

Better known as a goose and we all wanna smother shit

Bent, front and back glass got tint

Tryin to get our hands on some dollars and cents

And fools can't hold us

Every chance we get, we hittin up the rollers

Comin up short of the green guys

And I might start slangin bean pies

Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month

With ""U Can't Touch This"" on the front

I'm bout to get rich

Cause life ain't nuttin but money and fuck a bitch

They drop like dominoes

And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes

So after the screwin

I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings

I'm out the do'

All you might get is a rubber on the floor

Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti

Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin



Bustin caps in the mix

Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six

Cause I'm gettin major

Fuck Pac Tel, move to Sky Pager

Told all my friends

Don't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's is givin ends

Fools get drunk and wanna compete

Slapboxin in the street

Niggaz get mad, tempers are flarin

cause they got a few bitches starin

Just for the nappy heads

But scandalous bitches, make for happy Feds

I'm making my duty to cuss em

out, cause I just don't trust em

And if you tell on me I'm bombin on Betty

Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin



Since one-time so hot

Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the glock

And I'm rollin on rims

Eating soul food, and neckbones from M&M's

Grumblin like a motherfucker

Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit

Saw Sir Jinx bailin'

When I hit a left, I moved felon, 'Whattup loc?'

Don't you know that niggaz get smoked

That take they life for a joke, get in nigga

I take you to the pad zoom

Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom

Jumped back in my low rider

Comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter

Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat

Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at

Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps

But hoes lickin us like stamps

One fool brought the music for the yams

But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch

Cause I had the jam on

And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon

Give me the nappy and make me happy

The hoe said 'Pappy could you slap me

on the ass hard and fast

and could please try not to leave a gash?'

I said yeah, but I don't play sex

When I'm putting on the latex

Slipped on the condom

Fucked around and dropped the bomb son

And it came out sort of like confetti

In for the night, no longer steady mobbin"

in a Catholic school, private school

Man what you want with her?

I'm sick of this bullshit!

Yo man, let me tell you somethin..



[Verse One]

Your daughter was a nice girl, now she is a slut

A queen treatin niggaz just like King Tut

Gobblin up nuts, sorta like a hummingbird

Suckin up the Lench Mob crew, and I'm comin third

Used to get straight A's, now she just skippin class

Oh my, do I like to grip the hips and ass

Only seventeen, with a lot of practice

on black boys jimmies and white boys cactus

Sorry sorry sir, but I gotta be brief

A lotta niggaz like bustin nuts in her teeth

Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic

that don't mean shit, cause she's givin up the ass quick

Quicker than you can say, ""Candy,""

the bitch is on my Snicker... and oh man she

can take on three men - built like He-Men

Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen

Fourteen niggaz in line ready to bang yo'

pride-and-joy, I mean daddy's little angel

Tell the little bitch to bring her ass out the house

cause your daughter's known, for givin up the nappy dug out



[Chorus: repeat 2X]

I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!""

[Pops]

Look motherfucker you better get from in front of my house

with that old god damn bullshit

You girlie-ass motherfucker

You better get out of here witcho' fine ass

Man, youse a little fine motherfucker



[Verse Two]

Mister, mister, before you make me go

I'm here to let you know your little girl is a hoe

Nympho, nympho, boy is she bad

Get her all alone and out comes the kneepads

I know she is a minor and it is illegal

but the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio

And if you de-cide to call rape

we got the little hooker on tape, now:

tell the fuckin slut to please hurry up

and wear that dress that's tight on her butt

So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed

Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead

Face turnin red from grabbin them ankles

Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes

You should hear how she sounds with a cock

And her boots get knocked, from here to Czechoslovakia

Two are on top, one on the bottom

First nigga got the boots; man, you shoulda shot him

cause after I got 'em it was over

Now niggaz get lucky like a four-leaf clover

on daddy's little girl.

She keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel

So tell Cheryl to bring her ass home

cause the line at my house is gettin loooooooong, ay!

Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad

gots to get a job cuz I was a high school dad

Wish I got paid like I was rappin' to the nation

but thats not likely, so here's my application

Pass it to the man at AT&T

Cuz when I was in school I got the a. e. e.

But there's no s. e. for this youngsta

I didn't have no money so now I have to hunch the

Back like a slave, thats what be happenin

but whitey says there's no room for the African

Always knew that I would boycott, jeez

but welcome to McDonalds can I take your order please

Gotta sell ya food that might give you cancer

cuz my baby doesn't take no for an answer

Now I pay taxes that you never give me back

what about diapers, bottles, and similac

Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack

for decent shelter and clothes on my back?

Or should I just wait for help from Bush

or Jesse Jackson, and operation Push

If you ask me the whole thing needs a douch

a masengel what the hell cracker sale in the neighborhood

To the whorehouse bitches,

Miss porker, little joe or Todd Bridges

Or anybody that he know

so I got me a bird, better known as a kilo

Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough

So now you put the feds against me

cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency

I'm never givin' love again

Cuz blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican

Now I remember I used to be cool

till I stopped fillin' out my W-2

Now senators are gettin' hired

and your plan against the ghetto backfired

So now you got a pep talk

but sorry, this is our only room to walk

Cause we don't want a drug push

But a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush

[Verse One]

Here's another topic I'm addressin

so learn a quick lesson, about your Smith and Wesson

Sit your ass back and comprehend

as I let you know about man's best friend

Now remember: it used to be a dog like Lassie

but now in ninety-one it's a gun if you asked me

Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection

I use my nine when suckers start to flexin

Cause if you run up and try to play mine

I'd rather have a AK than a fuckin canine

Cause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetch her

me and the dog's goin out on a stretcher

And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that

big black gat, aim and I hit that

Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den

Nowadays.. a gat is man's best friend



[Chorus + Cube saying ""Man's best friend"" after *3 first time]



[Verse Two]

Here is the reason why Ice Cube pack

Just in case the little punks try to jack

I can't put a motherfuckin pitbull

under a coat, in the small of my back

So I gotta take my beretta, and I betcha

it'll probably work, a 100 percent better

Cause it'll keep me out of danger

with sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber

So this goes to all y'all intruders

Beware of the owner, cause the owner is a shooter

I don't just wanna give your ass rabies

I'd rather have your ass pushing up daisies

And I can't do that with Benji,

Rin Tin Tin, or Spuds McKenzie

Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den

Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend

Its me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop
The spot's hot and everybody nervous
That's when the blue car served us
Oh why did fools had to let loose
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce

Big Tom had to push us

13 niggaz runnin straight to the bushes

For they gats so they could draw down

But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down

Not known why I dropped out

Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out

So now I gotta jet

Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin wet

Tryin to see if we got him

Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom

Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out

Yelled to the homies then I blacked out



Woke up in the back of a tray

On my way, to MLK

That the county hospital jack

Where niggaz die over a little scratch

Still sittin in the trauma center

In my back is where the bullet entered

Yo nurse I'm gettin kind of warm

Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin form

Coughin up blood on my hands and knees

Then I heard ""freeze nigger don't move""

Yo, I didn't do a thing

Didn't wanna go out like my man Rodney King

Still got gaffled

Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel

Now I'm handcuffed

Being asked information on my gang affiliation

I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes

And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime



I need to see a MD

And ya'll mothafuckers giving me the third degree

Look at the waiting room

Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room

Nobody gettin help

Since we poor

The hospital move slow

Now I'm layed out

People steppin over me to get closer to the tv

Just like a piece of dog shit

Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet

One hour done passed

Done watched two episodes of M*A*S*H

And when I'm almost through

They call my name and put me on ICU

Halfway dead

No respect and handcuffed to the bed

Now the trauma starts

Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart

So I begin the ass kissin

Just to get looked at by an overworked physician

Got the chills, but my temperatures 103

Only got a band-aid and an IV

That's when I start cussin

Police steady askin me who did the bustin



Why oh why can't I get help

Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self

Too many black bodies the hospital housin

So at 10 P.M. I was Audi 5000"

[Cube] Huh-huh, huh-HAH..

""I'm comin!"" [repeat 3X]

[Cube] I'm comin!



[Verse One]

I wanna kill him, cause he tried to play me like the trick

but you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with

I got the A to the motherfuckin K, and it's ready to rip

Slapped in my banana clip

And I'm lookin.. (lookin..)

Is he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?

It seems like he got the whole country behind him

so it's sort of hard to find him

But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth

Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out

Cause the shit he did was uncalled for

tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore

And that shit ain't fly

So now I'm settin up, the ultimate drive-by

And when you hear this shit,

it make the world say ""DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam.""



""Do the niggaz run this moth-er-fuck-er?"" [repeat 2X]



[door knocking]

""Momma!! Some man at the front do'!""

""Sit yo' ass down.""

""Uhh hi.. I have reason to believe that someone in this household

has just turned eighteen, am I correct?""



[Verse Two]

Here's why I wanna kill the punk

cause he tried to take a motherfuckin chunk of the funk

He came to my house, I let 'em bail in

cause he said he was down with the L.M.

He gave up a little dap

then turned around, and pulled out a gat

I knew it was a caper

I said, ""Please don't kill my mother,"" so he raped her

Tied me up, took me outside

and I was thrown in a big truck

And it was packed like sardines

Full of niggaz, who fell for the same scheme

Took us to a place and made us work

all day and we couldn't have shit to say

Broke up the families forever

and to this day black folks can't stick together

And it's odd..

Broke us down, made us pray - to his God

And when I think about it,

it make me say ""DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam.""



""I'm comin!"" [repeat 3X]



[Verse Three]

Now in ninety-one, he wanna tax me

I remember, the son of a bitch used to axe me

and hang me by a rope til my neck snapped

Now the sneaky motherfucker wanna ban rap

and put me under dirt or concrete

But God, can see through a white sheet

Cause you the devil in drag

You can burn your cross well I'll burn your flag

Try to give me the H-I-V

so I can stop makin babies like me

And you're givin dope to my people chump

Just wait til we get over that hump

Cause yo' ass is grass cause I'ma blast

Can't bury rap, like you buried jazz

Cause we stopped bein whores, stop doin floors

So bitch you can fight your own wars

So if you see a man in red white and blue

gettin janked by the Lench Mob crew

It's a man who deserves to buckle

I wanna kill Sam cause he ain't my motherfuckin Uncle!

Horny little devil, you can't bust a nut

Lookin at my girlfriend's black skin

You wanna jump in, but she don't like white men

So don't throw that work you fuckin jerk

Or get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker

She ain't with the pale face

Cause y'all fuck at a snail's pace

And you might get sprayed with mace

By the ebony

So when she's doing her job you better let her be

Don't try to pinch the gluterus

Thinkin that you about to knock out the uterus

Cause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick

And where I'm from, devils get their ass kicked

Mr. Sexual Harrasment

Asking for a blow while the answer is ""fuck no""

Looks like you wanna terminate

But that's when I go Psycho like Norman Bates

I wanna kill the devil for talkin shit

Cause he can't get a taste of the chocolate

African breast; cause white bitches got no butt and no chest

Black women have bodies like goddesses

Sorta like Venus, but put away your penis

Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker

That's why I'm lighter than the average brother

Cause you raped our women and we felt it

But it'll never happen again if I can help it (me neither)

Cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet

So horny little devil, you better listen

Before your ass comes up missin

and it's like that



Now you wanna get me

Horny little must be a F-A-G

Tryin to fuck me out my land and my manhood

Got broke eating Spam and canned goods

Locking down on my neighborhoods

Treat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand

But my ass is a virgin

You mignt have fucked the Indians

but you can't surgeon me

And when I'm on top I wont be fuckin ya

I'd rather put a buck in ya

Cause I hate the devil with a passion

and when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin

Dig a hole and throw his ass in

And I won't be happy til I'm down to my last ten

Get his fuckin pitchfork

Tie him up, and then feed the bitch pork

Little devil wanna fuck me out my pay

But horny little devil true niggaz aren't gay

And you can't play with my Yo-Yo

and definitely can't play with me you fuckin homo

Cause we'll blow your head off

And turn that white sheet into a red cloth

Plus when they're all dead

I can quit that jheri juice and get a bald head

Then let it nap up

Go down to the corner store and beat the Jap up

Clean all the crap up

out my city

Now the whole block look shitty

Put his dick on a wood block

Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop

Now who's the next to nut

Color Me Badd, but you can't sex me up

So don't even try to put a dick in a die

Because this is what why in 1991 I'ma get my gun

Put an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel

I'm lookin in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test
With four brothas in the SS
I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin in the cut

Is this a jack or a kidnap?

Since I'm never ever slippin I fully strapped

I grab my gat out the glove

Now, do these fools got a problem with me?

Or do they got love?

So when the light turns green, I don't bone out

I wanna see what these black men are all about

Cuz if it's my time, I'm just short

If not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport

First they get behind my ride...

Then they switch lanes to the left side

I'm scopin out the one smokin indo

Comin up fast, rollin down his window

He threw up a sign, I put away my nine

Fool, cuz I'm color blind



Killa Cali, the state where they kill

Over colors cuz brothas don't know the deal

And they'll cap you, not if they have to

But if they want to, first they might confront you

But every nigga on my block can't stop

And he won't stop and he don't stop

Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang

And rookies ain't the only ones that drop

Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed

And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most

Say the wrong word

then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird

Bust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga

For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get

But men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split

It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me

Cuz I slang these thangs like a G

It's on, is anybody killin for the summertime

I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind



I'm fresh outta county on bail

And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail

For some gang related activity

Cuz everyday, different fools try to get with me

For no more than a color, or territory

Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story

So what's left, the judge goes deaf

When you try to tell your side

And you ain't blue eyed

Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin'

And just hand your car keys over to your woman

Because it aint no sunshine where you headed

And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it

But now, I got time to think

Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink

And I ain't even shed a tear

Cuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here

Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph

Cuz brothas, you don't know the half

On the streets I was damn near outta my mind

But ever since I've been down

I'm colorblind



Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine

I was told to peel a cap on the other side

Yo, young and dumb, full of come up, a baby loc

I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke



Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin

Cuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin

Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride

Started up the bucket and headed for the other side



Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip

Hit the 5 dollar stick and then I put in my clip



So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost

I had my mind set on sendin niggaz to Harrison Ross



Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes

Thinkin should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive

Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side



I ain't contributin to genocide (why?)

Cuz I'm colorblind



Niggaz in the hood ain't changed

And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang

Cuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn

Every which way I get burned baby

Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red

Put 'em together and we color 'em dead

Dead, dyin, gettin smoked like part of the fun

They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral



I understand how all my homeboys feel

Cuz I was shot and to this day, I pack my steel

Cuz I was born in a certain territory

Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories

With blue and red bandanas on the street

And if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep

Cuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind

And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind."

When I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders
Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders
Fucking with the girls in the fourth grade
Either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids

Walking with the schoolhouse bully

By doing that, I had a lot of pull, G

Cheating on tests, making a mess

Cussing like a sailor at recess

It must a been a half moon

Cause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom

Chewing on Good and Plenties

Got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies

Yo I was living like the class clown

Pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes man

When you young it's hard to see

That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD

Popping out your window with a BB gun

Better yet knocking on your door and run

Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank

Even though I was still shooting blanks

As soon as the dark hit

I was stealing candy out the corner market

Until I got my ass whipped

Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit



Thirteen, that's how old I was

When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz

And I was looking at any butt and ass

Me and my homies started cutting class

Going up to the high school

Looking for any bitch I could lie to

Tell em I was older than I really was

Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed

That's what a mack's made of

But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love

Hard as a rock the long way

And then I put the rubber on the wrong way

But I still gotta have it

Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit

Goddamn I was hype

A virgin but I still knew how to lay the pipe

Even though the ho worked me

I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque

Then the shit got strange, money

I started shaking and jimmy felt funny

Then the nut came gushing

I jumped up got dressed and start pushing

Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick

Cause I was still young doing dumb shit



At 17 got my first Volkswagen

And mastered the life-long art of dragging

To the women in college

Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge

Breaking in cars and all that

Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat

Fucking at a real fast rate

Til they said that I might not graduate

Then I said, ""Fuck the dumb shit

Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick

If things continue.""

So I start rapping about shit I been through

And I got real good

Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood

Trying to be baby macks

Doing shit that I did seven years back

Going through a stage

But before they can grow up they on the front page

And they moms is having a fit

Cause they died young, doing dumb shit"

But don't point the finger you jiggaboo

Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you

Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice

No Ice Cube, just Vanilla Ice

And yall sit and scream and cuss

But there's no one ta blame- but US



US ... will always sing the blues

Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes

And if ya step on mine ya pushed a button

""Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'""

Just like a beast

But I'm the first nigga ta holler out {PEACE, BLACK MAN}

I beat my wife and children to a pulp

When I get drunk and smoke dope

Got a bad heart condition

Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's

Bet my money on the dice and the horses

Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces

Go to church but they tease us

Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus

They used to call me Negro

After all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe

No respect and ignored

And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford

In jail cause I can't pay the mother

Held back in life because of my color

Now this is just a little summary

Of US, but yall think it's dumb of me

To hold a mirror to ya face, but trust

Nobody gives a fuck about..."

Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft.
First you was down with the AK,
and now I see you on a video with Michel'le?
Lookin' like straight bozos.
I saw it comin', that's why I went solo.

And kept on stompin',

when ya'll mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton.

Livin' with the whites, one big house,

and not another nigga in site.

I started off with too much cargo,

dropped four niggas now I'm makin' all the dough.

White man just rulin'.

The Niggas With Attitudes -- who ya foolin'?

Ya'll niggas just phony,

I put that on my mama and my dead homeys.

Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin';

Ay yo Dre, stick to producin'.

Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-a-dick;

Eazy E saw your ass and went in it quick.

You got jealous when I got my own company,

but I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me.

Tryin' to sound like Amerikkka's Most,

you could yell all day but you don't come close.

Cuz you know I'm the one that flown,

ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go.

With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B, and ya'll disgrace the C-P-T.

Cuz you're gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy,

with no vaseline...



[Refrain]

[L.L. sample:] ""Now you're gettin' done without vaseline..."" [3x]

[Biz Markie sample:] ""Damn, it feels good to see people...on it""



The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin',

who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?

You're gettin' fucked real quick,

and Eazy's dick, is smellin' like MC Ren's shit.

Tried to tell you a year ago,

but Willie D told me to let a hoe be a hoe, so

I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked,

now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank.

Tried to dis Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it

cuz the broomstick fit your ass so perfect.

Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls,

cuz I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers.

Gang-banged by your manager, fella,

gettin' money out your ass, like a mothafuckin' Ready Teller.

Givin' up the dollar bills,

now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels.

So don't believe what Ren say,

cuz he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte,

but I got a whip for ya Toby;

used to be my homey, now you act like you don't know me.

It's a case of divide-and-conquer,

cuz you let a Jew break up my crew.

House nigga gotta run and hide,

yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside.

So don't front, MC Ren, cuz I remember when you drove a B 2-10.

Broke as a mothafuckin' joke.

Let you on the scene to back up the Verse Team.

It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart,

and they rippin' your asshole apart.

By takin' your green, oh yeah,

the Villain does get fucked with no vaseline.



[Refrain scratched]



I never have dinner with the President.

I never have dinner with the President.

I never have dinner with the President.

And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant.

Now I think you a snitch,

throw a house nigga in a ditch.

Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys.

You little maggot; Eazy E turned faggot.

With your manager, fella,

fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella.

But if they were smart as me,

Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree.

With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline.

Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on...

till that Jheri curl is gone.

On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation.

Heard you both got the same bank account,

dumb nigga, what you thinkin' bout?

Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple.

Cuz you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew

with a white Jew tellin' you what to do.

Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs.

With a midget who's a punk too,

tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you.

Eric Wright, punk, always into somethin', gettin' fucked at night.

If you figure how to get a check out of Sony

Oh Lord, thought I watch preaching to the choir

When I'm in this pool, bet I might catch on fire

Ass full of gas, do you got a lighter?

Hand full of ass, why should I retire

The shit I spit might inspire a messiah

To throw these lies in a lake full of fire

Ain't nothing flier than my fuckin' rims and my tires

And a word to the wise, you better fuckin' recognize

That I been on the block since bitches did the wop

Since Floyd and Damian kept rocks in they socks, nigga

Taught 2Pac how to keep it gangster

I showed Biggie Smalls how to release his anger

King T, KRS and the homie Chuck D

With Too Short and the D-R-E

We made it too hard, check our family tree

See you try to make a snapple out of all them bad apples

Nigga 'nough

Leave you baffled then, careful then

Running through your house like it's a motherfuckin' raffle

I'm a asshole with tabasco, you the last hoe I would ask for

If I had to leave your house walked into a ho house

The drink that I pour out, the weed that I blow out

It's all for my nigga Big Hurt, when I show out

Picture this in a frame, get tore out

When I wanna go out, red carpets get rolled out

We all had to struggle if you got a black mother

We all had to scrap with our uncles and our brothers

Bedroom window, no curtains, used covers

Motherfucker always claim to be the hardest

But these motherfuckers never claim to be the smartest

I'm a artist that'll paint your rigor mortis

You silly rabbit nigga, here come the tortoise

Fast is smooth and smooth is slow

And that's how you get it, 20 years in a row

Advance how you get 20 years in a hole

Bet 10 that you ass ain't got no soul

Grab that cold ass white men steel

Cap peels, run like an oil spill

Big drills, found him in the landfill

You got 30 years but you my man still

Fuck them tears, Tony Montana

Caught you in Montana, extradited to Atlanta

This ain't the banana nigga, this is Alabama

Nail in your coffin when the judge rock the hammer, nigga

Like Kim she'll run circles 'round you bitches twice

Now, it might get funky but it won't get ugly

Niggas might not like me but they still love me

Niggas might talk shit, they whisper and huddle

'Cause they know my rebuttal might leave a puddle

Now the streets is talkin' until they see me walkin' up the block, then all the bullshit stop

Anything I do, don't take it personal 'cause when a nigga gone, that shit ain't reversible

Fuck a funeral song and a procession

Keep God on your dome and count your blessings

Keep the hood in your heart but Heaven on your mind

Shake 'em up and roll seven every time

Pick 'em up, yup, stick 'em up

Every time you see me got a different color cup

This ain't about dyin', it's all about livin'

It's all about makin' everyday Thanksgivin'

It's all about givin', about stayin' driven

It ain't about you, it's about these children

So when a nigga die, stop cryin' and ventin'

Will somebody in here bump George Clinton?

Will somebody in here hug my fam?

Don't worry about me, you know where I am

That's kinda trifle, caise that's a knife-o

AK-47, assault rifle

Hold the fifty, I'm nifty, pow

I gotta new style, ""WATCH OUT NOW!""

I hate motherfuckers claimin that they foldin bank

But steady talkin shit in the holding tank

First you wanna step to me

Now your ass screamin for the deputy

They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row

Now they runnin up in ya slow

You're gone, used to be the Don Juan (Check that shit out!)

Now your name is just Twan

Switch it, snap it, rollin your eyes and neck

You better run a check

[Verse Three: Ice Cube]



If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate

You coulda had a V8

Instead of a tre-eight slug to the cranium (POOOOOW!)

I got six and I'm aimin em

Will I shoot or keep you guessin

Cause fuck you and that shit ya stressin

Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good

There goes the neighbourhood hooker (Slut!)

Go ahead and keep your drawers

Givin up the claps and who needs applause

At a time like this, pop the coochie and ya dead

The bitch is a Miami Hurricane hit

Sprung, niggaz call her 'Lips and Lungs'

Nappy dugout, get the fuck out

Cause women like you gets no respect

Bitch, you better run a check

One, two, three and I come with the wicked
style and you know that I'm from the wicked

crew, act like you knew

cos I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo

Pick it, wicked rhymes, picket signs

While me and the mob gotta truck full of 9's]

Play ya and I'll slay ya

I got thug-made dough by the hey-a

Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and it's a must

to DUCK DUCK DUCK before I bust

Lookin for the one that did it

but like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it

Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills

and I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills

Sittin at the pad just chillin

cos Larry Parker just got two million, oh what a feelin

So shake that nigga and pass me the pill

and I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal

Like it, dig it, maybe and watch that ???

Kick it cos I get wicked



[Chorus: (some toaster, once again won't translate to avoid offending)]



[Verse 2:]



Won't say nuttin, just listen

Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison

Come my way and get served

Still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb

Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin

Never seen with a happy grin

Show the fat foul cos I'm down

Take a look around

and all you see is big black boots steppin

Use my steel toe as a weapon

Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to

label this nigga, tape with the sticker

Kickin out girls that's nicety

Yo, I gotta body count like Ice-T

From here to New York

I get skins and ain't talkin bout pork

Swine, pig, dick

Listen to the flow of a so-called negro

who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett

Dig it cos I get wicked



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]



People wanna know how come

I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm

Ready to bring that noise

Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys

April 29th was power to the people

and we might just see a sequel

cos police got equal pay

A horse is a pig that don't fly straight

Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams

down with the pilgrims

Just a super slave

We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave

I'm wicked enough to board this

Cos now it's on to the fullest

Gorilla straight from the mist

But I don't miss when it comes to this

Bring the yellow tape

The white cape, cos I'm so straight

Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it

Bigot, cos I get wicked"

That's what you get, if you ever try to smoke the nigga

Don't provoke a nigga, I'm from that urban community

they gave me a house, for me and my spouse

call my momma and my aunt,

I let them dance with the devil,

dig their own grave and I gave them the shovel

fuck, my daddy built that house

and when he got drunk he almost killed that house

is this the american dream, or the american scheme?

that got me walking in these american streets?

its kinda sad when you have to get a hernia,

cuz you help your grand mama move her furniture



if I can sell you the american dream, I can sell you anything

I can give a fuck about a dow jones average

what the fuck you do when your paycheck is average?

nurse high as a kite,

in charge with my life,

and everything is lost,

And it ain't about chivalry

Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on the corner

See 'em come up and fuck up the owner

See 'em throw up Westside California

Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it

And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

So if I act like a pimp ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

Don't be scared of them people

Walk up in there and show them that you equal (fuck them fuck them)

Don't be material a nigga grew up on milk and cereal

Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail

Love the way these niggaz smell, keep comin' back, can't you tell?

Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle

Love to see my woman juggle nuts 'cause she got to hustle

No kid left behind but he get the run-around

Can't you motherfuckers see that they tryin' to dumb us down?

Don't trust the government, President is for sale

He don't give a fuck about a nigga, just a oil well

Sell crack, go to jail, bust a rap, go to hell

Do I got to sell my soul if I wanna go to Yale?

Go kiss Oprah's ass if you wanna be Gail

I'd rather have my ass kissed up in Bloomingdale

You can go be a pimp, you can go be a hoe

But you only gon' get paid off what you know

You wanna take the life God handed to me

Send it back to him cause you ain't a fan of me

Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me

That's a animal, a fuckin cannibal

I'm Geronimo and Hannibal, with international

You a persona, now I'm a goner

I'm an O.G., never had to fake it

God gave me this, how you gon' take it?

What'chu gon' tell 'em, when you get to heaven

and he asks you why did you send back his present?

Who the fuck are you~? You motherfuckin peasant!

Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing

Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes

Before you shoot me man think about it

Let's go have a drink about it

Before you make a stink about it

Man let's talk about it maybe we can walk up out it

But just don't be a coward

And take my life, cause you got the power

of the white man's gunpowder

Cause you might face a gun tower

And time never run out

They take the fun out, 'til your life run out

So don't pull the gun out

If you ever want a house just like Run's house

It's better than the big house

Let's go find some women we can dig out

Find a place we can pig out

Party all night 'til the owner say get out

It's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket

[Verse 2]

Now pull in the parking lot

Nigga, find a parking spot

Fired up, everyone want to spark a lot

Puff-puff-pass, we out on Ave.

Lookin' for a big fat ass to harass!

Is it you? Uh-huh, I see you lookin'

When we roll by, pussy still cookin'

Freaks get tooken when they lookin' for stars 

If you don't like my face - bitch, look at my car!

Keep it simple, I told you once befo'

It really don't matter how I get you to the mo'

It really don't matter how I get you in my low

Just hop in, let's go

And let your friends know!

[Verse 3]

Do ya thang, girl!

Fuck what they lookin' at!

We the dogs gettin' chased by the pussycat

West Coast, baby - with so much gravy

You should call The Navy, ever since the 80's

I've been doin' good, they been doin' bad

When I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that

But never chase it, my game is so basic

As soon as I lace it - baby, wanna taste it?

Just face it, put me to the test

Ice Cube would ace it, I'm built for success

Fuck a Rockstar! We wanna party like a Rap Star

In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)

You make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's

And we get lap-dance from nuns 

They put away they crucifix

And they say, ""Ice Cube - boy, you the shit!""



[Chorus]

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

It's too hot today

Fuck what you got to say

Fuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery

Ain't gonn take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery

Ah, he's a show off, a hot head go off

Yeah don't make he mad

He might tear the fucking door off

Take all his cars, and don't try to fall

Cuz one of his people, might cut your fucking toe off

Ice Cube baby, make you take him serious

Everthin' I do, ends with you curious

Lookin' for the best rapper

I am the one, that had to take the ghetto route
I am the one, don't make me pull this metal out
I'm coming straight from the cage WHO LET HIM OUT?
Crazy nigger thought he was gone, but he ain't gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home

When I hit the block, watch 'em scatter like roaches

So don't be fake, 'cause I know what a ho is

Handle my business, no playin' 'cause I'm focused

You the definition of what a fuckin' joke is

When they see you comin', they play with your emotions

Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans

Yeah I said oceans, yeah I mean plural

My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl

We'll fuck up your world, no rules to my drama

We'll include yo mama, if you fuck with my commas

I ain't tryin' to scare you

I ain't tryin' to hear you

I ain't tryin' to control that nigger in the mirror

I'll I'm tryin' to do is bark before I fight

Before I lay you down, might as well be polite (let's fight!)

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come (I'm comin!)

Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero

A nigger for the people, where ever they go we go



[Ice Cube, Verse 2]



Now when I roll through the hood, lil' kids watch my every move

Tryin' to be a good example, don't make me bury you

If you sick on my swagger, bitch take some Theraflu

Don't underestimate the damage caused by a '22

Pop yo' ass right behind the ear what did they hear?

Nothin' but a firecracker, hit you like a linebacker

Don't forget the grand fact that I am a grinder

And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya

Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China?

Nothin' motherfucker just don't act like a vagina

You won't catch the wrath of this hardcore rhymer

Now you got fifty-five niggers right behind ya

Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate

Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate

Straight from the west and we got to be respected

Yeah, it's going down, here 'em runnin' for the exits? (Motherfucker!)

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come (I'm comin'!)

It's Doughboy in this bitch going ape shit

Lynch mob niggers takin' off like a spaceship

Pesos to Euros, eatin' those green and great chips

Get 'em by the bag, you can say we Frito Lay chips

I'm so hungry that I can eat these niggers' faces

Meet the plastic surgeons givin' Hollywood a face lift

Off the grape shit, and I'm feelin' like I'm faceless

The Mob you ain't winning, motherfucker, don't say shit

You ain't nothin' to play with, nigger that be the basics

I can spray shit quick to leave a nigger faceless

Playin' Superman will get a brave nigger sprayed quick

Niggers can't fade this, music for the ages

Because we get it in like Young Pesci with the pen

Big fish in the water, bitch, you in the deep end

Boy I pull you deep in, underneath the deep end

Nigger have you sinkin', 

When I catch 'em creepin',

If you try to get with me, pull a four and a fifty
Fuck your monkey ass up, like Bobby did Whitney
Trigger fingers get itchy, when niggaz get bitchy

And they need they story told on Jerry or Ricki

Pull your green in your iffy, I'm clean and I'm spiffy

If they lock me up today I'll be back in a jiffy

All my niggaz that's with me, all my bitches are picky

To ride around us right on time, bitch you know it's tricky

Take a hit of the sticky, everybody get tipsy

When we hittin' that whiskey, all my niggaz get pissy

Don't fuck with no sissy, all we bumpin' is missy

If you know where I am, motherfucker come get me

I'm a man not a Mickey, all my niggaz love hickies

that don't go away 'til you're well in your sixties

All I'm wearin' is Dickies, don't try to evict me

When we come to Atlanta we gon' re-open Nikki's

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

Barracuda with it, call security

Fuck the dress code, I'm in a white T with jewelry

Hand to my side with my nine, sat lyin' back

In the club with your baby mama in my lap

Lookin' fly like I got a pocket full of stones

Pro fitted on, wearin' chronic cologne

Big watch, big rocks, grip glocks, dick guap

What you niggaz thought, motherfucker this is Lench Mob

Dub make the trigger knock, talk shit

I'll put additional air condition holes in your Bentley top

And shorty got 'em gettin' low, I rich rolls

Swervin' on them MVP's, I call 'em Kobe's cause they 24's

Still spittin' out sunflowers, Dub and Don Dadda

Bustin' more gun powder than gun towers

Down South, y'all can Screw it, it's the West, too truest

Keep the party jumpin' like do it fluid and never lose it

Who my gangsta rap teacher? (Ice Cube) Nigga you better know it

It's the Don Dadda Jr. slash motherfuckin' poet

Sit back and take notes while I spin like hundred spokes

My flow is razor sharp, I'm comin' straight for your throat

With that West Coast, gangbang, watch him when his chain hang

East Coast, Down South, niggaz do the same thang

Throw up your dubs like Wu-Tang, who bang

harder than that nigga bailin' through your hood with two chains

Swangin' like his nuts, 'cause he don't give a fuck

Bout no nigga that ain't bangin' in no khakis or some Chuck's

It's that Westside, Connect'd with that nigga who flow so wreckless

He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I'll bet this

motherfuckin' Coast ain't got shit after me

Ain't have shit before Cube except a W.C.

The Maad Circle is back, with mad purple in fact

I'm bout to join the Lench Mob, that's me squirtin' the mac, motherfuckers

All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard
The West coast warlord, and the future is today
Cause tomorrow - that shit never come
I worry 'bout today and this urban decay

I worry 'bout hip-hop, when did it flip-flop

Get whack, and turn into gridlock

I don't know is it a government plot?

I don't give a fuck whether you love it or not

That's all we got and if you throw it away

You dumb as OJ, off a for-tay

In your Izod, this the rap God

What'chu gon' put up, in your iPod?

Downloader, what'chu gon' do

when your favorite MC, got to sue you

Cause he got to eat ain't nuttin taboo

Get your ass beat by Erykah Badu

Cause you wanna steal this good music

Put me out of business, now you lose it



[Chorus: sung with ad libs]

Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout tomorrow (that shit never come)

This is very hard to swallow

Keep your hand up on that throttle

Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow



[Ice Cube]

Tomorrow, I'ma handle my business

But today, I'ma drink this liquor

Cause tomorrow, I might be a little quicker

But today, I'm just the same old nigga

You know that shit is still a day away

Do yo' thang baby put your life on layaway

Cause everybody is Nostradamus

Boy don't you know that tomorrow ain't promised?

To all the lil' mamas

Don't do a nigga, like Isiah Thomas

If you a bitch, please be honest

Actin like a hoe you're not an an-gel

While you're, daydreamin 'bout your future

Motherfucker come around the corner and shoot you

Don'tcha, get stuck in neutral

Put your shit in drive, while you still alive cause



[Chorus]



[Ice Cube]

Tomorrow~! That shit never come

I know it sounds strange but today is never done

I'm up in the Range when the clock strikes 1

While y'all countin sheep, I'm countin Benja-mons

Up on my feet at the break of the sun

President of the Gangster Na-tion

We don't go to war, we go to the store

We rob from the rich, and give to the poor

Hip-Hop, oh what a bore

Lettin college motherfuckers run the front door

(Fuck that!) Let's take it back to the streets

Don't let Viacom, dictate the heat

The nerve of them, I never heard of dem

Askin me about, my urban spins

And if I got about, a thousand of them

I'm a crate MC, accordin to them

Fuck that!

Stand tall, live your life to the limit
Cause haterism seem like a fucking epidemic

And look at Ice Cube, I ain't no gimmick

I'm straight from the hood, I got to represent it

Now - every day I think about my color

And all the crazy shit we do to one another

I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your cuz brother

Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother

If not, we gon' pull these triggers

Show the world we deserve to be called niggaz

I make a fuck-up, like Don Imus

bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness

You can too, you got the power to

Don't let this motherfuckin system devour you

I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowin you

But check it out I understand what you goin through

But remember, brothers and sisters

You can still, stand, tall

Just be thankful...

For what you got

I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh

Here comes another rapper with a song about hope

All you wanna hear is a song about dope

And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope

But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap

No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note

Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes

And some of our people used to hang from trees

Now the only thing hangin muh'fucker is DEEZ

So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right

Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke

I'm the sunlight, too bright to look

When it's all said and done I should write the book

You too cool for school, too old to know?

Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow

I understand, it ain't no love lost

But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus

[Ice Cube]

Yeah, f'real

I was born in the mud but I came out clean

That's 'til the government tried to intervene

Tried to lock me up when I was only 19

Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream

I make shit raw that piss off the law

If you want some fake shit turn this off

If you want some realness I know you can feel this

Maybe we can heal this just like an illness

Black on black, I got'cho back

People don't think that we know how to act

Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack

And the CIA, won't take it back

Never on top, always on the bottom

Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham

Cause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten

Keep on pushin, get 'em 'til we got 'em

I know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue

Speak on it and they'll get mad at you

You think I do this bullshit for your gratitude?

I'm a Nigga With a Attitude

I'ma do what I gotta do just to change my latitude

So bang this with the four-five stainless

And understand that you looking at the famous

West-coast rapper who act like an anus

Hollywood, they thought they could tame this

Pit-bull, but I know what the game is

Them fuckers cheat like an NBA ref

If you smoke one?

They'll electrocute you to death

I got god on my intellect

Godzilla by the neck

When the nigga come through, who you wanna holla at

Ghostwriters hit the deck

When ya boi got a tech

Where the fuck is Africa-Bamabata at

We need to take it back, fuck Viacom

Clear Clear Channel and Radio One

You muthafuckas programmed by the programmers

That's why you getting locked up by the dope slammers

Not me



[Hook:]

It takes a nation of niggas to hold us back [x4]



[Verse 2:]

They music so fluffy, I'm a stay gutter

That shit is kinda popcorn, my shit is so butter

My style never change in 22 summers

Straight independent and doing my numbers

This shit don't sell, you know I'm still paid

So sour-puss niggas, can drink lemonade

I'm doin it for the love

You doing it because

You need that advancement to spend on them dubs

I don't need a penny, but I need many

Don't worry bout ma money boi, cause I got plenty

You muthafuckas worry bout flossing so much

You don't know the fundamentals, you forgot how to brush

These thirty-two teeth

Will give your ass grief

Bite you like a fat burger if you got beef

So whose it gonna be, your favourite MC

Your scared of the government, they scared of me

Now what?



[Hook:]

It takes a nation of niggas to hold us back [x3]

It takes a nation of niggas and streets of crack"

[Ice Cube]

You looking at the grand wizard, war lord vocal chord so vicious

And I don't have to show riches to pull up pull off with some bad bitches

And it ain't about chivalry

It's about dope lyrics and delivery

It's about my persona ain't nothing like a man that can do what he wanna

Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on the corner

See 'em come up and fuck up the owner

See 'em throw up Westside California

Nigga I'm hot as Phoenix Arizona

I'm utah I got multiple bitches

It's a new law keep a hold of yo riches

Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it

And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant



[Chorus 1]

I can say what I want to say ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

If I call you a nigga ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

I can act like an animal ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

If I eat you like a cannibal ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it



[Ice Cube]

I'm raw as a dirty needle

Choke an eagle

Just to feed all my people

Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you

And I spit lava

I got the fearless flow

Don't get near this ho

If you sacred to go

I keep it gangsta and why should change that

fuck you all you motherfuckers tryin to change rap

But arent you the same cat that sat back when they brought cocaine back

I'm tryin to get me a Maybach

I heard nigga back in 1971



[Chorus 2]

So if I act like a pimp ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

If I call you a nappy headed ho ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

If I shoot up your college ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

If I rob you of knowledge ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it



[Ice Cube]

Thank God when I bless the mic

You finally get to hear the shit that you like

A nigga talkin bout real life so you can try to get this shit right

Use your brain not your back use your brain not a gat

It's a party not a jack (for real)

Don't be scared of them people

Walk up in there and show them that you equal (fuck them fuck them)

Don't be material a nigga grew up on milk and cereal

I never for got vaness and imperial

Look at my life Ice Cube is a miracle

It could be you if you was this lyrical

It could be her if she was this spiritual

Cuz me and Allah go back like cronies

I don't got to be fake cause he is my homie



[Chorus 3]

If I sell a liitle crack ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it

If I die and I rap ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it

If I take you for granted ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it

If I fuck up the planet ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Ice Cube]

Oh yeah and another thing

For all ya niggaz that don't do gangsta rap

I'ma be a killa, yep a urban guerrilla
I'ma stack scrilla, yeah buy me a villa
Sell a 5-0 to my auntie Priscilla
I don't give a fuck that she look like ""Thriller""

Hit that shit one more time and fuck around and kill her

Cause I got the heart of a Pittsburgh Steeler

Black nigga draped in gold, with a nine milla

Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail

Love the way these niggaz smell, keep comin' back, can't you tell?

Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle

Love to see my woman juggle nuts 'cause she got to hustle

I don't give a fuck how my life go

Now I'm a slave man to this caveman without Geico

Everybody wanna call Michael a psycho

But he ain't never came through the hood with a rifle

Gunnin' niggaz down 'cause they don't got the right clothes

Hit the wrong person 'cause we shoot just like hoes

First I was blood thirsty, Mr.-Mr. Controversy

Now I wanna beg for mercy, should have took my ass to Berkeley

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

Fuck school nigga, if I grow a little taller

Everybody tell me I'm gon' do it, I'm gon' be a baller

So fuck that thinkin', fuck that thank and fuck them Lincoln's, I want Franklin's

Come back through here with my crew, I'm gon' have my own shoe

I'm gon' be that little fool comin' in your living room

Starting point guard nigga, fresh out of middle school

Either it's the NBA or it's the NFL

I don't know what else I can do to keep my ass up out of jail

I wanna be like Tiger Woods, swing that club, make you sick

(I wanna be like Pacman Jones), (I wanna be like Michael Vick)

I wanna be like Barry Bonds, (I wanna be like O.J. Simpson)

Leave this field, leave this prison, tell you motherfuckers where to kiss 'em

I wanna be all broke up, movin' all old and slow

I wanna be a alcoholic just like Broadway Joe

I wanna be a sideshow, kinda like Iron Mike

Used to have a few Bentleys, now I just ride a bike



[Chorus - X2]

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?



[Ice Cube]

Fuck school nigga, they ain't tryin' to educate me

All they give a fuck is what I memorized lately

I'm gon' have to teach myself, clock that money, get that wealth

I wanna be like Santa Claus, I don't wanna be no fuckin' elf

No kid left behind but he get the run-around

Can't you motherfuckers see that they tryin' to dumb us down?

Don't trust the government, President is for sale

He don't give a fuck about a nigga, just a oil well

Sell crack, go to jail, bust a rap, go to hell

Do I got to sell my soul if I wanna go to Yale?

Go kiss Oprah's ass if you wanna be Gail

I'd rather have my ass kissed up in Bloomingdale

You can go be a pimp, you can go be a hoe

But you only gon' get paid off what you know

If you don't know shit, then you can't work for me

Cause you read your first book in the penitentiary

Why the fuck you wanna murrr-dah me?

Your punk ass never heard of me

I never did nuttin to your family

Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly

You wanna take the life God handed to me

Send it back to him cause you ain't a fan of me

Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me

That's a animal, a fuckin cannibal

I'm Geronimo and Hannibal, with international

gangster pull, I'm a bull in Barcelona

with a Corona, youse a fake-ass nigga

Where's your owner? I'm a real live man

You a persona, now I'm a goner

Call my momma, and the coroner

Mr. Gun Man, your plan is workin

Cause niggaz is dyin, and mommas is hurtin



[Chorus - sung]

Why you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me

You don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree

Now - sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you & me

You never know who you facin, who you chasin, the life you wastin



[Ice Cube]

I was made by the one and only G-O-D

To take my life, to the T-O-P

Now here comes a motherfuckin D-O-G

who ain't happy 'til a nigga is R.I.P.

Tryin to be somethin he saw on BET

Either T.I.P., or B.I.G.

I don't give a fuck what you saw on TV

but a one-eight-seven don't make an O.G.

I'm an O.G., never had to fake it

God gave me this, how you gon' take it?

What'chu gon' tell 'em, when you get to heaven

and he asks you why did you send back his present?

Who the fuck are you~? You motherfuckin peasant!

Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing

Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes

Nigga hell on earth is bein stuck in the 80's



[Chorus]



[Ice Cube]

Before you shoot me man think about it

Let's go have a drink about it

Before you make a stink about it

Man let's talk about it maybe we can walk up out it

But just don't be a coward

And take my life, cause you got the power

of the white man's gunpowder

Cause you might face a gun tower

And time never run out

They take the fun out, 'til your life run out

So don't pull the gun out

If you ever want a house just like Run's house

It's better than the big house

Let's go find some women we can dig out

Find a place we can pig out

Party all night 'til the owner say get out

Dedicated to all the niggaz

That's dead and don't know why

Who wanna look at the nigga who shot 'em

And ask these questions

Why me homey, why me?"

They say ""Gangster, gangster! Tell me how you do it

How you get through it and them other niggaz blew it""

I keep my eye on the prize then pursue it

Chase it like a cheetah chuck it out and subdue it

So self-educate, nigga don't hate

Cause the game I got, is Madden oh-eight

Fuck with Cube, I'm better than YouTube

Fuck with them dudes them niggaz is new school

The game don't change just the players

The rhymes don't change just the fuckin rhymesayers

(Hahahaha!) They make it up as they go along

But I'm goin on 25 years strong

The shit I say might get you through the day

Or change your whole life, in a major way

The shit they say, might catch you a case

The shit I say, feel like your birthday

You know what? Momma said it'd be days like this

Straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss

She said ""Don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall

All they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers""

It's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket

If it's another hustle out there I'ma crack it

Fuck the new dance I'ma learn how to eat

Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin streets

They keep callin me

They keep callin, all the lil' homies keep fallin

In them same traps niggaz cain't figure out

In the fast lane boy but the bridge is out

Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled

Get you in the system, get you in the soil

And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal

Saw you UVN, nigga digital

[Ice Cube]

I know, it's fucked up how they do us

Pretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis

Take that money that was allocated to us

Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us

Watchin Katrina, is worser than Ike & Tina

See New Orleans get bitchslapped by FEMA

Louisiana got racist-ass politics

Free the Jena Six (NIGGA FREE THE JENA SIX~!)

Your honor, Osama, Obama

Even, yo' momma, ain't fuckin with my comments

They want us to quit, forget

And not give a shit about these sick-ass politics

A lunatic is in the White House

Make me wanna go do a lick right now

But they'll make a nigga bow down

in the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry

Just face it, put me to the test

Fuck a Rockstar! We wanna party like a Rap Star

In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)

Don't forget the grand fact that I am a grinder

And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya

Nothin' motherfucker just don't act like a vagina

You won't catch the wrath of this hardcore rhymer

Now you got fifty-five niggers right behind ya

You ain't nothin' to play with, nigger that be the basics

[Ice Cube]
If you try to get with me, pull a four and a fifty
Fuck your monkey ass up, like Bobby did Whitney
Trigger fingers get itchy, when niggaz get bitchy

And they need they story told on Jerry or Ricki

Pull your green in your iffy, I'm clean and I'm spiffy

If they lock me up today I'll be back in a jiffy

All my niggaz that's with me, all my bitches are picky

To ride around us right on time, bitch you know it's tricky

Take a hit of the sticky, everybody get tipsy

When we hittin' that whiskey, all my niggaz get pissy

Don't fuck with no sissy, all we bumpin' is missy

If you know where I am, motherfucker come get me

I'm a man not a Mickey, all my niggaz love hickies

that don't go away 'til you're well in your sixties

All I'm wearin' is Dickies, don't try to evict me

When we come to Atlanta we gon' re-open Nikki's



[Chorus - X2]

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it



[W.C.]

Barracuda with it, call security

Fuck the dress code, I'm in a white T with jewelry

Hand to my side with my nine, sat lyin' back

In the club with your baby mama in my lap

Lookin' fly like I got a pocket full of stones

Pro fitted on, wearin' chronic cologne

Big watch, big rocks, grip glocks, dick guap

What you niggaz thought, motherfucker this is Lench Mob

Dub make the trigger knock, talk shit

I'll put additional air condition holes in your Bentley top

And shorty got 'em gettin' low, I rich rolls

Swervin' on them MVP's, I call 'em Kobe's cause they 24's

Still spittin' out sunflowers, Dub and Don Dadda

Bustin' more gun powder than gun towers

Down South, y'all can Screw it, it's the West, too truest

Keep the party jumpin' like do it fluid and never lose it



[Chorus - X2]

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it



[The Game]

Who my gangsta rap teacher? (Ice Cube) Nigga you better know it

It's the Don Dadda Jr. slash motherfuckin' poet

Sit back and take notes while I spin like hundred spokes

My flow is razor sharp, I'm comin' straight for your throat

With that West Coast, gangbang, watch him when his chain hang

East Coast, Down South, niggaz do the same thang

Throw up your dubs like Wu-Tang, who bang

harder than that nigga bailin' through your hood with two chains

Swangin' like his nuts, 'cause he don't give a fuck

Bout no nigga that ain't bangin' in no khakis or some Chuck's

It's that Westside, Connect'd with that nigga who flow so wreckless

He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I'll bet this

motherfuckin' Coast ain't got shit after me

Ain't have shit before Cube except a W.C.

The Maad Circle is back, with mad purple in fact

I'm bout to join the Lench Mob, that's me squirtin' the mac, motherfuckers



[Chorus - X2]

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it"

All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard
The West coast warlord, and the future is today
Cause tomorrow - that shit never come
I worry 'bout today and this urban decay

I worry 'bout hip-hop, when did it flip-flop

Get whack, and turn into gridlock

I don't know is it a government plot?

I don't give a fuck whether you love it or not

That's all we got and if you throw it away

You dumb as OJ, off a for-tay

In your Izod, this the rap God

What'chu gon' put up, in your iPod?

Downloader, what'chu gon' do

when your favorite MC, got to sue you

Cause he got to eat ain't nuttin taboo

Get your ass beat by Erykah Badu

Cause you wanna steal this good music

Put me out of business, now you lose it



[Chorus: sung with ad libs]

Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout tomorrow (that shit never come)

This is very hard to swallow

Keep your hand up on that throttle

Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow



[Ice Cube]

Tomorrow, I'ma handle my business

But today, I'ma drink this liquor

Cause tomorrow, I might be a little quicker

But today, I'm just the same old nigga

You know that shit is still a day away

Do yo' thang baby put your life on layaway

Cause everybody is Nostradamus

Boy don't you know that tomorrow ain't promised?

To all the lil' mamas

Don't do a nigga, like Isiah Thomas

If you a bitch, please be honest

Actin like a hoe you're not an an-gel

While you're, daydreamin 'bout your future

Motherfucker come around the corner and shoot you

Don'tcha, get stuck in neutral

Put your shit in drive, while you still alive cause



[Chorus]



[Ice Cube]

Tomorrow~! That shit never come

I know it sounds strange but today is never done

I'm up in the Range when the clock strikes 1

While y'all countin sheep, I'm countin Benja-mons

Up on my feet at the break of the sun

President of the Gangster Na-tion

We don't go to war, we go to the store

We rob from the rich, and give to the poor

Hip-Hop, oh what a bore

Lettin college motherfuckers run the front door

(Fuck that!) Let's take it back to the streets

Don't let Viacom, dictate the heat

The nerve of them, I never heard of dem

Askin me about, my urban spins

And if I got about, a thousand of them

I'm a crate MC, accordin to them

Fuck that!



[Chorus - repeat 2X]



[Ice Cube - over last repeat to fade]

All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard

The West coast warlord, the future is today

Now is the time...
C'mon y'all
Stand tall, live your life to the limit
Cause haterism seem like a fucking epidemic

And look at Ice Cube, I ain't no gimmick

I'm straight from the hood, I got to represent it

Now - every day I think about my color

And all the crazy shit we do to one another

I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your cuz brother

Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother

If not, we gon' pull these triggers

Show the world we deserve to be called niggaz

I make a fuck-up, like Don Imus

bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness

You can too, you got the power to

Don't let this motherfuckin system devour you

I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowin you

But check it out I understand what you goin through



[Chorus: sung from samples]

But remember, brothers and sisters

You can still, stand, tall

Just be thankful...

For what you got



[Ice Cube]

I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh

Here comes another rapper with a song about hope

All you wanna hear is a song about dope

And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope

But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap

No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note

Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes

And some of our people used to hang from trees

Now the only thing hangin muh'fucker is DEEZ

So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right

Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke

I'm the sunlight, too bright to look

When it's all said and done I should write the book

You too cool for school, too old to know?

Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow

I understand, it ain't no love lost

But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus



[Chorus]



[Ice Cube]

Yeah, f'real

I was born in the mud but I came out clean

That's 'til the government tried to intervene

Tried to lock me up when I was only 19

Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream

I make shit raw that piss off the law

If you want some fake shit turn this off

If you want some realness I know you can feel this

Maybe we can heal this just like an illness

Black on black, I got'cho back

People don't think that we know how to act

Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack

And the CIA, won't take it back

Never on top, always on the bottom

Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham

Cause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten

Keep on pushin, get 'em 'til we got 'em



[Chorus]



[Ice Cube]

Stand up, f'real...

Raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit

Heh, in the belly of the evil empire [fades]"

Hahaha, today was a good day
Know what?, sometimes I just get on my knees
You know what I mean?

And pray to the man with the master plan

To swoop on down (swoop on down)

On that mothership, scoop a nigga up...



Lord have mercy, my people so thirsty

Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Muhammad

All we get is vomit, come like a comet

Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach

Only you can run it, I'ma learn from it

Do what I gotta do, try not to plummet

America eats its youth like reptiles

Don't worry bout tomorrow, let's get this right now

They want to run us in the ground

Educate yourself before they dumb you down

Get your money boy, the legal way

Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may

Now rich white men they got the world fucked up

Why should I give a fuck about a styrofoam cup?

Environmental scene, I'll keep it clean

But if I go green, you know what I mean, bitch

Let's just do it for the hell of it

See how I'd run the government - make money irrelevant

I might tell a chick, it's illegal to be celibate

Secret Service don't know where the hell I went

Sorry y'all, I had to fuck a Superdelegate

Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama

American dream, Ice Cube and yo' mama

The Terminator, are you Sarakana?

Arnold Schwarzenegger, can kill who he wanna?

In California, they strap you to a gurney

And murder yo' ass, in front of your attorney

Do you really wanna take this journey?

Ain't scared of none of y'all motherfuckers like Bernie

Mac (step back) Step back, I got the Mac-11

Unlike Obama, I'ma have to back my reverand

Now the Lord is my shepherd, my flow is respected

Worldwide, from the West I got to rep it

So please check it, 'cause my style is infected

with the virus, Ice Cube's the Osiris

I bail through, they wanna put me up in Bellevue

Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue

It's black and blue residue

I know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue

Speak on it and they'll get mad at you

You think I do this bullshit for your gratitude?

I'm a Nigga With a Attitude

I'ma do what I gotta do just to change my latitude

Pimp the system, rollin' with my diamonds glistenin'

And niggaz listenin', from your local prison

I'm a prism, your only vision is a rainbow

in the sky when I spit the ism, come on

[Verse 1]

I'm from the land of the gang bang

Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed

It's the same ol same

Bush run shit like Sadaam Hussien

I cock and aim, clinically insane

To deal with this bullshit day to day

If I sell some yay or smoke some hay

You bitches wanna throw me up in pelican's bay

Call me an animal up in the system

But who's the animal that built this prison

Who's the animal that invented lower living

The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons

Thank god for Sugarhill

I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill

Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids

How these ghetto niggaz taken over showbiz



[Chorus]



[Verse 2]

It's boyz in the hood, it's toys in the hood

Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood

Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood

Nigga killed a crip and a blood in the hood (For real)

Cause when niggaz get tribal

It's all about survival, nobody liable

I got caught by five-oh

Grandmama came to court with her bible

But when the judge hit the gavel

Now I'm too far from my family to travel (Fuck)

I just came unraveled

Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled

Owned by C.A, State Property

Just like the year fifteen fifty three

Looking for me, a one-way ticket out

Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?



[Chorus]



[Verse 3]

(Damn) I can't take the pressure

Pulled the fo-fo up out the dresser

Grabbed the weight up out the closet

Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it

Y'all know what happened last time I lost it

Can't tell you niggaz what the fuckin boss did

The game got a nigga exhausted

Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered

Twenty years for what?

Breaking these laws that's so corrupt

Taking these halls and fillin 'em up

Some powder cake shit that's about to erupt

Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck

Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?

In the hood, don't press your luck

Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

We got over two million motherfuckers locked up
(Let me out this motherfucker) Stop snitchin

Now how many MC's must get booed

Before somebody say don't fuck with Cube (you know!)

I'll strip you nude (butt-ass) in your living room

Face down, paralyzed from the waist down

I'm a buckin clown, but don't fuck around

Doin movies now, but I'll lay you down

South Central style, pull them thangs out

Don't make a millionare have to send you there

You know the story of the tortoise nigga and the hare

Nigga run nigga run never get there

I'ma walk, fuck a bitch when I get there

Nigga this a marathon, ask Farrakhan

Fuck the cemetery that I'm buried on (fuck 'em)

The blood of Ice Cube got to carry on (forever)

Forever what the fuck are they yellin?

""Gangsta Gangsta,"" nigga stop tellin - stop snitchin



[Chorus]

You can have whatever you want

In the hood, it's do's and don'ts

So when it get hot in this kitchen

Stop snitchin, nigga stop snitchin



[Ice Cube]

Microphone master, super rhyme maker

Gun blaster, who's the life taker (who?)

Who the fuck is a lifetime Laker?

I slap the Maybeline off Tammy Faye Baker

Who the fuck got more than an acre?

In Los Angeles I got to have paper

I'm a nigga, don't talk to my neighbors

Straight asshole, always up in Vegas (yay yay)

Lay it out for these niggaz to follow

Get the point, but these points is hollow

Now this here, is hard to swallow

But if you do it's like hittin the lotto

Little nigga with big bravado

Hit the throttle niggaz hit the bottle

Can give a fuck if they life is hollow

Where the fuck was you, when I rocked the Apollo, bitch?



Ay, who put this thing together? Me, that's who

Who I trust? Who I trust? ME, THAT'S WHO!



Nigga nigga nigga, can't you see

Somehow your words incarcerate me

Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee

Lock me up in my prime, Muhammad Ali

Get out whup yo' ass like Muhammad Ali

Rumble in the Jungle, nigga don't play Dumbo

In the hood nigga known as Columbo

Get the people on the phone, tell the jumble

Spit fluid and swear he didn't do it

Got my bottom bitch locked up with Martha Stewart

She say she had the hoe cookin deep dish

She say Martha fuckin cook fish and eat fish

Westside y'all niggaz got to peep this

That's your weakness, can't keep a secret

Don't say shit, boy that's basic

They want to send a nigga back to the slave ship

Stop snitchin



[Chorus]



[New Chorus]

You can have whatever you choose

But out here, it's don'ts and do's

So after we finish this mission

Stop snitchin, nigga stop snitchin

Blacks who ventured across the unmarked border were often attacked 
by teenage members of the new gang called The Spook Hunters, 
one of a handful of white gangs active in this time. 
It was only natural for L.A.'s newest residents to respond unkind. 


[Unknown] 

As white attacks started to increase in the mid 1940's and late 1940's 

blacks started to organize their clubs really as a defensive mechanism. 

And the boss men or the business men and the Snyder boys and all these 

clubs in south L.A. really were just sorta defending themselves against 

white violence that was coming from Huntington Park and Southgate. 



[William Shatner] 

The demise of the black panthers in Los Angeles is said to be another 

blow to a generation of black teenagers that witnessed many of its role models 

assasinated throughout the 1960's. 



[Ice Cube] spoken 

What I'm sayin in so many words, they shoulda let the panthers 

went on because there probably would never have been no crips and no bloods. 



[Transition to ""Growin' Up"" Clean Version] 



[Ice Cube] 

Ha ha, that's my 

Turn it up [echoes] 

Uhh, yeah 



I hear a beat like this, and think about growin up 

House parties, with gangbangers showin up 

Represent your hood, everybody throw it up 

They say Cube get on the mic, blow it up 

I used to lyrical, political 

But now you want it sugarcoated like cereal 

First I met Dre, then I met Yella (yessir) 

Dr. Dre made me rap acapella 

Me and Jinx did a show at Dudo's

With K-Dee, I think it was two shows 

Then Dre introduced me to E 

Cruisin down the street in his red Jeep 

He said, yo we should flip it like this 

Cause them Boyz N the Hood like the gangsta 

I put the pen to the pad, young was raw 

And told the world how we felt about the law 

It was real 



[Chorus 2X: samples + (Cube)] 

I see the happiness (all day every day) 

I see the pain 

Where am I (growin up in the hood) 

Back down memory lane 



[Ice Cube] 

Oh, it's B.W.! 

Them on tour and they comin our way 

Little one is still tucked away 

In that trailer park, just bumpin our tape 

Jerry Heller tried to make his escape 

I had to bounce, while other got raped 

Same turned around and said me 

No you cause I'm down with Chuck D 

And I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic 

When I hit the screen, it was magic 

Never thought I'd see Eazy in a casket 

Thanks for everythang, that's on everythang 

I learned a lot of game from you 

I like your son, he got his name from you 

I tell him everythang that he need to know 

If he ask my advice, I won't think twice homey 



[Chorus: samples + (Cube)] 

I see the happiness (all day every day) 

I see the pain 

Where am I (growin up in the hood) 

Back down memory lane 



[Ice Cube] 

From Boyz N the Hood , to XXX 2 

Everybody wanna know my next move 

Fans all around say ""We love you Cube!"" 

I wanna take time to say I love you too 

I love all my fans cause they know I'm a man 

And not a little boy or some play toy 

A lot of say I grew up on you 

And let me know if anybody wit you 

Cause you talk a lot of about the red, black & blue 

And how they treat a called Katrina, did you see her 

White folks worry 'bout them misdemeanor 

While black people dyin in that God dang arena 

Just because I'm actin never stop rappin 

It's in my blood homey, I'ma keep the party crackin 

Money keep stackin 'til they put me in a casket 

Who you think you wit? Here's another classic 



[Chorus: samples + (Cube)] 

I see the happiness (all day every day) 

I see the pain 

Where am I (growin up in the hood)

When you leave the parking lot, check ya limbs

You better check ya friends

Blacks and Mexicans - stop all that bullshit in the pen

Understand that is us verse them

They can give a fuck if we sink or swim

They give us guns and drugs

In South Central, Los Angeles - Grandmama smoke cannabis

Granddaughter wanna dance and shit, her own momma can't stand the bitch

[Ice Cube (verse one)]

I know ya like to see me doin' bad

But i'm doin' good, fuck the police that's rollin' thru my neighborhood

Fuckin' peaker wood see me in the five speed

I don't care if his motherfuckin' eyes bleed (yeah yeah!)

This is my weed, this is my world

Don't get mad when you see them hundred spokes twirl

Candied out while you spit yo' last on the pearl

The Don Daada, i'm hotta than holly watta

Wish i was your baby fatha, cuz i got a fuckin' head on my shoulder

And lead in my holster, face on the poster

The kinda nigga that you wanna get close ta'

But you can't so you start the lyin'

Just like that nigga that think he dyin'

Get ta cryin', snitchin' and testifyin'

To all my people if i'm talkin 'bout your baby mama

When she meet Ice Cube tell her save the drama



[Chris Rock]

Yo Cube, im goan have all da biches here



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--



Yo man fuck dem bitches, dey ain't call me back

But i just paged my auntie



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--



[Ice Cube]

Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--



Tell your cousin, tell your sister, if she want me



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--



[Ice Cube (verse two)]

I'm a be as real as I can with this

Not just the fake analyst on canabis, who only say that the world is

Scandalist, without findin' out a way to handle this

Dismantle this, either with the rhyme or the fist

How the fuck we get in the belly of this bitch?

I be rich if it wasn't for the snitch

Lyin' to the enemies, wild conspiracies

I'm a say this 'till the day that I die

Seven thirty fives bring on bitches lies

While you bullshitin', I'm hard hittin' like

2pac, I keep spittin' 'till my heart stop

Young niggas tryin' to tell me that i'm played

Once they say you played, nigga you must be payed (HA HA! huh ha)

Pushin' weight since the tenth grade do my thing

Got more plaques than Jordan got rings, nigga sayin'



[Chris Rock]

Yo Cube, i got the new Biz 9000



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--



I got the Playstation in the windshield nigga!



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--

Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--



Tell your cousin, tell your sister, if she want me



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--



[Ice Cube (verse three)]

I hate to see your ass comin' (yep), with your mouth runnin'

Talkin' 'bout somethin' (what?), that ain't meanin' nothin'

'Bout your second cousin (hmm), who be always buzzin'

Where she was or wasn't, who she now fuckin'

Stories by the dozen Punch you got the sequel (what?)

To let you tell it Randy Moss is your people

It's evident, your ass lie like the president

But stretch marks on your mouth is the evidence (ha ha)

How the fuck can your friends be the benjamins?! (punk)

And your little ass car's full of fender benz

There you go on the stand with your hand up (lyin')

Testifyin' about a man that's in handcuffs

We should do you like the Mack said

And if he lie like a crackhead pop 'em like a black head

Let him ooze, let him loose

Let him lie by his motherfuckin' ass on the news (yeah yeah)



[Chris Rock]

Yo Cube, check out this ring, 69 karots



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--



It's Kryptonite nigga, Kryptonite!



--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--

Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie

Niggas want that gutter shit

Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit

Ain't the rugged shit [repeat]



[verse one]

Keep it gangsta y'all, I want to thank you all

Niggas comin' with that bullshit, it's gankin' y'all

We can ride to this kinda shit and bank them all

Nigga ball 'till you fall motherfucker thats all

Can't none of y'all hang with me putin' in work

Turn this motherfucker up unless you goin' to church

Nowadays, crazy ass bitches want they bills paid

But can't even make a good thang of kool-aid (ha ha)

But chicken heads get chicken feed (bahk bakh)

(a) Lil' dick and weed (bahk bakh)

Everything that a chicken need (bahk bakh)

Tryin' to pot I get real as Chris Rock

Make a bitch hot, turn into Fort Knox (bitch know)

It's Ice Cube comin' straight from the gutter

Westcoast Don, you fags undastata (?)



[Jayo (verse two)]

There is sa-lethal in the gas chamber

I'm full of anger, nigga the west is in the house

But you still in for some danger

And when i'm thru, I take your bitch and finger bang her

But if she looks tossed up, i'll slang her

Beat you like mama dearest with a clothes hanger

Cuz the gang a niggas be tryin' to spit

But you can't spit it like this

I come equiped to rip, any battle

And leave him strung in his crew

but they put me in the twist like Trump

I can collapse or puncture, the lungs of anyone

Give him a chance to spit his last word, unerve

then he done

20/20 ain't good enough

Rappers they ain't seein' me, this Jay-O Felony

And nobody can stand three of me

Caution keep MC's out of my reach, i'm on a mission

And be gettin' to your fuckin' hide to be called a physician

Immediately, I puts it down at a show (Jay-O)

But loked to choke the shit out a fool, nigga dat's on doo low

Niggas notice, as soon as you're checking quotas

We the coldest, so go and tell the rollers (biotch!)



[Gangsta (verse four)]

Who dat? next out the game, in blue kahks

Gangsta's the name, niggas wonderin' how I do that

By the thug way, package and transportin' the drug way

Only means of makin' a livin', the Crip and Blood way

I'm on grates when i'm grindin'

I'm on stakes when i'm dinnin'

And on sunday's on the wine

Is you can't calm the savage beast (never)

And I can make your birds rise like geese, K-Mac tell 'em

You sell 'em, I swell 'em, loke (sell 'em loke)

Hard or soft determines how much a nigga sell 'em for

We got the fish scale texture (fish scale)

Now if you cook it yourself you get extras

Dub that shit to death with this dub thang

Only a few niggas left with this love mang

So we cop together (yeah), put it in the beeker

Rock together (uhh), claim blocks together

And fuck cock together, nigga (brrrph!)

Got to handle money, got to stack the money (tell 'em)

Million dollar tickets make bitches look wicked

So you innocent hoes, ain't got to like ta kick it

I know you knows (uhh), cuz now my decimals (yep)

Done fiend for the green, keep you itchin' in your panty hose

Your eyes full of gleem (brrrmmph!)

You wanna get on my team, and live my dream

Captain of the ship is what i'm boastin'

Hit the three wheel motion, i'm the shit when i'm coastin' (uh huh)

Down the boulevard, flossin' hard

Lights hit the chrome, don't go lick 'em like a movie star

Money makes me a savage (what it do?)

Look into my eyes if you wanna know me

Before you hypnotized, homey what do you see

A figure that's just a little bigger than dealers

A hustler countin figures ain't pulled no triggers

Can you dig us, we be the ultimate lick

We's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits

Kinda floss-ey, kinda boss-ey

It's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say

Top of the pyramid, homey what I tell you

If you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar

Bring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe

and I could rule the world with my eyes closed

(with my eyes closed..)

I see you tryin to be a O.G. like me

Chasin dreams, pullin mo' schemes for wealth

But the best thing in life is health, be yourself playa

Television it'll keep yo' ass wishin forever

You'll never get you life together

Don't talk about death, I got too much life to live

Too many orders to give -- what it is, showbiz

Taught you what a trick and a hoe is (WHAT?)

Showed you what a Six-ty Fo' is (WHAT?)

Lord knows, ""In God We Trust""

and everybody in the world wanna be like us (everybody)



[Chorus]



[Ice Cube]

To the kids of the world that's waitin for wealth

Waitin for health, you better do for self

Homey that's yo' last cup

Forget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up

People use yo' brain to gain

Do something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's

Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones

Throw away the guns, have nuttin but fun

And homey we could do that {shit}!

Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit

We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own

Send your baby to school and she'll come back grown

We got to talk to our grandma's

And she'll help us throught them dark halls, and them pitfalls

Everybody know we got the world to gain

We got to stop the pain, lord stop the rain

Keep goin, little homey why you slowin?

Keep rollin, little homey why you slowin?

Keep rollin, little homey why you slowin?

Now all I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones

The thug ones, relatives and my cousins

And I got 'em by the dozen

When they buzzin', quick to say fuck your husband

This is for my niggas locked away

Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date

But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great

As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe

Fuck them license plates because life is great

It don't matter if you're rich and your folks ain't straight

I'm still coming with that underground gangsta shit

No matter how many niggas say we ain't the shit, bitch

I do hard core rhyming, hard time grinding

With will I pimp hoes

Other niggas wine and dine them

Gotta love this pup shit

Passing the mud shit

Pockets on flood shit

OG lyrical blood shit

I don't rent I buy shit

Niggas jealous of my shit

You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit

While you're rooting and recruiting

Nigga 6-8 whooping

I was in the hood shooting cause I had the wife whooping

I come from padres gold in oversized jars

I past up strife and got star awards

No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing

Came out the substation to the hip hop nation

The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga

Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga

Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it

I keep pushing, don't quit it

Don't stop till I get it

(Ice Cube)

Don't stop get it, get it

[verse one]

Stab thru the neighborhood, these spinin'

Weez winin', scrap with the John Lennon

Head rests, TV's in 'em

Best in the nation, on this playstation

The Don Daata, gotta get you hotter

Been a buck naked nigga smokin' water

On a friday, the get high day

Blowin' at a hot date, findin' Shade

Black and bicantay, with ass everwhere, how you do that there?

A sight to behold, break the mold

Just tryin' to get some before the world explode

I see you tryin' to get caught

Well shake what your mama gave ya, plus what you bought

We fuck and we fought, we laugh and we cry

Told the truth and we lie



[chorus]

You be good to me, i'll be good to you

Anything you want, anything you do

I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you

Give it all I got, and to keep it hot



[verse two]

Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?

Explain it to your family

It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--

You know you ain't right standin' at the light

Think it's chocolate with that shit too tight

And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me

Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me

Now see the haterism increase

They hate when you got a dime piece

And I got one shotgun, and I might catch a hot one

When i'm lookin' for love and niggas got none, uhh

If you let me handcuff your wrist

Bonnie and Clyde ain't got shit on this

Cuz Bonnie and Clyde had to take a risk

But most of my money see it's all legit --baby--

It's all about your state of mind

Now what would you do if I handed you a tech nine?

Are you feelin' me?

Would you stay down like Hillary?

Even if you thought about killin' me?



[chorus]

You be good to me, i'll be good to you

Anything you want, anything you do

I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you

Give it all I got, and to keep it hot



[verse three]

Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?

Explain it to your family

It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--

Are you the type of girl that would call them folks

Have your man leave the house in chains and ropes

Don't need the kind of girl that'll have me in court

On lawsuits lyin' about demestic abuse

Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin' me out

Garnish my cheques, reposses my lex

Cuz I come from a place in southern Californi

Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni

But fuck the world don't aks me for shit

Unless you my boo, and i'm fuckin' you

The rest of these broads ain't knowin'

That i'm a have you bumpin' Lauryn, in somethin' foreign

Come thru blow the horn

Stick your wrists out the window

And wave to your kinfolks

Let 'em know who you with

And to your crazy ass daddy, let him know who to get



[chorus]

You be good to me, i'll be good to you

Anything you want, anything you do

I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you

Give it all I got, and to keep it hot



Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?

Explain it to your family

Please listen to my demo [x8]
A nigga told me, the record company's the pimp
The artist is the hoe, The stage is the corner
And the audience is the trip, god damn



[verse one]

Incredible young nigga, you can't belive i'm just one nigga

God damn i've gotten bigger

Intellect superior,

Walk in a room and make the whole interior, inferior

If you look me in my eyes

You might fuck around and loose control of your mind body and your soul

Grab ahold

Undisputed on the microphone, what choo think

If you wink, i'll make you ich think

Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter

Shotgun enima, this ain't no cinema

All praises due to the creator

--for this man here, that can't no nigga stand near--

True, inventor of the double-you

What choo wanna do, i got the red and the blue

Show me one nigga dedicated to raps

I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps

Record company death traps settin' decoys

Just to pimp young b-boys

With a cup full of yak, studio contact

Maniac with a contract

Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble

About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level

Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in

And take all my publishin', god damn

Do i take it up the rectum

Just to rock the spectrum

Give up a right arm, just to do a form

Hell no, all you motherfukers goan leave this bitch limpin'

No more, record company pimpin'



No more (No more), record company pimpin'

No more (No more), record company pimpin'

No more (No more), record company pimpin'

You ain't pimpin' me (uhn uhh, uhn uhh)

[verse two]

I'ma keep it simple, it went from ""please listen to my demo""

To ""get your ass out my limo""

Stretch presidential

It's essential cuz the record company will have your ass in a rental

If you let 'em, You have to behead 'em

Contracts you never read 'em

CEO's you never met 'em

Sent to an atourney, Burnstein and Burney

Nigga that's his lawyer, ain't got nothin' for ya

Treat ya like they emloy ya, i'm a warrior

Bite you in the ass like a Georgetown Hoya

When they ignore ya cause, you got to hold your balls

Catch a motherfucker slippin' in bathroom stalls

And then you show 'em that you ain't a rookie

Let 'em know that you'd rather have, more points than more pussy

Pimp turned bookie

Now how the fuck i get in so much debt

God damn, we just met

Welcome to the rap game

Motherfucker be confused and broke before he know whats happenin'

You can be the star and fuck women

I'ma just play the back and keep winnin'



No more (No more), record company pimpin'

See these shoes you wanna try on, try on

Yo, we can go to war with the enemy

All we need is A.K.s and Hennessy

This ain't back in the days of Tennessee

Pull the trigger and release the energy [shots]

See muthafuckas run till they catch one

In the back, and it might cause a cardiac

Bitch act like he died and we brought him back

Him screamin for his mama and his sister pack

Flatline -

Make me pull out my gat, right

Here's another verse to choke on, choke on

To all my niggas in the pen, get your yoke on

To all my thugs in the house, get your loc on

We can really give a fuck about a broke home

All we care about is bitches we can poke on

Nigga, what's that bullshit that you spoke on?

Better roll on 'fore we split your whole dome

Cause you're fuckin with Ice Cube the Terrible

Fuck around, I make your life unbearable

Make you live all scary and careful

Come through my neighborhood, you better tip-toe

Cause if you loud, then you might get chased down

To all my niggas with the lleyo

They rock it up like Play-Doh

They cook it up like Waco

Better do what I say so

Better lay low, cause you fuckin with a halo

Death to the niggas with the big mouth

And death to you devils from the Old South

And death to you hoes turnin tricks out

And death everyone that go the bitch route

Check it

If you infected by this record

Bow down butt-naked

And pray to God

Ice Cube won't spare the rod

Don't get mad when you see them hundred spokes twirl

Candied out while you spit yo' last on the pearl

And lead in my holster, face on the poster

But you can't so you start the lyin'

'Bout your second cousin (hmm), who be always buzzin'

Where she was or wasn't, who she now fuckin'

Stories by the dozen Punch you got the sequel (what?)

To let you tell it Randy Moss is your people

It's evident, your ass lie like the president

But stretch marks on your mouth is the evidence (ha ha)

How the fuck can your friends be the benjamins?! (punk)

And your little ass car's full of fender benz

There you go on the stand with your hand up (lyin')

Testifyin' about a man that's in handcuffs

We should do you like the Mack said

And if he lie like a crackhead pop 'em like a black head

Let him ooze, let him loose

Let him lie by his motherfuckin' ass on the news (yeah yeah)

The best thing in life in life is life (uh-huh, uh-huh)

Get your mind right, and get your grind right (we gotta keep goin)

[Krazyie] Hey young thugs (we gotta keep goin)

Get your mind right, and get your grind right

[Krazyie] Hey young thugs..

Get your mind right, and get your grind right



[Ice Cube]

Look into my eyes if you wanna know me

Before you hypnotized, homey what do you see

A figure that's just a little bigger than dealers

A hustler countin figures ain't pulled no triggers

Can you dig us, we be the ultimate lick

We's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits

Kinda floss-ey, kinda boss-ey

It's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say

Top of the pyramid, homey what I tell you

If you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar

Bring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe

and I could rule the world with my eyes closed

(with my eyes closed..)



[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]



See the mission's to get what we don't got

until we filthy rich and on top --

-- you betta go get it, it's yours

Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got

The struggle it don't stop until we drop

[Ice Cube]

To all the little homies that's watchin TV

I see you tryin to be a O.G. like me

Chasin dreams, pullin mo' schemes for wealth

But the best thing in life is health, be yourself playa

Television it'll keep yo' ass wishin forever

You'll never get you life together

Don't talk about death, I got too much life to live

Too many orders to give -- what it is, showbiz

Taught you what a trick and a hoe is (WHAT?)

Showed you what a Six-ty Fo' is (WHAT?)

Lord knows, ""In God We Trust""

and everybody in the world wanna be like us (everybody)



[Chorus]



[Ice Cube]

To the kids of the world that's waitin for wealth

Waitin for health, you better do for self

Homey that's yo' last cup

Forget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up

People use yo' brain to gain

Do something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's

Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones

Throw away the guns, have nuttin but fun

And homey we could do that {shit}!

Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit

We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own

Send your baby to school and she'll come back grown

We got to talk to our grandma's

And she'll help us throught them dark halls, and them pitfalls

Everybody know we got the world to gain

We got to stop the pain, lord stop the rain



[Chorus]



[Ice Cube]

Keep goin, little homey why you slowin?

Keep rollin, little homey why you slowin?

Keep rollin, little homey why you slowin?

Keep rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin

But if you think we high, nigga think again

Cause when it's sink or swim

You got to think to win

And if I drink this Hen'

Everybody will know it

Cause I ain't going for it

So pray to the Lord that I don't pull out

Cuss out and bust out

When they buzzin', quick to say fuck your husband

Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date

But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great

As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe

Fuck them license plates because life is great

Gotta love this pup shit

Passing the mud shit

Pockets on flood shit

OG lyrical blood shit

I don't rent I buy shit

Niggas jealous of my shit

You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit

While you're rooting and recruiting

Nigga 6-8 whooping

I was in the hood shooting cause I had the wife whooping

I come from padres gold in oversized jars

I past up strife and got star awards

No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing

Came out the substation to the hip hop nation

The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga

Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga

Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it

Don't stop till I get it

Best in the nation, on this playstation

The Don Daata, gotta get you hotter

Been a buck naked nigga smokin' water

On a friday, the get high day

Blowin' at a hot date, findin' Shade

Black and bicantay, with ass everwhere, how you do that there?

A sight to behold, break the mold

Just tryin' to get some before the world explode

I see you tryin' to get caught

Well shake what your mama gave ya, plus what you bought

We fuck and we fought, we laugh and we cry

Told the truth and we lie

Explain it to your family

It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--

You know you ain't right standin' at the light

Think it's chocolate with that shit too tight

And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me

Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me

Now see the haterism increase

They hate when you got a dime piece

And I got one shotgun, and I might catch a hot one

When i'm lookin' for love and niggas got none, uhh

If you let me handcuff your wrist

Bonnie and Clyde ain't got shit on this

Cuz Bonnie and Clyde had to take a risk

But most of my money see it's all legit --baby--

It's all about your state of mind

Now what would you do if I handed you a tech nine?

Are you feelin' me?

Would you stay down like Hillary?

Even if you thought about killin' me?

Are you the type of girl that would call them folks

Have your man leave the house in chains and ropes

Don't need the kind of girl that'll have me in court

On lawsuits lyin' about demestic abuse

Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin' me out

Garnish my cheques, reposses my lex

Cuz I come from a place in southern Californi

Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni

But fuck the world don't aks me for shit

Unless you my boo, and i'm fuckin' you

The rest of these broads ain't knowin'

That i'm a have you bumpin' Lauryn, in somethin' foreign

And wave to your kinfolks

A nigga told me, the record company's the pimp
The artist is the hoe, The stage is the corner
And the audience is the trip, god damn

Incredible young nigga, you can't belive i'm just one nigga

God damn i've gotten bigger

Intellect superior,

Walk in a room and make the whole interior, inferior

If you look me in my eyes

You might fuck around and loose control of your mind body and your soul

Grab ahold

Undisputed on the microphone, what choo think

If you wink, i'll make you ich think

Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter

Shotgun enima, this ain't no cinema

All praises due to the creator

--for this man here, that can't no nigga stand near--

True, inventor of the double-you

What choo wanna do, i got the red and the blue

Show me one nigga dedicated to raps

I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps

Record company death traps settin' decoys

Just to pimp young b-boys

With a cup full of yak, studio contact

Maniac with a contract

Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble

About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level

Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in

And take all my publishin', god damn

Just to rock the spectrum

Give up a right arm, just to do a form

No more, record company pimpin'

[verse two]

I'ma keep it simple, it went from ""please listen to my demo""

To ""get your ass out my limo""

Stretch presidential

It's essential cuz the record company will have your ass in a rental

If you let 'em, You have to behead 'em

Contracts you never read 'em

CEO's you never met 'em

Sent to an atourney, Burnstein and Burney

Nigga that's his lawyer, ain't got nothin' for ya

Treat ya like they emloy ya, i'm a warrior

Bite you in the ass like a Georgetown Hoya

When they ignore ya cause, you got to hold your balls

Catch a motherfucker slippin' in bathroom stalls

And then you show 'em that you ain't a rookie

Let 'em know that you'd rather have, more points than more pussy

Pimp turned bookie

Now how the fuck i get in so much debt

God damn, we just met

Welcome to the rap game

Motherfucker be confused and broke before he know whats happenin'

You can be the star and fuck women

I'ma just play the back and keep winnin'



No more (No more), record company pimpin'

Yo, we can go to war with the enemy

All we need is A.K.s and Hennessy

This ain't back in the days of Tennessee

Pull the trigger and release the energy [shots]

See muthafuckas run till they catch one

In the back, and it might cause a cardiac

Bitch act like he died and we brought him back

Him screamin for his mama and his sister pack

To all my thugs in the house, get your loc on

We can really give a fuck about a broke home

All we care about is bitches we can poke on

Nigga, what's that bullshit that you spoke on?

Better roll on 'fore we split your whole dome

Cause you're fuckin with Ice Cube the Terrible

Fuck around, I make your life unbearable

Make you live all scary and careful

Come through my neighborhood, you better tip-toe

Cause if you loud, then you might get chased down

To all my niggas with the lleyo

They rock it up like Play-Doh

Better do what I say so

Better lay low, cause you fuckin with a halo

Death to the niggas with the big mouth

And death to you devils from the Old South

And death to you hoes turnin tricks out

And death everyone that go the bitch route

Check it

If you infected by this record

Bow down butt-naked

And pray to God

Ice Cube won't spare the rod

[Ice Cube]

It's pourin rain, thunder and lightning

Clash of the titans, I'm home writin

Gangsta rap has arrived, I'm the only man alive

October 31st, 1985

Hard times, just got harder

Adolescent Ice Cube, the shit starter

A martyr, thanks to the father

for bein this mean as sixteen raps, feel like the bitch scream

You learned about your triple beam from me

You stopped payin for pussy and hit that ass for free

A little G never thought, that I could change the world

witta attitude, a Raider jacket and a jheri curl

Got every girl wantin to do me, screw me

Boyz N The Hood, the first rap, the first movie

Oooh wee *woman screaming* it's alive

So whatchu gon' do 24-7, 3-65

Dr. Frankenstein

Dr. Frankenstein



[Mr. Short Khop - x2]

Ooooh wee, it's alive

You better run and hide

Cover your ears and your eyes



[Ice Cube]

The world had to bow to this new style

Dial 9-1-1, makin more money than the law allow

But Fuck Tha Police, they can get deez

Now who was sayin shit like that before me?

No-body, but everybody wanna take the star's place

and be Scarface in the car chase

Illigitimate, counterfeit

Even got white boys talkin shit off the shit I invent

No no, motherfuckers musta took a photo

Tryin to call my gangsta shit 'mafioso'

but who ya usin? Fool it ain't no solution

to the evolution, of pimps and prostitution

I cuss, skanlous, I give a rush

to niggas who mind turn to mush, smokin on brush

Hush, I'm just a lush for this Hen

Chrome electroids, connected to my pen

When, blowin motherfuckers ain't knowin what we goin through

Spiritually, lyrically showin you

They call me, 'AmeriKKKa's Most Hated'

Gettin liberated by this monster I created

Dr. Frankenstein



[Mr. Short Khop]

We love to bump you Frankenstein

Yo' shit is the best

Take my body and my mind

Don't fuck with the stress

Hit me with that game to win

If you want, hit me again

We love you Frankenstein

We love you Frankenstein



[Ice Cube]

Now how many times did a nigga have to warn ya?

Ya fuckin up the formula (call the coroner)

It's outta hand, cos sucker ass niggas like you

try to pay the rent off my blueprint

New cent to the industry

You thought my shit was biodegradable, uh uh, it's unfadeable

Unstoppable, runnin through your suburbs

Incredible thug words

We gets down, nigga do the Monster Mash

and watch a nigga like me collect monster cash

Cos I'm sittin wit this bitch who got monster ass

Keep em wonderin how long the Don will last

And never pass, and when I want it buttered on toast

Can't no nigga see Ice Cube on no coast

So all you gotta do is focus

and see that I'm the fuckin loccest with this hocus pocus

Dr. Frankenstein

Dr. Frankenstein, ugh

one on the peddles the other on the handle bars (what)

tryin' be ghetto stars they said:

Are you from the westside is it so?

i said hell yea and who wanta to know (me)

in slow mo fo' fo' slugs face down in the mud

puddle full of blood left for dead

the pain starts to spread now I can't feel my legs

I meet doctor who at King Drew medical center

as I enter I.C.U.

he said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital

I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to

now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again

I sit there motionless holdin' this pain inside contemplating suicide

at night I jerk and jerk

I'm sitting on a doorway duece five

Dependin on that to keep my ass alive

My fuckin legs, lookin like tooth picks

some times I can't deal got to beg the B G's to roll me up the hill

put me on the porch now I'm on the torch smokin' cocaine

just to maintain nutin' to gain nutin' to lose

and last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom

feelin' like a two year old you can't get a sip from the brew I hold

[Intro - Sleep]
Hey wassup Cube?
Man I'm glad I caught you at your momma' house homey
Wassup man? You still got your pager right or you lost it?

(It's the curse, the curse....the curse, the curse)

Y'know my code right? I been pagin you for about a week man

(The curse, the curse) I heard about the deal ya got

Greed, Khop (The curse, the curse)

Check this out, you owe a nigga somethin man



[Ice Cube]

Do the math baby, do the math (Ch-ching)

Do the math baby, do the math (Ch-ching)

Do the math baby (The curse, the curse)

Do the math baby (The curse, the curse)



It's the curse of money, once you get it, fool you got it

Buy a new pair of drawers and motherfuckers spot it

Niggas plotted, to have me knotted up in basements

till these cocksuckers see what they're faced with

Their fantasies of a life stress-free

Full of orgies, in the Florida Keys

But this bullshit is so thick, it's like mountains

Sick of threatenin all my lawyers and accountants

The decibals, gold diggers goin for the testicles

Soon they realise, I don't invest in hoes

Sometimes it's like hell on earth

When everybody tryin to get your ass for all your worth

It's the curse



(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby

(The curse, the curse) Do the math



When you hot, they think you got more than you got

When you not, motherfuckers callin you a flop

I just laugh, the curse everybody wanna have

Before you sell your soul better do the math



I start to scream shit like ""May day, may day""

Cos motherfuckers think it's all grav-ay wit my pay day

And like I said, it's the curse of money

They start laughin at your jokes when they ain't that funny (Ha ha ha)

See this ass kissin yes man

Shakin hands with the left hand, get my weap-an, get to stepp-an

Fuck every phony ass nigga round me

Stick a shaft up your ass like Richie Roundtree (Yea yea!)

Got to have some gas money if you goin

If not who you fuckin? Who you flowin? Who you owin?

In '98 don't shit come free

Not even hard rhymes that's describin these hard times



(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby, do it

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby, aha

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby

(The curse, the curse) Do the math, ooh wee



When you hot, they think you got more than you got

When you not, motherfuckers callin you a flop

I just laugh (haha), the curse everybody wanna have

Before you sell your soul better do the math



[Mack 10]

To relax I smoke a stick, the shit make me sick

Gotta gang of new homies, and relatives on my dick

No time for drama, busters get sprayed

Bitches wanna get layed, and everybody need their bills paid (Everybody)

Motherfuckers, sweat me like a spy

They wanna kick it cos I, got the curse of mulah

Make me wanna start scrappin and look at me to make it happen

What the fuck was they doin before Mack 10 was rappin ?!? Tell me

(What the fuck?) how can I remain a man of seven figures

when I'm rushed by gold diggers everytime I get bigger? (Ch-ching)

Like David Banner, when I tweak I turn green

And everytime I'm seen it's like people start to fiend

It's the curse



[Ice Cube]

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby (aha)

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby (1 million, 2 million)

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby (3 million)

(The curse, the curse) Do the math



When you hot, they think you got more than you got

Yeah they do

When you not, motherfuckers callin you a flop (Motherfuckers)

I just laugh, the curse everybody wanna have

Before you sell your soul better do the math (Better do it)



(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby

Get the fuck outta here

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby

With dollar signs in your eyes

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby (Ha ha, sheeit)

(The curse, the curse) Do the math



[Outro - Ice Cube]

Leave your ass broke

Rabbit ears, nigga for pockets, haha he

I'm cursed! Hahaha, but I love it"

order must be maintained.
Without a strict and unforgiving chain of command,
chaos is inevitable.""



[Ice Cube]

Whassup youngsta?

Since you the new booty, and don't know nothin,

I got to show you bout the peckin order

It's the order in how we do things and move things

See, somebody gon' tell you what to do

after I tell that motherfucker what to do



It's the peckin order [echo]

It's the peckin order [echo]



We got the power to make you niggaz sour

Big fish whale like Ichikowa, steppin out the shower

It's the peckin order, ask ya daugther how we peck

Inspect, high class ass to projects

Push my Lex through the California rain, gutter lane

Infamous schemes on the brain

for my connect gang, put a strain on every link

in our chain, that's right - we all get arraigned

Takin sworn notes to makin c-notes

Knowin all the while that bullshit floats and niggaz don't

So nigga don't - gangsta paradise ain't nuttin nice

Yeah we livin so trife we need Je-sus in our life



[Chorus: Ice Cube, Mack 10]



[Cube]

It's the peckin order

[Mack]

It's the order how we do things

and move things, only fuck with the true things



[Ice Cube]

Havin heavy intercourse with the world of depression

Messin with the wrong bitches never learn our lesson

Stressin, no guessin, never question

Even when we playin, we testin, confession

Do you still wanna meet where the killers eat?

Held accountable for anythang you repeat

It's the peckin order, ask your daughter how we peck

When we smoke you, it's your best friend you suspect



[Chorus]



[Mack 10]

Now c'mon, come on potnah, c'mon (it's the peckin order)

Fuck that, I don't wanna hear none of that shit man

All that cryin and beggin and shit

To be honest wit you that shit really don't even

affect me in no kind of way potnah

You wastin your muthafuckin time (it's the peckin order)

Let's get this shit goin, let's get it over with

C'mon back here, back here

I can't make no motherfuckin mess right here

Check this out homie, make it easy on yourself

I know you want a motherfuckin open casket

where your peoples can see you and kiss on you

but you gon' piss me off

and I'ma blow noodles out your motherfuckin head

and ain't none of that happenin after that

So, c'mon back here, c'mon, right - c'mon, ay

But you know, one more thing before I do this [BLAM!!]

Here we go with mo' drama in the projects



Wait a minute, who is this motherfucker?



You better take his ass in the back, and start talkin

Nick that bud 'fore it bloom, and start stalkin

I can hear you guys yellin [glass breaks] a little strugglin

Youse a FOOL if you think that I'm jumpin in

That nigga jet, smokin on a ciggarette

You say domestic shit, get you soakin wet?

Well come widdit and get it, blow my socks

while I'm drinkin all the Kool-Aid, watchin Jamie Foxx

I'm hearin mo' knocks [knock knock knock]

They came all the way to the projects to meet you) Who?

This fool wearin black, his girl, in the see through

Distraction, a little action, [fight ensues] I woke up

Tied up like (What happened? Punk you shoulda stuck to rappin

Where the platinum at motherfucker?

I hear that shit worth more than gold!)

I'm like baffled, they got me gaffled, with the duct tape

So I remain raw, in come this chainsaw [knock knock knock]

Another knock, it's the girl from two-ten

here to drop salt, that's when them bitches fought

I thought, ""I bet-ta plan my escape""

In the midst of this commotion, Ice Cube is breakin tape

I'm free, bombin on the first thing I see

And guess who walk in, with a nine, and a grin

It's the baby daddy he ain't playin, [gunshots]

He started layin everybody down, about face with a frown

I'm runnin to the bedroom, I lock the do'

and grab the phone, the bitch phone ain't turned on

I think I'm gone, that's when I hear a soft knock

It's the girl from two-ten, with her number, and a glock

Said, ""Call me up, if it's for sex, or chin check

Nigga get you a real ass bitch from the projects!""

[Verse 1]

When I was with you all you ever do was bitch

Talk shit, but you could suck dick

So I didn't sweat all the fussin' and cussin'

On New Year's Eve, the night I was bussin'(wow)

I would stress and strain to mantain

And didn't need to hear your motherfucking ass complain

About niggaz in the house (mm), feet on the couch

Talkin' all loud (yeah), blunt in my mouth (yeah)

Bitch I got fifty cents on this genesis

Talkin' 'bout niggaz got to vacate the premises

(She's dead) Homie histor

An' outa nowhere your ass got hard

Poured out the pub, then you got drugged

We at it again, I tried to count to ten

There's no end to your naggin'

You can't treat me like I'm faggin', hoe

You see I'm saggin' (no)

Why I gotta act like a motherfucking asshole (why)

To be king of my motherfucking castle

You'll never be the missus (never)

Breakin' all my dishes

And fuck all my X-bitches

Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you

The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours

[Verse 2]

On an' off, off an' on, bitch I'm grown

So stop playing on my phone (stop)

It was a time we used to bump and grind

And find heaven (ahh)

Without a motherfucking reverend

Managoua twages and bomb-ass massages

And dreams of three-car garages

You say I'm cheating when I'm up at the studio

Come to find out you the hoe, oh

And you was way out

Talkin' 'bout rap, was gonna play ya

And I was wasting my time writing rhyme (hahaha)

You made yourself loud and clear

You wanted me to choose between you and my career (bitch)

Started fucking with this baller named Chris

Couldn't resist the Rolex on his wrist

I kept on writing my raps with profanity

Now I'm on tour fucking bitches like Fanady

You tried to diss this, now you missed this

And the first and fifteenth is like Christmas

Send me naked pictures but give it a rest

With Mrs Ice Cube tatood on your breast

Now you at the back door of my show

Dressed like a hoe, axin' could you blow (no),

Hell no but it's still delicious

Went from rags to riches

And fuck all my X-bitches



[Chorus 2]

Fuck you, fuck you, especially you

The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours

[repeat]



Now I hear you sayin' ""Yeah I used to fuck 'em""

Not lettin' 'em know I was a young buck then

Niggaz axin' me ""Man, did you love her?""

Loved her stupid ass enough to fuck her with a rubber (bitch)

Now I hear, I'm your big brother (who?)

Second cousin, friend

Bitch since when?

Incest ain't the way I swing (nah)

Never bought your ass a goddamn thing

That I had to pay for

I was hateful

Ungrateful (uh) and never faithful

Fuckin' everything that I could get my paws on

Walkin' through hell with gasoline draws on

Now I'm on the mic, music is my life

Kids and a wife, heard you was a dite (damn)

It's your thing if you like the switches

But it's my world and fuck all my X-bitches

I don't want that shit no more

Got to get the fuck out of here (yeah right)

This bitch dimmed the lights (nigga, spend the night)

Count my pennies, only got a bag fulla twenties

Listen, these feds fishin for this extradition

I'm on a mission, fuck em, fight em, dine em, ditch em

I gotta kick rocks, can't pick locks

Or spend the rest of my life in a shit-?bath

It's so hard to get a room without a credit card

It's so hard not to let em know where you are

Tried to get a rent a car

But he laughed when I showed him cash

Had to mash 'fore he called the feds on my ass

Went to Vegas for the weekend

Met a hoe down freakin

Hey bitch, why you sneakin?

Grabbed the paper out her hand

Am I the man on the front page? (Fuck)

Same height, same age (click-click)

Rap gauge, put it down the G-way

Got my hostage suckin sausage on the freeway

She say ""Let's hear the circle K""

Ran inside and made the niggaz all pay

It's like I hit the Lotto outside Colorado

Brought it there for his wallet and my bottle

That's my motto and I gotta warn ya

before I'm through, I'm going back to California

[Verse 3]

My boys Utah to Illinois

Set the poise, so I can infiltrate

All fifty states

Can't wait till I'm back on my feet

Switch and shake this bitch in her sleep

Low key you feds can't see me

I'm up in D.C. with strike number three

Clownin, made a little stock to get a little cock

Now I got niggaz bangin and lootin rock

I'm going back to Cali where it's bound with my strikes

Don't give a fuck who's on the ?marin or the mic

I should've known when I seen that motherfucker in the lobby

looking like he wanna rob me (Fuck)

Federal, don't like no black hetero, sexual, intellectual

Tried to turn me into a vegetable

An I'm 'a sue all black and blue

When I come to- hand cuff (Fuck y'all)

Cos they can't stand us

They get excited and I try to fight it (mama)

I'm going back to Cali to show, extradited

Hey mama, when y'all send pictures you can't send a polaroid

Got to be the regular pictures

On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin

Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin

In any country, prison is where society sends it's failures
But in this country, society itself is failing.
[Verse One:]



Today, how you like me now, I'm in the mix?

It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota

Got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal

Dropped out the twelveth

Cuz my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees

Now I slang keys

Infest my hood with crack, cuz I'm the mack

Take a nation of millions to hold me back

Too big for my britches, and I got bitches

Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches

Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5

'89s the number, another summer

Police ain't get no dumber

Streets dried up, used to think it would last

But being a king-pin is a thing of the past

They tried to blast me for selling a boulder

Now I got my ass in Minnesota

Got my own crew, it's on brand new



Damn, what can I do?



Today...



[Verse Two:]



Already done stack me half a mill ticket

Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it

Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz

Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome

Police are tappin' my mobile phone

I'm almost home

Gettin' excited, indited, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it

Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest

And everything I own got repossessed

Now take a look at the dust

And I'm happy cuz I only got 36 months

Never picked up a book

But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look

Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew

And see, what can I do?



Today...



[Verse Three:]



Phucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo

Back in LA, and I'm bailin' in the dough

Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch

So where to work at, and niggas smirk at

Me say ain't nuttin' poppin from here to the LB

What you tell me?

No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe

Cuz, they sent in the troops

Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle

Takin' niggas sh*t in a tussle

No skills to pay the bills

Takin' 'bout education to battle inflashion

No college degree, just a dumb ass G

(Yeah you Nigga, who me?)

I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess

Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes

Took some advice from my Uncle Fester

All dressed up in polyester

Welcome to McDonalds may I please help you?

sh*t, what can I do?



Today...



[Outro:]

up there lookin like Superchicken

At night I see your light through my bedroom window

But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil

I can't wait till I hear you say

""I'm going down, mayday, mayday."" I'm gonna clown

Cause everytime that the pigs have got me

y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi

Standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher

""So fly like an eagle.""

But don't follow us wherever we go

""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird"" [2x]

Now..

My homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex

And let me try the four next

Now the four I was driving was hotter than july

looked up and didn't see it whippin' in the sky

Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom

""Calling all cars, I think we've got em.""

I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood

I think I drove through every single hood

South Central, Compton and Watts

Long Beach, bust a U, here come the cops

Wish I had a genie with about three wishes

Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious

You know that I'm running

Shit, I hear it humming

Fuck, I see it coming

Is it a bird? Yup

Is it a plane? No

I hit me a right on El Segundo

Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala

Let's see if they would folla

Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another

met me a baby pitbull and his mother

Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window

I wish it was my ten-four

had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third

cuz I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird



""Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back

on. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115

miles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be

real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh...

Ehrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.""

Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him

could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?

See, I didn't want to gank you

but don't make me bank you, thank you

Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess

that a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus

Incognito, Ghetto Eagle

Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?""

I bust me a left from Rubellon. Park

The 735 and I'm bailin

Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man,

She helped me run like Harriet Tubman

Looked out the window by the black bed

I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed

Then the light from the bird hit me in the face

I close the blinds cause I didn't wanna catch a case

All that night, I heard the bird circle

while I was eating fish and watching Urkel

She said I could sleep on the couch

By two A.M. I was digging her out

Fuck the ghetto bird



""Which way is he going now?""

""Ok, now..now he's..he's actually southbound..on a service street..

and, uh...Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure

out which service srteet he suddelny turned off on. Uh, the sherriffs

In any country, prison is where society sends it's failures
But in this country, society itself is failing.
[Verse One:]



Today, how you like me now, I'm in the mix?

It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota

Got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal

Dropped out the twelveth

Cuz my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees

Now I slang keys

Infest my hood with crack, cuz I'm the mack

Take a nation of millions to hold me back

Too big for my britches, and I got bitches

Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches

Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5

'89s the number, another summer

Police ain't get no dumber

Streets dried up, used to think it would last

But being a king-pin is a thing of the past

They tried to blast me for selling a boulder

Now I got my ass in Minnesota

Got my own crew, it's on brand new



Damn, what can I do?



Today...



[Verse Two:]



Already done stack me half a mill ticket

Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it

Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz

Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome

Police are tappin' my mobile phone

I'm almost home

Gettin' excited, indited, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it

Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest

And everything I own got repossessed

Now take a look at the dust

And I'm happy cuz I only got 36 months

Never picked up a book

But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look

Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew

And see, what can I do?



Today...



[Verse Three:]



Phucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo

Back in LA, and I'm bailin' in the dough

Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch

So where to work at, and niggas smirk at

Me say ain't nuttin' poppin from here to the LB

What you tell me?

No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe

Cuz, they sent in the troops

Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle

Takin' niggas sh*t in a tussle

No skills to pay the bills

Takin' 'bout education to battle inflashion

No college degree, just a dumb ass G

(Yeah you Nigga, who me?)

I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess

Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes

Took some advice from my Uncle Fester

All dressed up in polyester

Welcome to McDonalds may I please help you?

sh*t, what can I do?



Today...

He's quick to hit you up with the two fingers spreaded (Wassup?)
Don't roll that shit (Wassup?) and hold that shit (Wassup?)

Now you know what fuckin set he's claimin

A wild little nigga and it ain't no tamin

And just when you think everything is calm

that motherfucker is the first to bum

like bang, ping, catch you with the sleeper

He'll draw down and then check his beeper

He's clockin them chicks and bucks

Gettin, his little dick sucked by the, clucks

And will he do dirt? Fool oh please

Little locs are harder then the OGz

You fall to the ground and beg please

Just got served by little niggas on the 10-speed

12 years old, got bumps they can't keep

A straight killer, a fool, a lil ass gee.....



God damn, it's a trick

Use to have the G.I.Joe with the kung-fu grip

Now he's straight Crip, or Blood

Now ya sag, you use the blunt

Now ya known as the favorite groupie

Goin to camp and it ain't Camp Snoopy (Wassup?)

But I ain't surprised

It's 12 months later, year, I see you got a little size

You motherfuckin crook

You want respect cos you didn't get'cha manhood took

Drinkin that 'yac like it's no tomorr-y

Westside hustler fucker-tory

In the jail and it ain't no thang

Can't wait til you get 22's on the hang (Uhh)

A underage boy that's lookin tossed

And that's ya idea of who you hide

All you want for Christmas is guns and drinkers

Little nigga nuttier than a Snicker

You don't wanna be like Mike, you wanna be like me

A fool, a killer, a lil ass gee......



[Interlude: (two sampled guys talking)]



See, I knew it wouldn't be long

They got your ass stretched like Stretch Armstrong

In the one-man cell, it got'cha thinkin

Sendin more kites than Benjamin Franklin

20 years old but ya still a veteran

Won't touch down til we're livin like the Jetsons

Proud of ya self, because ya done done it

Gotcha 22's and your name on your stomach

Never even think about a woman to fuck

Rather stand in lin eor bust the ass of a young buck

Got stuck, now you're bleedin

Hospital ward, is got your reading

Learn about the knowledge of self ya see

that ya mad enough to go and stick the death to these

See, it ain't about bein hard

But that's whatcha tell the little homies in the yard

Ya already done did 10

Damn.
I'm broke.
My feet hurt.
(Inside the mind of a car jacker)

And that bitch is slippin.

It makes me wanna..creep.

It makes me wanna..creep.



[Verse One]



Damn, I'm such a G it's pathetic

Here comes the big-headed

Nigga that's dippin

Sippin on Courvoisier

Goddamn I must havta floss today

Now pimpin aint easy but it's necessary

So I'm chasin bitches like Tom chased Jerry

I'll put the pedal to the flo-uh

In my two-tone Ford Explo-uh

You know how it's done

Sounds bumpin

Ain't that sumthin?

Jumped on the 110

She's flyin in the Blazer

Like ""Go Speed Racer""

But I ain't gonna chase her

Like Racer X

But I won't flex

Til it's time to have sex

So when you wanna get togetha?

Cause you know a nigga like me

Is down for whatever



And I'm down for whatever



[Verse Two]



When I was little I didn't wanna be like Mike

I wanted to be like Ike

Cause

Papa Was A Rolling Stone in the sixties

And he liked green like Bill Bixby

Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty

Pokets never skinny

Played let's get it on in the living room

Cause he'll turn the party out sayin, ""This is MY muthafuckin house""

And y'all gots to go

Through the door

And if you can't find the door

He'll help you with the four-four

Talkin much shit on the grass

And straight down to blast

I'm still in my p.j.'s

He's in a turtleneck sweater

And we down for whatever



And I'm down

Solid Pro is down for whatever

The Don Jaguar is down for whatever

And it don't seem to stop



[Verse Three]



Now

I don't talk a lot of shit

But when it's time to get busy with these hos, let's go

Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead

Then my niggas wearin blue or red

Cause I got the gift

To hit these hos swift

And I'm smellin like a fifth

Of sumthin

Yeah, that's right

I'm standin in the store

Koreans

Act so nice

Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells

Donut

And you know what?

I'm Cool Like Dat like Digable Planets

But don't take a nigga for granted

Cause whether it's a verdict of the L.A. four

You just don't know

That this rappin-ass nigga will change with the weather

And be down for whatever

And I'm down

Creep.

And I'm down for whatever



Ice Cube - devoid of pop

And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas

It makes me wanna..creep."

Listen to the preacherman
But are you talkin' to me
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
If I should need the swine flesh

Your body is a mess, but you're blessed

With a father, son, spirit and the holy ghost

But my whole neigborhood is comatose

Lookin' for survival

The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible

400 years gettin' our ass kicked

By so-called christians and catholics

But I watch 'em burn in a fire

See I'm a g, that's why I ain't in your choir

Cause I see, cause I know

The church ain't nothin' but a fashion show

Get the devil to a 187

And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven



[Verse Two:]



You're waitin' for the devil to come from the ground

Clown, take a look around

Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'

A beast in sheep's clothing

But I'm rollin' with that knowledge of self

Cause heaven ain't just wealth

So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe

Do I have to wait outside?

White man, please take another look

Cause we couldn't be readin' out of the same book

Cause youse a crook and I'm a brother

King James had sex with his mother

Is that your edition? Is that your religion?

Black man, you gotta make a desicion

Cause God is comin' on day number seven

And he won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven



[Verse Three:]



The same white man that threw me in the slammer

He bombed the church in Alabama

So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind

If I have to kill the human swine

Cause God is a killer from the start

Why you think Noah had to build his ark

And God is a man from his feet to his hair

That's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer

I just stare at the church man

Spendin' more money on the church band

But Elijah's got a plan

Got the white man screamin': 'Damn that Farrakhan!'

Cause one day these babies are uprise

Much more than bowties and bean pies

Kickin' knowledge at 7-11

And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven"

[Ice Cube]

Darryl Gates got the studio surrounded

Cause he don't like the niggaz that I'm down with

Motherfucker wanna do us

Cause I like Nat, Huey, Malcolm, and Louis

Most got done by a black man's bullet

Give a trigger to a nigga and watch him pull it

Negro assass-in

I'ma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw yo' ass in

When they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker

They use somebody much blacker

What I do? I called up the Geto Boy(s) crew

Cause +My Mind's Playing Tricks On Me+ too

Never died, surround my crib

and F.O.I. makin sure nobody creep when I sleep

Keep a 9 millimeter in my Jeep - PEEP!

When I roll, I gots to roll deep

Ain't goin out cheap

Met the MADD Circle on Cypress Hill cause it's so steep

They'll never get me, they'll never hit me

Motherfuck that shit J-Dee

Now I'm relaxed

Grab the St. Ide's brew so I can max

Sittin by the window cause it's so fuckin hot

and then I heard a shot - boom."

One, two, three and I come with the wicked
style and you know that I'm from the wicked

crew, act like you knew

cos I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo

Pick it, wicked rhymes, picket signs

While me and the mob gotta truck full of 9's]

Play ya and I'll slay ya

I got thug-made dough by the hey-a

Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and it's a must

to DUCK DUCK DUCK before I bust

Lookin for the one that did it

but like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it

Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills

and I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills

Sittin at the pad just chillin

cos Larry Parker just got two million, oh what a feelin

So shake that nigga and pass me the pill

and I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal

Like it, dig it, maybe and watch that ???

Kick it cos I get wicked



[Chorus: (some toaster, once again won't translate to avoid offending)]



[Verse 2:]



Won't say nuttin, just listen

Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison

Come my way and get served

Still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb

Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin

Never seen with a happy grin

Show the fat foul cos I'm down

Take a look around

and all you see is big black boots steppin

Use my steel toe as a weapon

Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to

label this nigga, tape with the sticker

Kickin out girls that's nicety

Yo, I gotta body count like Ice-T

From here to New York

I get skins and ain't talkin bout pork

Swine, pig, dick

Listen to the flow of a so-called negro

who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett

Dig it cos I get wicked



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]



People wanna know how come

I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm

Ready to bring that noise

Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys

April 29th was power to the people

and we might just see a sequel

cos police got equal pay

A horse is a pig that don't fly straight

Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams

down with the pilgrims

Just a super slave

We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave

I'm wicked enough to board this

Cos now it's on to the fullest

Gorilla straight from the mist

But I don't miss when it comes to this

Bring the yellow tape

The white cape, cos I'm so straight

Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it

Bigot, cos I get wicked"

Fightin' with the beast, no justice, no peace

Niggaz are sick of your white man tricks with no treat

You call me a Muslim, no, I'm not a resident

Still got my vote in, Farrakhan for president

There's somethin' out there waitin' for us

Got my black rag showin' and I'm hoin', Ira Reiner

Can kiss my grits like Flo, on Mel's Diner

I'm meaner than a motherfuckin' hyena chasin' antelope

Put my chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a cantaloupe

I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em

Talk about dogs, boy I can slang 'em

Rat-a-tat-tat on your noggin'

'Cause Ice'll cream your ass like Haagen-Dasz Chocolate, 

I get crazy when I catch wreck

Even be flippin' the tongue like da-diggity-dung, Das-EFX

So who is Ice Cube? I'm a rapper, actor, macker

Got a little problem with the redneck cracker, did the tallywacker, Jerry Heller, is a devil shit packer

Comin' with a crazy pitch

And the Statue of Liberty ain't nothin' but a lazy bitch

Don't wanna give up the crack, to the black

But you'll call it racial, if we go and rape the ho

But eat 'em up yum and you're floored

Motherfuck Billboard and the editor, I am The Predator

Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back

I look at the miniskirt, now I'm askin her

Would you like to hit the fat bud,

or perhaps should I run your name through the mud

I mean, are you giving up the nappy dugout?

She said no, well then get the fuck out

Cause I know where the hoes be feinin'

plus your fat ass got my six-deuce leanin'

Bust a U on the avenue

why oh why there ain't shit to do

But then sir jinx played his mix

and you thought that shit played out in eighty six

Lookin for my dogs

looked up in the mirror being followed by the hogs

One time's on my motherfuckin line

why the fuck the swine had to get behind a nigga like me

They must thind I'm a gee

they both walk up with the g. l. o. c.

get out of the car with your hands up and legs spread.)

Started they investigation

He said don't lie to me

I'm lookin for John, Matt, or Spike Lee

The motherfucker called for back up

I guess they planned to beat the mack up

He called me a silly ass thug

and pulled out his billy ass club

Tearin up my coupe lookin for the chronic

goddamn nobody got a panasonic

Found an empty can of old gold

came around and put my ass in a choke hold

Fucked around and broke my pager

then they hit a nigga with the tazer

the motherfucking pigs were tryin to hurt me

I fell to the floor and yelled lord have mercy

Then they hit me in the face ya'll

but to them it ain't nuttin but (a friendly game of base ball)

Crowd stood around I said goddamn ya

Who got the camera

I knew when I saw that deputy smirkin'

that they were gonna put some work in

Mr. law had to hit me in the jaw

cause I called them faggots with guns and badges

They played rat-a-tat-tat on me head

but if I had the gatty-gat-gat they'd be dead

A victim of a big fat 187

and little devils don't go to heaven

Last night there were eleven but they were'nt scarin me

so they tried the flashlight therapy

I looked at the black one and called him a traitor

I don't give a fuck if you got a beta

Just take my fuckin picture

so I can go downtown and bitch and pitch ya (?)

The one that called me a spook

his name is officer David Duke

If the crowd weren't around they would've shot me

tried to play me out like my name was rodney

Fuckin police gettin badder

Ice Cube is out-gunned, what is the outcome?

Will they do me like Malcolm?

Cause I bust styles, new styles, standin - strong!

While, others +Run+ a +Hundred Miles+

But I never run, never will

Deal with the devil with my motherfuckin steel - BOOM!

Media try to do me

But I was a Boy-N-the-Hood before the movie, yeah

Call me nigga, bigger than a spook

But you the one that voted for Duke, motherfucker

White man, is somethin I tried to study

But I got my hands bloody, yeah

They said I could sing like a Jaybird

But nigga, don't say the J-word

I thought they was buggin

cause to us Uncle Sam, is Hitler without an oven

Burnin our black skin

Buy my neighborhood - then push the crack in

Doin us wrong from the first day

And don't understand why a nigga got an AK

Callin me an African-American

like everything is fair again, shit

Devil, you got to get the shit right I'm black

Blacker than a trillion midnights

+Don't Believe the Hype+ was said in '88

by the great Chuck D, now they're tryin to fuck me

"".. with +No Vaseline+

Just a match and a little bit of gasoline.."" - HUH!

It's a great day for genocide (What's that?)

That's the day all the niggaz died

They killed JFK in '63

So what the fuck you think they'll do to me?

But I'm the O.G. and I bust back (boom boom)

Bust back (Boom boom!) peel a cap (BOOM BOOM!)

Gimme room in the fire of the sun

Here the mack come, here the black come, watch Jack run!

Motherfuckers can't gank me

Fuck a devil, fuck a rebel, and a yankee

Overrun and put the Presidency

After needin that, I'm down wit O.P.P., yeah

I met Farrakhan and had dinner

And you ask if I'm a five-percenter, well...

No, but I go where the brothers go

Down with Compton Mosque, Number 54

Made a little dough, still got a sister on my elbow

Did Ice Cube sell out? You say, ""Hell no!""

A black woman is my manager, not in the kitchen

So could you please stop bitchin?

""Guerillas in the Mist.."" without Jungle Fever

But I got the fever for the flava of a cracker

Not a Pringle, bust the single, here's my new jingle

""Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots""

The KKK has got three-piece suits

Using niggaz like turkey shoots

My motto is +Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute+

Now if I say no violence, devil, you won't respect mine

Fuck the dumb shit - and get my Tec-9

And if they approach us

A-ight, a-ight - I bury those cockroaches

And if you can't deal with my +Kill at Will+

Here's a new gift to get - try my +Death Certificate+

+Amerikkka's Most+, Amerikkka's burnt - it's like toast

Like Jordan, I'm goin coast to coast

Dribblin the funk here comes the nigga

""Jordan.. watch Jordan,

[Ice Cube]

Darryl Gates got the studio surrounded

Cause he don't like the niggaz that I'm down with

Motherfucker wanna do us

Cause I like Nat, Huey, Malcolm, and Louis

Most got done by a black man's bullet

Give a trigger to a nigga and watch him pull it

Negro assass-in

I'ma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw yo' ass in

When they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker

They use somebody much blacker

What I do? I called up the Geto Boy(s) crew

Cause +My Mind's Playing Tricks On Me+ too

Never died, surround my crib

and F.O.I. makin sure nobody creep when I sleep

Keep a 9 millimeter in my Jeep - PEEP!

When I roll, I gots to roll deep

Ain't goin out cheap

Met the MADD Circle on Cypress Hill cause it's so steep

They'll never get me, they'll never hit me

Motherfuck that shit J-Dee

Now I'm relaxed

Grab the St. Ide's brew so I can max

Sittin by the window cause it's so fuckin hot

and then I heard a shot - boom."

One, two, three and I come with the wicked

cos I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo

Pick it, wicked rhymes, picket signs

While me and the mob gotta truck full of 9's]

Play ya and I'll slay ya

I got thug-made dough by the hey-a

Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and it's a must

to DUCK DUCK DUCK before I bust

Lookin for the one that did it

but like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it

Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills

and I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills

Sittin at the pad just chillin

cos Larry Parker just got two million, oh what a feelin

So shake that nigga and pass me the pill

and I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal

Like it, dig it, maybe and watch that ???

Kick it cos I get wicked



[Chorus: (some toaster, once again won't translate to avoid offending)]



[Verse 2:]



Won't say nuttin, just listen

Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison

Come my way and get served

Still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb

Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin

Never seen with a happy grin

Show the fat foul cos I'm down

Take a look around

and all you see is big black boots steppin

Use my steel toe as a weapon

Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to

label this nigga, tape with the sticker

Kickin out girls that's nicety

Yo, I gotta body count like Ice-T

From here to New York

I get skins and ain't talkin bout pork

Swine, pig, dick

Listen to the flow of a so-called negro

who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett

Dig it cos I get wicked



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]



People wanna know how come

I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm

Ready to bring that noise

Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys

April 29th was power to the people

and we might just see a sequel

cos police got equal pay

A horse is a pig that don't fly straight

Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams

down with the pilgrims

Just a super slave

We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave

I'm wicked enough to board this

Cos now it's on to the fullest

Gorilla straight from the mist

But I don't miss when it comes to this

Bring the yellow tape

The white cape, cos I'm so straight

Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it

Bigot, cos I get wicked"

Rollin' with the sawed-off gauge

Fightin' with the beast, no justice, no peace

Still got my vote in, Farrakhan for president

There's somethin' out there waitin' for us

Got my black rag showin' and I'm hoin', Ira Reiner

Can kiss my grits like Flo, on Mel's Diner

I'm meaner than a motherfuckin' hyena chasin' antelope

Put my chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a cantaloupe

I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em

Talk about dogs, boy I can slang 'em

Rat-a-tat-tat on your noggin'

'Cause Ice'll cream your ass like Haagen-Dasz Chocolate, 

I get crazy when I catch wreck

Even be flippin' the tongue like da-diggity-dung, Das-EFX

So who is Ice Cube? I'm a rapper, actor, macker

Got a little problem with the redneck cracker, did the tallywacker, Jerry Heller, is a devil shit packer

Comin' with a crazy pitch

And the Statue of Liberty ain't nothin' but a lazy bitch

Don't wanna give up the crack, to the black

But you'll call it racial, if we go and rape the ho

But eat 'em up yum and you're floored

Motherfuck Billboard and the editor, I am The Predator

Found an empty can of old gold

came around and put my ass in a choke hold

Fucked around and broke my pager

then they hit a nigga with the tazer

the motherfucking pigs were tryin to hurt me

I fell to the floor and yelled lord have mercy

Then they hit me in the face ya'll

but to them it ain't nuttin but (a friendly game of base ball)

Crowd stood around I said goddamn ya

Who got the camera



[Repeat Chorus]



[Verse 3]



I knew when I saw that deputy smirkin'

that they were gonna put some work in

Mr. law had to hit me in the jaw

cause I called them faggots with guns and badges

They played rat-a-tat-tat on me head

but if I had the gatty-gat-gat they'd be dead

A victim of a big fat 187

and little devils don't go to heaven

Last night there were eleven but they were'nt scarin me

so they tried the flashlight therapy

I looked at the black one and called him a traitor

I don't give a fuck if you got a beta

Just take my fuckin picture

so I can go downtown and bitch and pitch ya (?)

The one that called me a spook

his name is officer David Duke

If the crowd weren't around they would've shot me

tried to play me out like my name was rodney

Fuckin police gettin badder

but if I had a camera the shit wouldn't matter

(bitch), uh who got my nine, who got my nine

Ya'll done did it this time, uh

who the fuck got my nine"

This is the final boarding call for flight 1259
departing from Los Angeles, final destination to St. Louis
Thank you
[Ice Cube]

Damn G, the spot's gettin hot

So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?

Police looking at niggaz through a microscope

In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope

They trying to stop it

So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?

Catch a flight to St. Louis

That's cool, cause nobody knew us

We stepped off the plane

Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers

Rented a car at wholesale

Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel

Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty

Cause where we stayin, niggaz look shady

But they can't fade South Central

Cause bustin a cap is fundamental

Checkin out every block close

Seein which one will clock the most

Yeah this is the one no doubt

Bust a U Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out



Ay ay man, whassup nigga?

Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga!

[gun shots]



Now clearin em out meant casualties

Still had the L.A. mentality

Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry

Wouldn't you know, a driveby in Missouri

Them fools got popped

Took their corner next day, set up shop

And it's better than slangin in the Valley

Triple the profit makin more than I did in Cali

Breakin off rocks like Barney Rubble

Cause them mark-ass niggaz don't want trouble

And we ain't on edge when we do work

Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts

Getting bitches and they can't stand a

Nineteen-ninety-one Tony Montana

Now the shit's like a war

of gang violence, where it was never seen before

Punks whirl when the gat bust

Four jheri curl niggaz kickin up dust

And some of them are even lookin up to us

Wearing our colors and talkin that gang fuss

Giving up much love

Dyin for a street, that they ain't even heard of

But other motherfuckers want to stand strong

So you know the phrase, once again it's on



[TV announcer]

Top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central

Los Angeles which are known for their driveby shootings

have migrated into East St. Louis

leaving three dead and two others injured

No arrests have been made

Police say this is a nationwide trend

with similar incidents occuring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma

(female voice repeating in background:

""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere"")



[Ice Cube]

BOOM, my homie got shot he's a goner black

St. Louis niggaz want they corner back

Shooting in snowy weather

It's illegal business, niggaz still can't stick together

Fuckin police got the four-one-one

that L.A. ain't all, surf and sun

But we ain't thinkin, bout the boys

Feudin, like the Hatfields and McCoys

Now the shit's gettin tricky

Cause now they lookin for the colors and the khakis

Damn, the spot's gettin hot from the battle

About to pack up and start slangin in Seattle

But the NARCs, raid about six in the morning

Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin

Put his glock to my chest as I paused

Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers

Tryin to give me, fifty-seven years

Face'll be full of those tattooed tears

It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck

And the public defender ain't givin a fuck

The fool must be sparkin

Talkin about a double life plea bargain

You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G

Plus the Black Guerilla family

And the white pride don't like Northside

And it's a riot if any more niggaz die

No parole or probation

Now this is a young man's summer vacation

No chance for rehabilitation

Cause look at the motherfuckin years that I'm facin

I'ma end it like this cause you know what's up

My life is fucked"

And when dealin with the Lench Mob you gots to know

Steady Mobbin is not just the name of this jam, but a way of life

Bound together by motherfuckers that's known

to break em off somethin, give it to me



Four or five niggaz in a mothership

Better known as a goose and we all wanna smother shit

Bent, front and back glass got tint

Tryin to get our hands on some dollars and cents

And fools can't hold us

Every chance we get, we hittin up the rollers

Comin up short of the green guys

And I might start slangin bean pies

Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month

With ""U Can't Touch This"" on the front

I'm bout to get rich

Cause life ain't nuttin but money and fuck a bitch

They drop like dominoes

And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes

So after the screwin

I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings

I'm out the do'

All you might get is a rubber on the floor

Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti

Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin



Bustin caps in the mix

Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six

Cause I'm gettin major

Fuck Pac Tel, move to Sky Pager

Told all my friends

Don't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's is givin ends

Fools get drunk and wanna compete

Slapboxin in the street

Niggaz get mad, tempers are flarin

cause they got a few bitches starin

Just for the nappy heads

But scandalous bitches, make for happy Feds

I'm making my duty to cuss em

out, cause I just don't trust em

And if you tell on me I'm bombin on Betty

Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin



Since one-time so hot

Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the glock

And I'm rollin on rims

Eating soul food, and neckbones from M&M's

Grumblin like a motherfucker

Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit

Saw Sir Jinx bailin'

When I hit a left, I moved felon, 'Whattup loc?'

Don't you know that niggaz get smoked

That take they life for a joke, get in nigga

I take you to the pad zoom

Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom

Jumped back in my low rider

Comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter

Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat

Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at

Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps

But hoes lickin us like stamps

One fool brought the music for the yams

But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch

Cause I had the jam on

And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon

Give me the nappy and make me happy

The hoe said 'Pappy could you slap me

on the ass hard and fast

and could please try not to leave a gash?'

I said yeah, but I don't play sex

When I'm putting on the latex

Slipped on the condom

Fucked around and dropped the bomb son

And it came out sort of like confetti

In for the night, no longer steady mobbin"

I brought my daughter up man,

in a Catholic school, private school

Man what you want with her?

I'm sick of this bullshit!

Yo man, let me tell you somethin..



[Verse One]

Your daughter was a nice girl, now she is a slut

A queen treatin niggaz just like King Tut

Gobblin up nuts, sorta like a hummingbird

Suckin up the Lench Mob crew, and I'm comin third

Used to get straight A's, now she just skippin class

Oh my, do I like to grip the hips and ass

Only seventeen, with a lot of practice

on black boys jimmies and white boys cactus

Sorry sorry sir, but I gotta be brief

A lotta niggaz like bustin nuts in her teeth

Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic

that don't mean shit, cause she's givin up the ass quick

Quicker than you can say, ""Candy,""

the bitch is on my Snicker... and oh man she

can take on three men - built like He-Men

Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen

Fourteen niggaz in line ready to bang yo'

pride-and-joy, I mean daddy's little angel

Tell the little bitch to bring her ass out the house

cause your daughter's known, for givin up the nappy dug out



[Chorus: repeat 2X]



""I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch remains

I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!""

[Interlude: Pops]



[Pops]

Look motherfucker you better get from in front of my house

with that old god damn bullshit

You girlie-ass motherfucker

You better get out of here witcho' fine ass

Man, youse a little fine motherfucker



[Verse Two]

Mister, mister, before you make me go

I'm here to let you know your little girl is a hoe

Nympho, nympho, boy is she bad

Get her all alone and out comes the kneepads

I know she is a minor and it is illegal

but the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio

And if you de-cide to call rape

we got the little hooker on tape, now:

tell the fuckin slut to please hurry up

and wear that dress that's tight on her butt

So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed

Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead

Face turnin red from grabbin them ankles

Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes

You should hear how she sounds with a cock

And her boots get knocked, from here to Czechoslovakia

Two are on top, one on the bottom

First nigga got the boots; man, you shoulda shot him

cause after I got 'em it was over

Now niggaz get lucky like a four-leaf clover

on daddy's little girl.

She keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel

So tell Cheryl to bring her ass home

cause the line at my house is gettin loooooooong, ay!



[Chorus]

""I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch remains

I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!""

Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad

gots to get a job cuz I was a high school dad

Wish I got paid like I was rappin' to the nation

but thats not likely, so here's my application

Pass it to the man at AT&T

Cuz when I was in school I got the a. e. e.

But there's no s. e. for this youngsta

I didn't have no money so now I have to hunch the

Back like a slave, thats what be happenin

but whitey says there's no room for the African

Always knew that I would boycott, jeez

but welcome to McDonalds can I take your order please

Gotta sell ya food that might give you cancer

cuz my baby doesn't take no for an answer

Now I pay taxes that you never give me back

what about diapers, bottles, and similac

Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack

for decent shelter and clothes on my back?

Or should I just wait for help from Bush

or Jesse Jackson, and operation Push

If you ask me the whole thing needs a douch

a masengel what the hell cracker sale in the neighborhood

To the whorehouse bitches,

Miss porker, little joe or Todd Bridges

Or anybody that he know

so I got me a bird, better known as a kilo

Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough

So now you put the feds against me

cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency

I'm never givin' love again

Cuz blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican

Now I remember I used to be cool

till I stopped fillin' out my W-2

Now senators are gettin' hired

and your plan against the ghetto backfired

So now you got a pep talk

but sorry, this is our only room to walk

Cause we don't want a drug push

But a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush

[Verse One]

Here's another topic I'm addressin

so learn a quick lesson, about your Smith and Wesson

Sit your ass back and comprehend

as I let you know about man's best friend

Now remember: it used to be a dog like Lassie

but now in ninety-one it's a gun if you asked me

Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection

I use my nine when suckers start to flexin

Cause if you run up and try to play mine

I'd rather have a AK than a fuckin canine

Cause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetch her

me and the dog's goin out on a stretcher

And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that

big black gat, aim and I hit that

Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den

Nowadays.. a gat is man's best friend



[Chorus + Cube saying ""Man's best friend"" after *3 first time]



[Verse Two]

Here is the reason why Ice Cube pack

Just in case the little punks try to jack

I can't put a motherfuckin pitbull

under a coat, in the small of my back

So I gotta take my beretta, and I betcha

it'll probably work, a 100 percent better

Cause it'll keep me out of danger

with sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber

So this goes to all y'all intruders

Beware of the owner, cause the owner is a shooter

I don't just wanna give your ass rabies

I'd rather have your ass pushing up daisies

And I can't do that with Benji,

Rin Tin Tin, or Spuds McKenzie

Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den

Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend

Its me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop
The spot's hot and everybody nervous
That's when the blue car served us
Oh why did fools had to let loose
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce

Big Tom had to push us

13 niggaz runnin straight to the bushes

For they gats so they could draw down

But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down

Not known why I dropped out

Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out

So now I gotta jet

Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin wet

Tryin to see if we got him

Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom

Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out

Yelled to the homies then I blacked out



Woke up in the back of a tray

On my way, to MLK

That the county hospital jack

Where niggaz die over a little scratch

Still sittin in the trauma center

In my back is where the bullet entered

Yo nurse I'm gettin kind of warm

Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin form

Coughin up blood on my hands and knees

Then I heard ""freeze nigger don't move""

Yo, I didn't do a thing

Didn't wanna go out like my man Rodney King

Still got gaffled

Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel

Now I'm handcuffed

Being asked information on my gang affiliation

I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes

And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime



I need to see a MD

And ya'll mothafuckers giving me the third degree

Look at the waiting room

Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room

Nobody gettin help

Since we poor

The hospital move slow

Now I'm layed out

People steppin over me to get closer to the tv

Just like a piece of dog shit

Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet

One hour done passed

Done watched two episodes of M*A*S*H

And when I'm almost through

They call my name and put me on ICU

Halfway dead

No respect and handcuffed to the bed

Now the trauma starts

Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart

So I begin the ass kissin

Just to get looked at by an overworked physician

Got the chills, but my temperatures 103

Only got a band-aid and an IV

That's when I start cussin

Police steady askin me who did the bustin



Why oh why can't I get help

Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self

Too many black bodies the hospital housin

So at 10 P.M. I was Audi 5000"

[Cube] Huh-huh, huh-HAH..

""I'm comin!"" [repeat 3X]

[Cube] I'm comin!



[Verse One]

I wanna kill him, cause he tried to play me like the trick

but you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with

I got the A to the motherfuckin K, and it's ready to rip

Slapped in my banana clip

And I'm lookin.. (lookin..)

Is he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?

It seems like he got the whole country behind him

so it's sort of hard to find him

But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth

Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out

Cause the shit he did was uncalled for

tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore

And that shit ain't fly

So now I'm settin up, the ultimate drive-by

And when you hear this shit,

it make the world say ""DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam.""



""Do the niggaz run this moth-er-fuck-er?"" [repeat 2X]



[door knocking]

""Momma!! Some man at the front do'!""

""Sit yo' ass down.""

""Uhh hi.. I have reason to believe that someone in this household

has just turned eighteen, am I correct?""



[Verse Two]

Here's why I wanna kill the punk

cause he tried to take a motherfuckin chunk of the funk

He came to my house, I let 'em bail in

cause he said he was down with the L.M.

He gave up a little dap

then turned around, and pulled out a gat

I knew it was a caper

I said, ""Please don't kill my mother,"" so he raped her

Tied me up, took me outside

and I was thrown in a big truck

And it was packed like sardines

Full of niggaz, who fell for the same scheme

Took us to a place and made us work

all day and we couldn't have shit to say

Broke up the families forever

and to this day black folks can't stick together

And it's odd..

Broke us down, made us pray - to his God

And when I think about it,

it make me say ""DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam.""



""I'm comin!"" [repeat 3X]



[Verse Three]

Now in ninety-one, he wanna tax me

I remember, the son of a bitch used to axe me

and hang me by a rope til my neck snapped

Now the sneaky motherfucker wanna ban rap

and put me under dirt or concrete

But God, can see through a white sheet

Cause you the devil in drag

You can burn your cross well I'll burn your flag

Try to give me the H-I-V

so I can stop makin babies like me

And you're givin dope to my people chump

Just wait til we get over that hump

Cause yo' ass is grass cause I'ma blast

Can't bury rap, like you buried jazz

Cause we stopped bein whores, stop doin floors

So bitch you can fight your own wars

So if you see a man in red white and blue

gettin janked by the Lench Mob crew

It's a man who deserves to buckle

I wanna kill Sam cause he ain't my motherfuckin Uncle!

Lookin at my girlfriend's black skin

You wanna jump in, but she don't like white men

So don't throw that work you fuckin jerk

Or get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker

She ain't with the pale face

Cause y'all fuck at a snail's pace

And you might get sprayed with mace

By the ebony

So when she's doing her job you better let her be

Don't try to pinch the gluterus

Thinkin that you about to knock out the uterus

Cause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick

And where I'm from, devils get their ass kicked

Asking for a blow while the answer is ""fuck no""

Looks like you wanna terminate

But that's when I go Psycho like Norman Bates

I wanna kill the devil for talkin shit

Cause he can't get a taste of the chocolate

African breast; cause white bitches got no butt and no chest

Black women have bodies like goddesses

Sorta like Venus, but put away your penis

Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker

That's why I'm lighter than the average brother

Cause you raped our women and we felt it

But it'll never happen again if I can help it (me neither)

Cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet

So horny little devil, you better listen

Before your ass comes up missin

and it's like that



Now you wanna get me

Horny little must be a F-A-G

Tryin to fuck me out my land and my manhood

Got broke eating Spam and canned goods

Locking down on my neighborhoods

Treat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand

But my ass is a virgin

You mignt have fucked the Indians

but you can't surgeon me

And when I'm on top I wont be fuckin ya

I'd rather put a buck in ya

Cause I hate the devil with a passion

and when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin

Dig a hole and throw his ass in

And I won't be happy til I'm down to my last ten

Get his fuckin pitchfork

Tie him up, and then feed the bitch pork

Little devil wanna fuck me out my pay

But horny little devil true niggaz aren't gay

And you can't play with my Yo-Yo

and definitely can't play with me you fuckin homo

Cause we'll blow your head off

And turn that white sheet into a red cloth

Plus when they're all dead

I can quit that jheri juice and get a bald head

Then let it nap up

Go down to the corner store and beat the Jap up

Clean all the crap up

out my city

Now the whole block look shitty

Put his dick on a wood block

Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop

Now who's the next to nut

Color Me Badd, but you can't sex me up

So don't even try to put a dick in a die

Because this is what why in 1991 I'ma get my gun

Put an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel

I'm lookin in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test
With four brothas in the SS
I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin in the cut

Is this a jack or a kidnap?

Since I'm never ever slippin I fully strapped

I grab my gat out the glove

Now, do these fools got a problem with me?

Or do they got love?

So when the light turns green, I don't bone out

I wanna see what these black men are all about

Cuz if it's my time, I'm just short

If not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport

First they get behind my ride...

Then they switch lanes to the left side

I'm scopin out the one smokin indo

Comin up fast, rollin down his window

He threw up a sign, I put away my nine

Fool, cuz I'm color blind



Killa Cali, the state where they kill

Over colors cuz brothas don't know the deal

And they'll cap you, not if they have to

But if they want to, first they might confront you

But every nigga on my block can't stop

And he won't stop and he don't stop

Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang

And rookies ain't the only ones that drop

Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed

And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most

Say the wrong word

then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird

Bust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga

For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get

But men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split

It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me

Cuz I slang these thangs like a G

It's on, is anybody killin for the summertime

I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind



I'm fresh outta county on bail

And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail

For some gang related activity

Cuz everyday, different fools try to get with me

For no more than a color, or territory

Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story

So what's left, the judge goes deaf

When you try to tell your side

And you ain't blue eyed

Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin'

And just hand your car keys over to your woman

Because it aint no sunshine where you headed

And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it

But now, I got time to think

Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink

And I ain't even shed a tear

Cuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here

Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph

Cuz brothas, you don't know the half

On the streets I was damn near outta my mind

But ever since I've been down

I'm colorblind



Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine

I was told to peel a cap on the other side

Yo, young and dumb, full of come up, a baby loc

I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke



Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin

Cuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin

Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride

Started up the bucket and headed for the other side



Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip

Hit the 5 dollar stick and then I put in my clip



So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost

I had my mind set on sendin niggaz to Harrison Ross



Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes

Thinkin should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive

Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side



I ain't contributin to genocide (why?)

Cuz I'm colorblind



Niggaz in the hood ain't changed

And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang

Cuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn

Every which way I get burned baby

Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red

Put 'em together and we color 'em dead

Dead, dyin, gettin smoked like part of the fun

They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral



I understand how all my homeboys feel

Cuz I was shot and to this day, I pack my steel

Cuz I was born in a certain territory

Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories

With blue and red bandanas on the street

And if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep

Cuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind

And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind."

Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders
Fucking with the girls in the fourth grade

Walking with the schoolhouse bully

By doing that, I had a lot of pull, G

Cheating on tests, making a mess

Cussing like a sailor at recess

It must a been a half moon

Cause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom

Chewing on Good and Plenties

Got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies

Yo I was living like the class clown

Pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes man

When you young it's hard to see

That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD

Popping out your window with a BB gun

Better yet knocking on your door and run

Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank

Even though I was still shooting blanks

As soon as the dark hit

I was stealing candy out the corner market

Until I got my ass whipped

Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit



Thirteen, that's how old I was

When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz

And I was looking at any butt and ass

Me and my homies started cutting class

Going up to the high school

Looking for any bitch I could lie to

Tell em I was older than I really was

Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed

That's what a mack's made of

But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love

Hard as a rock the long way

And then I put the rubber on the wrong way

But I still gotta have it

Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit

Goddamn I was hype

A virgin but I still knew how to lay the pipe

Even though the ho worked me

I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque

Then the shit got strange, money

I started shaking and jimmy felt funny

Then the nut came gushing

I jumped up got dressed and start pushing

Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick

Cause I was still young doing dumb shit



At 17 got my first Volkswagen

And mastered the life-long art of dragging

To the women in college

Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge

Breaking in cars and all that

Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat

Fucking at a real fast rate

Til they said that I might not graduate

Then I said, ""Fuck the dumb shit

Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick

If things continue.""

So I start rapping about shit I been through

And I got real good

Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood

Trying to be baby macks

Doing shit that I did seven years back

Going through a stage

But before they can grow up they on the front page

And they moms is having a fit

Cause they died young, doing dumb shit"

But I'm the first nigga ta holler out {PEACE, BLACK MAN}

I beat my wife and children to a pulp

When I get drunk and smoke dope

Got a bad heart condition

Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's

Bet my money on the dice and the horses

Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces

Go to church but they tease us

Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus

They used to call me Negro

After all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe

No respect and ignored

And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford

In jail cause I can't pay the mother

Held back in life because of my color

Now this is just a little summary

Of US, but yall think it's dumb of me

To hold a mirror to ya face, but trust

Nobody gives a fuck about..."

Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft.
First you was down with the AK,
and now I see you on a video with Michel'le?
Lookin' like straight bozos.
I saw it comin', that's why I went solo.

And kept on stompin',

when ya'll mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton.

Livin' with the whites, one big house,

and not another nigga in site.

I started off with too much cargo,

dropped four niggas now I'm makin' all the dough.

White man just rulin'.

The Niggas With Attitudes -- who ya foolin'?

Ya'll niggas just phony,

I put that on my mama and my dead homeys.

Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin';

Ay yo Dre, stick to producin'.

Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-a-dick;

Eazy E saw your ass and went in it quick.

You got jealous when I got my own company,

but I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me.

Tryin' to sound like Amerikkka's Most,

you could yell all day but you don't come close.

Cuz you know I'm the one that flown,

ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go.

With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B, and ya'll disgrace the C-P-T.

Cuz you're gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy,

with no vaseline...



[Refrain]

[L.L. sample:] ""Now you're gettin' done without vaseline..."" [3x]

[Biz Markie sample:] ""Damn, it feels good to see people...on it""



The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin',

who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?

You're gettin' fucked real quick,

and Eazy's dick, is smellin' like MC Ren's shit.

Tried to tell you a year ago,

but Willie D told me to let a hoe be a hoe, so

I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked,

now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank.

Tried to dis Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it

cuz the broomstick fit your ass so perfect.

Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls,

cuz I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers.

Gang-banged by your manager, fella,

gettin' money out your ass, like a mothafuckin' Ready Teller.

Givin' up the dollar bills,

now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels.

So don't believe what Ren say,

cuz he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte,

but I got a whip for ya Toby;

used to be my homey, now you act like you don't know me.

It's a case of divide-and-conquer,

cuz you let a Jew break up my crew.

House nigga gotta run and hide,

yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside.

So don't front, MC Ren, cuz I remember when you drove a B 2-10.

Broke as a mothafuckin' joke.

Let you on the scene to back up the Verse Team.

It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart,

and they rippin' your asshole apart.

By takin' your green, oh yeah,

the Villain does get fucked with no vaseline.



[Refrain scratched]



I never have dinner with the President.

I never have dinner with the President.

I never have dinner with the President.

And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant.

Now I think you a snitch,

throw a house nigga in a ditch.

Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys.

You little maggot; Eazy E turned faggot.

With your manager, fella,

fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella.

But if they were smart as me,

Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree.

With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline.

Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on...

till that Jheri curl is gone.

On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation.

Heard you both got the same bank account,

dumb nigga, what you thinkin' bout?

Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple.

Cuz you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew

with a white Jew tellin' you what to do.

Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs.

With a midget who's a punk too,

tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you.

Eric Wright, punk, always into somethin', gettin' fucked at night.

Whassup nigga?
Get over there... shit

C'mere, c'mere, c'mere boy

God damnit you stop that shit now

Take him to jail and get him the hell from in front of this house

Now wait a minute, wait a minute, hey man

Whassup?

Wait a minute?

There are police, go!



[Verse One:]



Give me that beat fool, it's a full time jack move

Chilly Chill, yo homie mack the track move

And I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank

That's the name of the SUCKERS I done ganked

I get away from a copper

Drop a dime, I'll break you off somethin proper

With the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B

T-Bone and that's J.D.

And here's how we'll greet ya

Stop fool, come off that beat ya

feel dumb cause you're caught in the dark

(ya lil nuttin ass mark)

Raise up, cause you cant' have it back

You said - ""I ain't never got gaffled like that""

Off the end of the gat you choke

Short Dog's in the house - ""Whattup loc?""

Nuttin but a come up

Gimme that bass, and don't try to run up

Cause you'll get banked somethin sweet

Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin for beats



[Verse Two:]



Huh, and even if you're down with my crew

(Yo Chuck man, i dodn't understand this man

You got to slow down)

I jack them too

And then we'll freak it

Kick that bass, and look what we did

Fade the grade, played, and made a few mil

and I keep stealin

Ice Cube'll make it funky

But right about now - *let's get up in the hump*

But I don't party and shake my butt

I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircurs

And it'll drive you nuts

Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch

Like jackin at night

Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin

And it sounds so sweet

Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin for beats



[Verse Three:]



Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it

Locate a dope break, and then I break it

And give it that gangsta lean

Dead in your face as I turn up the bass

I make punk suckers run and duck because

I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to

jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi

So when I come to your town don't crowd me

Cause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me

But I know, none of y'all can get with me

So you think you're protected

Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record

Then I have to show and prove and use your groove

Cause suckers can't fade the Cube

And if I jack you and you keep comin

I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!

Nigga, some don't think I can flow, so here we go
to a new track, to show the wack, that I can throw
styles that show up, I blow up and blast here
Niggaz still trippin off the shit I said last year

About a bitch is a bitch is a hoe is a slut

And I don't like niggaz on my nuts!

So I dedicate this one to the groupie

And the Charlie, all on my Snoopy

Brothers keep askin, ""Ice Cube yo when will you bust""

They surround me and make a big fuss

Now I was taught, back on my block

That you don't ride on nobody's jock

for anything they do, FUCK him and his crew

Unless, you were gettin paid too!

I'm not saying this to diss each and every fan

Women you can ride, man be a man!

Shake my hand, and make it a FIRM shake

Say, ""Whattup Ice Cube?"" and then break

Cause if you're hangin there I'ma tell you loud and clear

Get off my my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here

Motherfucker, back up off me

I'm not signin no autographs, I'm not givin no free t-shirts

And I'm not HAVIN none of this bullshit you're talkin

YouknowhatI'msayin?



(""Get off my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here"")



I step into the club, to rub-a-dub

It seems like all the little hoes fall in love

with my money, cause yo about a year ago

I was just your ordinary average everyday crazy ass bro

But you know, I just can't be equal

Cause they know, I know a lot of famous people

But to a one-night stand, there's no sequel

Here's the pickle, pretend it's a popsicle

See for a fat booty, I do damage

They think I'm a star, so I take advantage

It's just another Ice Cube groupie test

She's a hoe cause they knew her at the front desk

Told her to meet me, at the room 110

And the bitch showed up, with her boyfriend

I let him in, all he could do was grin

He had a camera, a t-shirt, a pad and pen

He said, ""Yo Ice Cube, can you sign this?""

I only did it cause his bitch was the finest

She blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown

Like - how can we get rid of this clown?

Me and her sat down, he got a little jealous

Cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us

And he asked me question after question

It felt like a motherfuckin interview session

Then his girl got up, I heard the do' shut

And he was still there, swingin from my nuts

I said, ""Get the FUCK out!"" and made it loud and clear

Get off my dick nigga, and tell your bitch to come here



I see me about ten mark ass motherfuckers fans

knock on the door, talkin about whassup?



Yo man, it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man

Niggaz start, niggaz comin out of hotel rooms

without no bitches!



They can get gaffled like they in a motherfuckin raffle

Punk ass



[Ice Cube]

Yo, I respect the respectable

If your girl is all on my dick, check the hoe

Say, ""Yeah that nigga he can rap fly

But you know, stars are up in the sky""

Cause all I got is hard dick, and bubblegum

Just ran out my last stick is where I'm comin from

I'm not tellin you to diss Mr. Ice Cube

Cause you know, I'm the one that can show and prove

Now groupie girls, I just make em wait

But the groupie boys, I can't tolerate

I hate it so much, I'ma start givin stitches

to the niggaz that's starin like bitches

Cause I'm not a fairy, a Mary or a faggot

Gimme the eye, I'll fly, and tag it

Now you see? Jockin ain't healthy

Cause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy?

With juice, so I see you try to run behind

But I'ma tell you punk, you gets none of mine

Cause I was taught, see a fool, use a fool

by the niggaz who terrorized the old school

So don't try me or buy me a beer"

In and out was the movement of the bozack
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin
Then the nut came gushin
And it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary
With nuttin but the Lord lookin over me

I was white with a tail

But when I reached the finish line, young black male!

One cell made two, and two cells made fo'

and so on, so now I'm a embryo

Then I got a hunch

that I'ma be on lockdown, for nine months

Chillin, with my mother to guide me

And nuttin but a stomach to hide me

from all that worry and bullshit

Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick

cause my time is up and I don't care

With one big push, I'm outta there

June 15th, it's just my luck

In 1969, a nigga is the product



""Ghetto ass nigga, you ain't shit,

and you ain't gon' never be shit!""



I learned how to walk and talk and all that

They put me in school, but it don't matter

Cause I'm sittin in history

Learnin bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me

They try to shape us

But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin rapist

So I stopped payin attention

Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention

Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways

I'm sent home and I don't got all A's

A high school dropout

My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out

But I got tossed, he's the boss

I'm out of there and mad cause I lost

Now bein on my own is a factor

So I become, the neighborhood jacker

Gimme your car, run your jewels

Makin a livin robbin fools

And if I let my nine rang out

You know, it'll make your brains hang out

So what's your fate?

Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate?

The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled

I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red

And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck

Stuck up by the motherfuckin product



""Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job

if you wanna stay in my motherfuckin house""



""Many young men reject the traditional values

that are important to their parents.

Church, school and family

have been replaced by street, turf, and gang.""



Twenty-one now, and paid in full

Feelin bad, from all the shit I pulled

on people back in the day

Plus, I got a little baby on the way

So I'm tryin to go straight

I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date

Til the punk ass cops ran my plate

Now I'm on a bus upstate



""Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!""

""Sittin in the mess hall, sayin my grace"" -> LL Cool J



Sent to a concrete hoe-house

Where all the products go, no doubt

Yo momma, I gotta do eleven

Livin in a five by seven

Dear baby, your man's gettin worn out

of seein young boys gettin they assholes torn out

And then he got shanked with a spoon

And he was 'sposed to get out soon

Is it my fault, he was caught in production

Where a young black life means nothin

Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar

you say I'm better off in the slammer

And it's drivin me batty

Cause my little boy, is missin daddy

I'm ashamed, but the fact is

I wish pops let me off on the mattress

Or should I just hang from the top bunk

But that's goin out like a punk

My life is FUCKED!

But it ain't my fault, cause I'm the motherfuckin product



""He ain't shit"""

Up early in the morning, dressed in black
Don't ask why? 'Cause I'm down in a suit and tie
They killed a homie that I went to school with (Damn!)
I tell ya life ain't shit to fool with

I still hear the screams of his mother

While my nigga laid dead in the gutter (Shit!)

And it's getting to my temple

Why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?

It makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-in

And have some bodies hauled in

But no, I pay my respects and I'm through (whaddup Cube?)

Hug my crew, and maybe shed a tear or two

And I wanna get blitz

Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce

About a brother who had to be the one and only

So I dedicate this to my dead homiez...



[Verse Two:]



Another homie got murdered on a shakedown [three gun shots]

And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown

Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted [two gun shots]

A framed picture and a closed casket

A single file line about 50 cars long

All drivin' slow with they lights on

He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath

What good is that when you're six feet deep?

I look at that shit and gotta think to myself

And thank God for my health

'Cause nobody really ever know

When it's gonna be they family on the front row

So I take everything slow, go with the flow

And shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know (Word!)

'Cause that's what Pops told me

But I wish he could have said it...to my dead homiez



[Verse Three:]



I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun

Now it's ""Rest in Peace"" after every one

Except me, but I ain't the one to front

Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month

Plus, I knew him when he was yea big

Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig

But somethin' ain't right

When it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight

Lovin' each other in a caring mood

There's lots of people and lots of food

They say ""Be Strong"" and you're tryin'

But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?

So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up

Because the city is so fuckin' messed up

And everybody is so phony

Take a little time...to think about your dead homiez."

You gotta deal with the nine-double-M

Just think if niggas decide to retaliate

They try to keep me from running up

I never tell you to get down it's all about coming up

So what they do go and ban the AK?

My shit wasn't registered any fucking way

So you better duck away run and hide out

When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out

Cause I'm about to fuck up the program

Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham

When I'm shooting let's see who drop

The police the media and suckers that went pop

And motherfuckers that say they too black

Put em overseas they be begging to come back

They say keep em on gangs and drugs

Yyou wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug

Kicking shit called street knowledge

Why more niggas in the pen than in college?

Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate

That's from the nigga ya love to hate

Yo runnin through the line like Bo

It's no pot to piss in

I put my fist in

Cause I don't fake you're begging I fall off

The crossover might as well cut them balls off

And get your ass ready for the lynching

The mob is droppin common sense and

We'll gank in the pen will shank

Any Tom Dick and Hank or get the ass

Fake it ain't about how right or wrong you live

But how long you live

I ain't with the bullshit

I meet cold bitches no hoes

Don't wanna sleep so I keep popping No-Doz

And tell the young people what they gotta know

Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low

And if you're locked up I dedicate my style in

From San Quentin to Rykers Island

We got em afraid of the funky shit

I like to clown so pump up the sound

In the jeep make the old ladies say

Oh my god wait it's the nigga ya love to hate

Yeah come on fool

It's the nigga you love to hate



Yeah run up punk

It's the nigga you love to hate

I ain't nobody's bitch>

A bitch is a....



Soul Train done lost they soul

Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes

I see a lotta others damn

It almost look like the Bandstand

You ask me did I like Arsenio

About as much as the bicentennial

I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools cause they all scared of

the Ice Cube

And what I say what I portray and all that

And ain't even seen the gat

I don't wanna see no dancing

I'm sick of that shit listen to the hit

Cause yo if I look and see another brother

On the video tryin to out-dance each other

I'm a tell T-Bone to pass the bottle

And don't give me that shit about role model

It ain't wise to chastise and preach

Just open the eyes of each

Cause laws are made to be broken up

What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up

And build mold and fold theyself into shape

What's the date and time it don't matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into this girl named Carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala

She said what's up yeah what's the deal

Check the hairdo of course it ain't real

Then I looked down she was fat in the front

I asked how long, well about seven months

Oh how time flies when you're having fun

She said yeah but the damage is done

Where you been, on a little vacation

Oh by the way congratulations

Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue

Then she said the lucky man is you

I dropped my brew

And everything looked fuzzy

Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy

She said yeah remember that date

I thought back and tried to calculate

Then I said damn are you sure it's mine

Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times

She said that day no I wasn't whoring

Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring

Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court

Paying a gang on child support

Then I thought deep about giving up the money

What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy

Naw cause then I'd really get faded

That's murder one cause it was premeditated

So what I'm a do

I don't have a clue

How many months left damn only two

I'm gettin faded



No cigar, G

Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded



It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her

I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her

See the booty and the front was all in place

But the girl had the pitbull face

So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid

Oh lord god forbid

My homies see me at the motel

Cause those fools would love to just go tell

Everybody in the hood that knows your rep

So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept

And hold your big fat butt steady

Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready

She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey

I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque

I dropped her off man and I'm knowing

That I'm a hate myself in the morning

I got drunk to help me forget

Yo another day another hit shit

I'm gettin faded



Ay yo you know what time it is



Nine months later she's ready to drop the load

And everybody in the hood already knows

It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me

You know Ice Cube can't be having that G

I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her

Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger

JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up

I'm gettin fed up bitch

Cause I know you're tryin to break me

But if I find out your tryin to fake me

I'm a buff that duff for a hoot

Beat ya down and leave a crown or two

That night she went into labor

And the shit is getting kinda major

The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver

Looking like my next-door neighbor

She said it was mine that was her best guess

But let's check the results of the blood test

I started smiling yeah cause it read negative

Damn why did I let her live?

After that I should've got the gat

And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap

But no I just told the hoe who laid me

Excuse me bitch it's a switch

You can't fade me



Naw baby not this way

Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger

I don't fall for the okey-doke

And before I fall for the okey-doke

I let the pistol smoke

Now sing it

Yeah baby you can't fade me

Naw unfadable baby"

I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - ""Who is it?""
It's Ice Cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggers in the parking lot
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot

I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable

and then I put my Nikes on the coffee table

Her brother walked in he's into gangbangin

cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""

I don't bang I write the good rhymes

The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times

I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut

by a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up

He threw up a set and then he was gone,

I'm thinkin to myself, wont this bitch bring her ass on.

Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth

and fired up the sess it was sess no doubt

She said please excuse my house and all that

I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact

Lookin at a fucked up black and white

her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right

She had another brother that was three years old

and had a bad case of the runny nose

He asked me who I was then I had to pause

It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers

I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked

only thirteen and already pregnant

I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig

cause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids

They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin

and tellin and look at this young punk bailin

I heard a knock on the door without the password

and her mom's got the 12 guage Mossberg

The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""

and the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo

She made the drop and got the 20 dollars

from a smoked out fool with ring around the collar

The girl I was waiting for came out

I said BITCH I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS A CRACK HOUSE

I got my coat and SUDDENLY ...

(police breaking into house annoucing themselves)

The cop busted in and had a Mac-10 pointed to my dome

and I said to myself once again it's on

He threw me on the carpet, and wasn't cuttin no slack

stomped on my head and put his knee in my back

First he tried to wrap me up, slap me up, rough me up

They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up

I said FUCK how much abuse can a nigga take

Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake

Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope

He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case

He said get out my face I musta had a grudge

His reply tell that bullshit to the judge

The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin

I said AIYYO BITCH you better tell em SOMETHIN

She started draggin and all of a sudden

we all got tossed in the patty wagon

Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point

I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint

Now the story you heard has one little object

DON'T FUCK WITH A BITCH FROM THE PROJECTS!"

First I load the clip and then I make the hit
I know some y'all can't fade this
Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
So you and your boys are ass-out
When I'm rollin in a seven-deuce glass house

The Mob ain't nothing but a menace

When we get the motherfucking dog in us

Playing them old beats

I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies

Ready to peel your cap

You can't believe ""Faces of Death"" on wax

Some say the Mob ain't positive

Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live

How I live and you could either give a fuck punk

Yo or get your ass bucked

Some rappers are heaven-sent

But Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent

So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job

I'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob



To be down with the Mob is simple

Mind your own you want a spot find your own

And take mine if you're badder than the strong man

I do the right thing I do the wrong thing

Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene

It's all about how much bacon you bring

And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it

Yo you ain't seen nothing

Cause if you testify you're living blind

Cause in the city you live and let die

Rolling with the fools One Time can't beat

On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet

He said ""I know you"" I said ""you might

My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like""

So he soaked me up like Bounty

Had to do a week in the county

A piece of cake it was just like a party

Cause in the county you know everybody

No I didn't kill or steal or rob

Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob



If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob

Watch your step cause the gat is kept

In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo

You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no

Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out

After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out

Get the picture or bitch

You'll get the eighty-six

If she wanna try and mix

Business and pleasure make up your own mind

You gotta be a hoe on your own time

Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep

Yo the Mob is still deep

And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit

You thought you got with the crew you can't get with

So get the noose ready for the lynching

Now 235 is what I'm benching

But nowadays it's still not enough

I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush

Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job

Rolling with the motherfucking Lench Mob"

Who's the mack? is it some brother in a big hat
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?

Rolling in a fucked-up Lincoln

Leaning to the side So it looks like he's sinking

Into that leopard interior

This nigga thinks every girl's inferior

To his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung

As she's selling more butt

Don't even get a cut of the money

His name is Sonny

And he know the play

And hope to od that he don't find a runaway

That's looking to become a star

He'll have your ass in and out of every car

With every on and Rick, sucking every john's dick

Come short of the money, get your ass kicked

You don't like it but you still call him hunk

Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk

You wanna leave but Sonny started talking fast

And it make you wanna go and sell more ass

He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that

Now ask yourself

Who's the mack?

Who's the mack?



It is that fool that wanna pump the gas

Give you a sad story and you give him cash?

He starts macking and macking and you sucking

Quick to say I'm down on my luck

And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way

Then you see his sorry ass the next day

Are you the one getting played like a sucka?

Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherfucker""?

Every day, the story gets better

He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-assed sweater

He claims he wants to get something to eat

But every day you find yourself getting beat

He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways

'cause he's in a daze

And almost get his ass hit for the crack

Now ask yourself

Who's the mack?

Who's the Mack?



Is it that nigga in that club asking

Have you ever been in a hot tub?

I know the game so I watch it unfold

When i see the boy pinned to your earlobe

He's talking shit and you crack a smile

When he tell you that he can go buck wild

For a girl like you and make it feel good

You know it's drama but it sound real good

He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging

The pussy so he can keep bragging

He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?""

The pussy so he can keep bragging

You wanna do it but you feeling like a H-O-E

You grab his hand, you leave and it's over

'Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover

Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back

Now ask yourself

Who's the Mack?

Macking is the game and everybody's playing

And as long as you believe what they saying

Consider the a M.A.C.K. and with no delay

They are gonna get all the play

But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma

It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a

Mack in my own right

When it comes to rhyme and rap

'cause all i do is kick facts

Unlike Iceberg Slimm

And all of them be claimin' be P.I.M.P.

No, I'm not going out that way

I'm just a straight up N I double G A

Next time U get over on a fool

And you did the shit like real smooth

Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts

And ask yourself

Who's the Mack?

Straight gangsta Mack

Straight gangsta Mack

[Ice Cube]
Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand

Cause after I do ya

Huh I never knew ya

Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits

They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits

Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow

After we do it you can go home now

I'm a brother with a big long...



[Yo-Yo]

First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo

When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no

Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in

Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in

No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore

And if that's what you're here for

Exit through the door

There's more

To see of me but you're blind so

Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0



[Ice Cube]

Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo

I know you like to rap and like to flow so

But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world

Stay down and play the playground you little girl



[Yo-Yo]

What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping

Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening

It never fails I'll always get respect

And you lose so take a rain check



[Ice Cube]

Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second

If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant

And barefoot complaining that your back is aching

Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon



[Yo-Yo]

Well you're mistaken

It's not going that far

I make brothers like you play the back yard

You used to flow with the title but I took it

Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it



[Ice Cube]

Damn it look it

Cause you're talking a lot of bull



[Yo-Yo]

Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull



[Ice Cube]

This is a man's world thank you very much



[Yo-Yo]

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch



[Break]



[Ice Cube]

Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives

I hear females always talkin about women's lib

Well get your own crib

And stay there

Instead of having more babies for the welfare

Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger

The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga

For you to look at when your hair get nappy

So take a piece of the pole and be happy



[Yo-Yo]

Hell no because to me you're not a thriller

You come in the room with your three-inch killer

Thinking you can do damage to my backbone

Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown

I'm a put it like this my man

Without us your hand would be your best friend

So give us credit like you know you should

If I don't look good you don't look good



[Ice Cube]

I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant



[Yo-Yo]

But you don't know how funky that I can get



[Ice Cube]

This is a man's world thank you very much



[Yo-Yo]

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch



[Break]



[Ice Cube]

Man women I put a lot of fear in em

Cause I had it up to here with em

Drink a beer with em

No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day

Yeah if you know what I mean baby



[Yo-Yo]

Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe

If you was more of a man instead of faking it

Women deserve the credit when they're making it



[Ice Cube]

Yeah so what's the problem



[Yo-Yo]

Well I think we solved it

I know they know the best male from who's doggin it



[Ice Cube]

Yeah I admit you can flow



[Yo-Yo]

Well that's true



[Ice Cube]

But you see I'm a pro with the bank too



[Yo-Yo]

Yeah I can see you got it good



[Ice Cube]

Oh that I know



[Yo-Yo]

But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo

The brand-new intelligent black lady



[Ice Cube]

You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me



[Yo-Yo]

So what up then



[Ice Cube]

Girl what you tryin to do



[Yo-Yo]

To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through



[Ice Cube]

This is a man's world thank you very much



[Yo-Yo]

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Too much knowledge kicked then you're lost
In a shuffle of feet, Jinx the fiddler
And I control your mind like Hitler
You bow and vow to authority
See now, a sucker with a style just boring me

So I show K.N.O.W.

L.E.D.G.E. it might trouble you

Then I transform like a Decepticon

With a mic as a bomb

In my right palm

But I don't stay calm

So panic

Others can't flow so they go schizophrenic

You thought I dropped a dud in your face

Until you taste the blood of the bass

Then you faint, or better yet pass out

When I'm on the mic, believe it's ass out

You think you're raw so you draw

You lose, you're hung, you bite your tongue

The whole town saw in awe as you strangle

A noose on your neck, and you dangle

From side to side in the blazing heat

You're beat, you're dead, the fools fell off

You feel you're turning red, it's said

That your head burst

And this is only the first verse

Of the bomb



[Break]



Don't break up the fight let them rumble

Over the years I've watched some go super-bad quick

Now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach

Now ask yourself, who's stupid?

I take funky funky beats and I loop it

And pimp slap you in the face with the bass

And the boom from the bomb that I drop

Stop

You have a flat top as a fashion

I love Black women with a passion

But when they gotta go and show their ass in

I gotta clown the hoes, yeah

You gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres

They'll steer you wrong

Ice Cube's got it going on, hit me

For the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme

The system ain't wholesome

They want to put a young brother in Folsom

And others see me on lockdown

But I come up foul then they get knocked out, word

To the brother that rolls the herb

Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that

Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact

He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap

Now who's the mack?

Who's the hoe?

Who's the trick?

I got many, many styles won't you take a pick

But don't be alarmed

When I trip and stumble and fumble

And drop the (rewind)

Drop the bomb



[Break]



I'm solo, you ask how I'm living

Still dropping more shit than a pigeon

With the L, the E, the N, the C, the H,

The M, the O, the B, the great

Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha

It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers

And if you try to upset the pot son

You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun

I make the beats, I make the breaks

I make the rhymes that make you shake

Make you find

Ice Cube never caught in the middle

I make shit to kick you in the ass a little

And still never hesitate to stutter step

Or bust a repitition on the mic

Still dissing all the hype

From left to right

How many left to fight?

So what that Lench Mob like?"

But I don't party and shake my butt

I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircurs

And it'll drive you nuts

Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch

Like jackin at night

Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin

And it sounds so sweet

Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin for beats



[Verse Three:]



Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it

Locate a dope break, and then I break it

And give it that gangsta lean

Dead in your face as I turn up the bass

I make punk suckers run and duck because

I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to

jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi

So when I come to your town don't crowd me

Cause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me

But I know, none of y'all can get with me

So you think you're protected

Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record

Then I have to show and prove and use your groove

Cause suckers can't fade the Cube

And if I jack you and you keep comin

I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!

In and out was the movement of the bozack
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin
Then the nut came gushin
And it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary
With nuttin but the Lord lookin over me

I was white with a tail

But when I reached the finish line, young black male!

One cell made two, and two cells made fo'

and so on, so now I'm a embryo

Then I got a hunch

that I'ma be on lockdown, for nine months

Chillin, with my mother to guide me

And nuttin but a stomach to hide me

from all that worry and bullshit

Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick

cause my time is up and I don't care

With one big push, I'm outta there

June 15th, it's just my luck

In 1969, a nigga is the product



""Ghetto ass nigga, you ain't shit,

and you ain't gon' never be shit!""



I learned how to walk and talk and all that

They put me in school, but it don't matter

Cause I'm sittin in history

Learnin bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me

They try to shape us

But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin rapist

So I stopped payin attention

Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention

Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways

I'm sent home and I don't got all A's

A high school dropout

My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out

But I got tossed, he's the boss

I'm out of there and mad cause I lost

Now bein on my own is a factor

So I become, the neighborhood jacker

Gimme your car, run your jewels

Makin a livin robbin fools

And if I let my nine rang out

You know, it'll make your brains hang out

So what's your fate?

Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate?

The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled

I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red

And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck

Stuck up by the motherfuckin product



""Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job

if you wanna stay in my motherfuckin house""



""Many young men reject the traditional values

that are important to their parents.

Church, school and family

have been replaced by street, turf, and gang.""



Twenty-one now, and paid in full

Feelin bad, from all the shit I pulled

on people back in the day

Plus, I got a little baby on the way

So I'm tryin to go straight

I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date

Til the punk ass cops ran my plate

Now I'm on a bus upstate



""Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!""

""Sittin in the mess hall, sayin my grace"" -> LL Cool J



Sent to a concrete hoe-house

Where all the products go, no doubt

Yo momma, I gotta do eleven

Livin in a five by seven

Dear baby, your man's gettin worn out

of seein young boys gettin they assholes torn out

And then he got shanked with a spoon

And he was 'sposed to get out soon

Is it my fault, he was caught in production

Where a young black life means nothin

Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar

you say I'm better off in the slammer

And it's drivin me batty

Cause my little boy, is missin daddy

I'm ashamed, but the fact is

I wish pops let me off on the mattress

Or should I just hang from the top bunk

But that's goin out like a punk

My life is FUCKED!

But it ain't my fault, cause I'm the motherfuckin product



""He ain't shit"""

Up early in the morning, dressed in black
Don't ask why? 'Cause I'm down in a suit and tie
They killed a homie that I went to school with (Damn!)
I tell ya life ain't shit to fool with

I still hear the screams of his mother

While my nigga laid dead in the gutter (Shit!)

And it's getting to my temple

Why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?

It makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-in

And have some bodies hauled in

But no, I pay my respects and I'm through (whaddup Cube?)

Hug my crew, and maybe shed a tear or two

And I wanna get blitz

Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce

About a brother who had to be the one and only

So I dedicate this to my dead homiez...



[Verse Two:]



Another homie got murdered on a shakedown [three gun shots]

And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown

Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted [two gun shots]

A framed picture and a closed casket

A single file line about 50 cars long

All drivin' slow with they lights on

He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath

What good is that when you're six feet deep?

I look at that shit and gotta think to myself

And thank God for my health

'Cause nobody really ever know

When it's gonna be they family on the front row

So I take everything slow, go with the flow

And shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know (Word!)

'Cause that's what Pops told me

But I wish he could have said it...to my dead homiez



[Verse Three:]



I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun

Now it's ""Rest in Peace"" after every one

Except me, but I ain't the one to front

Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month

Plus, I knew him when he was yea big

Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig

But somethin' ain't right

When it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight

Lovin' each other in a caring mood

There's lots of people and lots of food

They say ""Be Strong"" and you're tryin'

But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?

So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up

Because the city is so fuckin' messed up

And everybody is so phony

Take a little time...to think about your dead homiez."

That's why I'm sick of gettin treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-M
The damn scum that you all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate

They try to keep me from running up

I never tell you to get down it's all about coming up

So what they do go and ban the AK?

My shit wasn't registered any fucking way

So you better duck away run and hide out

When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out

Cause I'm about to fuck up the program

Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham

When I'm shooting let's see who drop

The police the media and suckers that went pop

And motherfuckers that say they too black

Put em overseas they be begging to come back

They say keep em on gangs and drugs

Yyou wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug

Kicking shit called street knowledge

Why more niggas in the pen than in college?

Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate

That's from the nigga ya love to hate



[BREAK]



Yeah, ha-ha, it's the nigga you love to hate



Ay yo baby, your mother warned you about me

It's the nigga you love to hate



Yo, you ain't doing nothing pops for the brothers

What you got to say for yourself?>

You do like how I'm living? Well, fuck you



Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho

Ice Cube the bitch killa cap peeler

Yo runnin through the line like Bo

It's no pot to piss in

I put my fist in

Now who do ya love to hate

Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball

Cause I don't fake you're begging I fall off

The crossover might as well cut them balls off

And get your ass ready for the lynching

The mob is droppin common sense and

We'll gank in the pen will shank

Any Tom Dick and Hank or get the ass

Fake it ain't about how right or wrong you live

But how long you live

I ain't with the bullshit

I meet cold bitches no hoes

Don't wanna sleep so I keep popping No-Doz

And tell the young people what they gotta know

Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low

And if you're locked up I dedicate my style in

From San Quentin to Rykers Island

We got em afraid of the funky shit

I like to clown so pump up the sound

In the jeep make the old ladies say

Oh my god wait it's the nigga ya love to hate



[BREAK]



Yeah come on fool

It's the nigga you love to hate



Yeah run up punk

It's the nigga you love to hate



You ain't all that

That's all I hear, bitch, bitch

I ain't nobody's bitch>

A bitch is a....



Soul Train done lost they soul

Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes

I see a lotta others damn

It almost look like the Bandstand

You ask me did I like Arsenio

About as much as the bicentennial

I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools cause they all scared of

the Ice Cube

And what I say what I portray and all that

And ain't even seen the gat

I don't wanna see no dancing

I'm sick of that shit listen to the hit

Cause yo if I look and see another brother

On the video tryin to out-dance each other

I'm a tell T-Bone to pass the bottle

And don't give me that shit about role model

It ain't wise to chastise and preach

Just open the eyes of each

Cause laws are made to be broken up

What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up

And build mold and fold theyself into shape

Of the nigga ya love to hate"

I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - ""Who is it?""
It's Ice Cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggers in the parking lot
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot

I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable

and then I put my Nikes on the coffee table

Her brother walked in he's into gangbangin

cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""

I don't bang I write the good rhymes

The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times

I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut

by a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up

He threw up a set and then he was gone,

I'm thinkin to myself, wont this bitch bring her ass on.

Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth

and fired up the sess it was sess no doubt

She said please excuse my house and all that

I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact

Lookin at a fucked up black and white

her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right

She had another brother that was three years old

and had a bad case of the runny nose

He asked me who I was then I had to pause

It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers

I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked

only thirteen and already pregnant

I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig

cause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids

They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin

and tellin and look at this young punk bailin

I heard a knock on the door without the password

and her mom's got the 12 guage Mossberg

The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""

and the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo

She made the drop and got the 20 dollars

from a smoked out fool with ring around the collar

The girl I was waiting for came out

I said BITCH I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS A CRACK HOUSE

I got my coat and SUDDENLY ...

(police breaking into house annoucing themselves)

The cop busted in and had a Mac-10 pointed to my dome

and I said to myself once again it's on

He threw me on the carpet, and wasn't cuttin no slack

stomped on my head and put his knee in my back

First he tried to wrap me up, slap me up, rough me up

They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up

I said FUCK how much abuse can a nigga take

Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake

Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope

He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case

He said get out my face I musta had a grudge

His reply tell that bullshit to the judge

The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin

I said AIYYO BITCH you better tell em SOMETHIN

She started draggin and all of a sudden

we all got tossed in the patty wagon

Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point

I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint

[Verse One: Ice Cube]



Little boys and girls, they all love me

Come sit on the lap of I-C-E

And let me tell ya a story or two

About a punk-ass nigga I knew

Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick

Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick

Ran up the street cause he was piping hot

Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop

Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe

At that type of shit he's a pro

So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap

Dumb bitch, gave him the claps

Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay

Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way

To make some money, why not?

Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot

There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe

Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew

For the man that was really important

Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan

Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes

Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes

He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out

Saw, her and her friends sellin sheepskins



[Little Bo Peep]

Yo yo I got them sheepskins

Yo, my empty sheepskins

Yo baby, what's up with that?



Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock

Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock

I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course

Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs

Saw a fight over colors, too

Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue

A bad influence? Yo I don't know

But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go



[Interlude: Little Russ]



Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it

This is Little Russ in the house

Rock that shit homey, rock that shit!

(Well, you know the rest)



[Verse Two: Ice Cube]



Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall

With a joint, drinkin some 8-ball

Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville

Lookin for, the wolf to kill

They're fucked up and they want revenge

Them and Humpty used to be friends

Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor

Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him

Cinderella hoeing for the fellas

And Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous

Of the cash that the pigs were makin

Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon

Cause Mister Rogers found out quick

That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits

They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next

So Mister Rogers better watch his step

So he let the wolf know

We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho

Cause Cinderella is much too fast

Before twelve, givin up ass

Double barrels all loaded and cocked

As soon as they show, they gonna get popped

They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em

Little Boy Blue is up front givin orders

Little did they know Cinderella was a fink

She called the cops and got thrown in the clink

A bad influence? Yo, I don't know

But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go



[Outro: Little Russ, Ice Cube]



[Cube] Aiyyo man was that dope enough for you?

[Russ] Yeah you aight, you in the house

We outta here, seeeee-yaaaaa

[Cube] Yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass



[Barney Rubble] Some bedtime story huh?

[Bugs Bunny] It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't wanna live here

Well two bees in a bucket
Mother motherfuck it
You either Flavor Flav it

Or you Chuck Chuck Chuck it

Kiss my ass or suck a D.I.C.-

K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me

I fucked that lady in the bed

I missed that pussy and I bust a spread

I tried it again in a thumping wagon

The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging

Tried it again and I failed to grasp

I missed that pussy and I bust my ass

Then I fucked this lady in the tree

The baby came out and said ""Run-DMC""



[Ice Cube]

I knew this girl who looked just like you

Light brown and a fly hair-do

I wanted to do her, screw her

So I stepped to her

On-key bitch had more ass than a donkey

I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over

Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over

Just call me the plumber at the end of the night

Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe

She didn't get offended it was splendid to me

Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be

I guess I just wine her and dine her

And by the end of the night I'll be behind her

Waxing that ass like Rain Dance

On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her

Took her to the Comfort Inn

Tucked her in

Pulled out the third leg pumped it in

She said will you call me

Yeah I'll call you a bitch or a hoe after I ball ya

Naw I'm just playin but it's still the same

Cause a nigga like Ice Cube is only out for one thang"

So here we go
To a new track
To show the wack
That I can throw styles that show up
I blow up and blast here

Niggas still tripping off the shit I said last year

About a bitch is bitch is a bitch is a bitch

Then I got rich but I'll never switch

So I dedicate this one to the groupie

And the Charlie all on my Snoopy

Brothers keep asking Ice Cube yo when will you bust

They surround me and make a big fuss

Now I was taught back on my block

That you don't ride on nobody's jock

For anything they do

Fuck him and his crew

Unless you were gettin paid too

I'm not saying this to dis each and every fan

Women you can ride but man be a man

Shake my hand and make it a firm shake

Say what's up Ice Cube and then break

Cause if you're hangin there I'm a tell you loud and clear

First I load the clip and then I make the hit
I know some y'all can't fade this
Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
So you and your boys are ass-out
When I'm rollin in a seven-deuce glass house

The Mob ain't nothing but a menace

When we get the motherfucking dog in us

Playing them old beats

I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies

Ready to peel your cap

You can't believe ""Faces of Death"" on wax

Some say the Mob ain't positive

Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live

How I live and you could either give a fuck punk

Yo or get your ass bucked

Some rappers are heaven-sent

But Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent

So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job

I'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob



To be down with the Mob is simple

Mind your own you want a spot find your own

And take mine if you're badder than the strong man

I do the right thing I do the wrong thing

Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene

It's all about how much bacon you bring

And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it

Yo you ain't seen nothing

Cause if you testify you're living blind

Cause in the city you live and let die

Rolling with the fools One Time can't beat

On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet

He said ""I know you"" I said ""you might

My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like""

So he soaked me up like Bounty

Had to do a week in the county

A piece of cake it was just like a party

Cause in the county you know everybody

No I didn't kill or steal or rob

Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob



If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob

Watch your step cause the gat is kept

In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo

You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no

Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out

After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out

Get the picture or bitch

You'll get the eighty-six

If she wanna try and mix

Business and pleasure make up your own mind

You gotta be a hoe on your own time

Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep

Yo the Mob is still deep

And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit

You thought you got with the crew you can't get with

So get the noose ready for the lynching

Now 235 is what I'm benching

But nowadays it's still not enough

I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush

Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job

Rolling with the motherfucking Lench Mob"

Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Who's the mack? is it some brother in a big hat
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?

Rolling in a fucked-up Lincoln

Leaning to the side So it looks like he's sinking

Into that leopard interior

This nigga thinks every girl's inferior

To his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung

As she's selling more butt

Don't even get a cut of the money

His name is Sonny

And he know the play

And hope to od that he don't find a runaway

That's looking to become a star

He'll have your ass in and out of every car

With every on and Rick, sucking every john's dick

Come short of the money, get your ass kicked

You don't like it but you still call him hunk

Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk

You wanna leave but Sonny started talking fast

And it make you wanna go and sell more ass

He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that

Now ask yourself

Who's the mack?

Who's the mack?



It is that fool that wanna pump the gas

Give you a sad story and you give him cash?

He starts macking and macking and you sucking

Quick to say I'm down on my luck

And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way

Then you see his sorry ass the next day

Are you the one getting played like a sucka?

Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherfucker""?

Every day, the story gets better

He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-assed sweater

He claims he wants to get something to eat

But every day you find yourself getting beat

He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways

'cause he's in a daze

And almost get his ass hit for the crack

Now ask yourself

Who's the mack?

Who's the Mack?



Is it that nigga in that club asking

Have you ever been in a hot tub?

I know the game so I watch it unfold

When i see the boy pinned to your earlobe

He's talking shit and you crack a smile

When he tell you that he can go buck wild

For a girl like you and make it feel good

You know it's drama but it sound real good

He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging

The pussy so he can keep bragging

He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?""

The pussy so he can keep bragging

You wanna do it but you feeling like a H-O-E

You grab his hand, you leave and it's over

'Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover

Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back

Now ask yourself

Who's the Mack?

Macking is the game and everybody's playing

And as long as you believe what they saying

Consider the a M.A.C.K. and with no delay

They are gonna get all the play

But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma

It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a

Mack in my own right

When it comes to rhyme and rap

'cause all i do is kick facts

Unlike Iceberg Slimm

And all of them be claimin' be P.I.M.P.

No, I'm not going out that way

I'm just a straight up N I double G A

Next time U get over on a fool

And you did the shit like real smooth

Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts

And ask yourself

Who's the Mack?

Straight gangsta Mack

Straight gangsta Mack

Straight gangsta Mack

Straight gangsta Mack"

[Ice Cube]
Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand

Cause after I do ya

Huh I never knew ya

Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits

They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits

Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow

After we do it you can go home now

I'm a brother with a big long...



[Yo-Yo]

First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo

When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no

Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in

Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in

No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore

And if that's what you're here for

Exit through the door

There's more

To see of me but you're blind so

Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0



[Ice Cube]

Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo

I know you like to rap and like to flow so

But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world

Stay down and play the playground you little girl



[Yo-Yo]

What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping

Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening

It never fails I'll always get respect

And you lose so take a rain check



[Ice Cube]

Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second

If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant

And barefoot complaining that your back is aching

Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon



[Yo-Yo]

Well you're mistaken

It's not going that far

I make brothers like you play the back yard

You used to flow with the title but I took it

Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it



[Ice Cube]

Damn it look it

Cause you're talking a lot of bull



[Yo-Yo]

Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull



[Ice Cube]

This is a man's world thank you very much



[Yo-Yo]

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch



[Break]



[Ice Cube]

Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives

I hear females always talkin about women's lib

Well get your own crib

And stay there

Instead of having more babies for the welfare

Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger

The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga

For you to look at when your hair get nappy

So take a piece of the pole and be happy



[Yo-Yo]

Hell no because to me you're not a thriller

You come in the room with your three-inch killer

Thinking you can do damage to my backbone

Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown

I'm a put it like this my man

Without us your hand would be your best friend

So give us credit like you know you should

If I don't look good you don't look good



[Ice Cube]

I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant



[Yo-Yo]

But you don't know how funky that I can get



[Ice Cube]

This is a man's world thank you very much



[Yo-Yo]

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch



[Break]



[Ice Cube]

Man women I put a lot of fear in em

Cause I had it up to here with em

Drink a beer with em

No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day

Yeah if you know what I mean baby



[Yo-Yo]

Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe

If you was more of a man instead of faking it

Women deserve the credit when they're making it



[Ice Cube]

Yeah so what's the problem



[Yo-Yo]

Well I think we solved it

I know they know the best male from who's doggin it



[Ice Cube]

Yeah I admit you can flow



[Yo-Yo]

Well that's true



[Ice Cube]

But you see I'm a pro with the bank too



[Yo-Yo]

Yeah I can see you got it good



[Ice Cube]

Oh that I know



[Yo-Yo]

But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo

The brand-new intelligent black lady



[Ice Cube]

You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me



[Yo-Yo]

So what up then



[Ice Cube]

Girl what you tryin to do



[Yo-Yo]

To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through



[Ice Cube]

This is a man's world thank you very much



[Yo-Yo]

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Too much knowledge kicked then you're lost
In a shuffle of feet, Jinx the fiddler
And I control your mind like Hitler
You bow and vow to authority
See now, a sucker with a style just boring me

So I show K.N.O.W.

L.E.D.G.E. it might trouble you

Then I transform like a Decepticon

With a mic as a bomb

In my right palm

But I don't stay calm

So panic

Others can't flow so they go schizophrenic

You thought I dropped a dud in your face

Until you taste the blood of the bass

Then you faint, or better yet pass out

When I'm on the mic, believe it's ass out

You think you're raw so you draw

You lose, you're hung, you bite your tongue

The whole town saw in awe as you strangle

A noose on your neck, and you dangle

From side to side in the blazing heat

You're beat, you're dead, the fools fell off

You feel you're turning red, it's said

That your head burst

And this is only the first verse

Of the bomb



[Break]



Don't break up the fight let them rumble

Over the years I've watched some go super-bad quick

Now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach

Now ask yourself, who's stupid?

I take funky funky beats and I loop it

And pimp slap you in the face with the bass

And the boom from the bomb that I drop

Stop

You have a flat top as a fashion

I love Black women with a passion

But when they gotta go and show their ass in

I gotta clown the hoes, yeah

You gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres

They'll steer you wrong

Ice Cube's got it going on, hit me

For the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme

The system ain't wholesome

They want to put a young brother in Folsom

And others see me on lockdown

But I come up foul then they get knocked out, word

To the brother that rolls the herb

Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that

Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact

He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap

Now who's the mack?

Who's the hoe?

Who's the trick?

I got many, many styles won't you take a pick

But don't be alarmed

When I trip and stumble and fumble

And drop the (rewind)

Drop the bomb



[Break]



I'm solo, you ask how I'm living

Still dropping more shit than a pigeon

With the L, the E, the N, the C, the H,

The M, the O, the B, the great

Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha

It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers

And if you try to upset the pot son

You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun

I make the beats, I make the breaks

I make the rhymes that make you shake

Make you find

Ice Cube never caught in the middle

I make shit to kick you in the ass a little

And still never hesitate to stutter step

Or bust a repitition on the mic

Still dissing all the hype

From left to right

How many left to fight?

So what that Lench Mob like?"
